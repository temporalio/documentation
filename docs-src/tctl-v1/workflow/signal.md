The `tctl workflow signal` command [Signals](/concepts/what-is-a-signal) a [Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution).

Workflows listen for Signals by their Signal name, and can be made to listen to one or more Signal names.
Workflows can also listen for SQL queries.

The Workflow below listens for instances of "HelloSignal":

```bash
tctl workflow start  --workflow_id "HelloSignal" --taskqueue HelloWorldTaskQueue --workflow_type HelloWorld --execution_timeout 3600 --input \"World\"
```

The Worker would return this output upon receiving the Signal:

```text
13:57:44.258 [workflow-method] INFO  c.t.s.javaquickstart.GettingStarted - 1: Hello World!
```

Signals can also be used to change variable values.

```bash
tctl workflow signal --workflow_id "HelloSignal" --name "updateGreeting" --input \"Hi\"
```

The output would change from the first Signal received.

```text
13:57:44.258 [workflow-method] INFO  c.t.s.javaquickstart.GettingStarted - 1: Hello World!
13:58:22.352 [workflow-method] INFO  c.t.s.javaquickstart.GettingStarted - 2: Hi World!
```

When a Signal is sent, an await condition is made to block any Signals that contain the same input value.
However, changing the greeting in our example unblocks it:

```bash
tctl workflow signal --workflow_id "HelloSignal" --name "updateGreeting" --input \"Welcome\"
```

Worker output:

```text
13:57:44.258 [workflow-method] INFO  c.t.s.javaquickstart.GettingStarted - 1: Hello World!
13:58:22.352 [workflow-method] INFO  c.t.s.javaquickstart.GettingStarted - 2: Hi World!
13:59:29.097 [workflow-method] INFO  c.t.s.javaquickstart.GettingStarted - 3: Welcome World!
```

Sending Signals does not require a running Worker.

```bash
tctl workflow signal --workflow_id "HelloSignal" --name "updateGreeting" --input \"Welcome\"
```

CLI output:

```text
Signal workflow succeeded.
```

The Signal request is queued inside the Temporal Server until the Worker is restarted.
If the given Signal contains the same input as before, the queued Signal will be ignored.

Complete the Workflow by sending a Signal with a "Bye" greeting:

```bash
tctl workflow signal --workflow_id "HelloSignal" --name "updateGreeting" --input \"Bye\"
```

Check that the Workflow Execution has been completed.

```bash
tctl workflow showid HelloSignal
```

Signals are written as follows:

```bash
tctl workflow signal --workflow_id <id> <modifiers>
```

or

```bash
tctl workflow signal --query <query> <modifiers>
```

The following modifiers control the behavior of the command.
Make sure to include required modifiers in all command executions.

### --workflow_id

Specify a [Workflow Id](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id). **This modifier is required.**

Alias: `-w`

**Example**

```bash
tctl workflow signal --workflow_id <id>
```

### --run_id

Specify a [Run Id](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id).

Alias: `-r`

**Example**

```bash
tctl workflow signal --run_id <id>
```

### --name

Specify the name of a [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal).

**Example**

```bash
tctl workflow signal --query <query> --name <name>
```

### --input

Pass input for the [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal).
Input must be in JSON format.

Alias: `-i`

**Example**

```bash
tctl workflow signal --query <query> --input <json>
```

### --input_file

Pass input for the [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal) from a JSON file.

**Example**

```bash
tctl workflow signal --query <query> --input_file <filename>
```
