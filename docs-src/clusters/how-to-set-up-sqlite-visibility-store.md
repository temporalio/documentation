You can set SQLite as your [Visibility store](/concepts/what-is-visibility).
Verify [supported versions](/clusters/how-to-set-up-visibility-in-a-temporal-cluster#supported-databases) before you proceed.

Temporal supports only an in-memory database with SQLite; this means that the database is automatically created when Temporal Server starts and is destroyed when Temporal Server stops.

You can change the configuration to use a file-based database so that it is preserved when Temporal Server stops.
However, if you use a file-based SQLite database, upgrading your database schema to enable Advanced Visibility features is not supported; in this case, you must delete the database and create it again to upgrade.

If using SQLite v3.31.0 and later as your Visibility store with Temporal Server v1.20 and later, any [custom Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute#custom-search-attributes) that you create must be associated with a Namespace in that Cluster.

**Persistence configuration**

Set your SQLite Visibility store name in the `visibilityStore` parameter in your Persistence configuration, and then define the Visibility store configuration under `datastores`.

The following example shows how to set a Visibility store `sqlite-visibility` and define the datastore configuration in your Temporal Cluster Configuration YAML.

```yaml
persistence:
  # ...
  visibilityStore: sqlite-visibility
  # ...
  datastores:
    # ...
    sqlite-visibility:
      sql:
        user: "username_for_auth"
        password: "password_for_auth"
        pluginName: "sqlite"
        databaseName: "default"
        connectAddr: "localhost"
        connectProtocol: "tcp"
        connectAttributes:
          mode: "memory"
          cache: "private"
        maxConns: 1
        maxIdleConns: 1
        maxConnLifetime: "1h"
        tls:
          enabled: false
          caFile: ""
          certFile: ""
          keyFile: ""
          enableHostVerification: false
          serverName: ""
```

SQLite (v3.31.0 and later) has Advanced Visiibility enabled by default.

**Database schema and setup**

Visibility data is stored in a database table called `executions_visibility` that must be set up according to the schemas defined (by supported versions) in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/schema/sqlite/v3/visibility/schema.sql.

For an example of setting up the SQLite schema, see [Temporalite](https://github.com/temporalio/temporalite/blob/main/server.go) setup.
