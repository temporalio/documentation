[Advanced Visibility](/concepts/what-is-advanced-visibility) features depend on an integration with Elasticsearch.

To integrate Elasticsearch with your Temporal Cluster, edit the `persistence` section of your `development.yaml` configuration file and run the index schema setup commands.

:::note

These steps are needed only if you have a "plain" [Temporal Server Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/server).

If you operate a Temporal Cluster using our [Helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts) or
[Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose), the Elasticsearch index schema and index are created automatically using the [auto-setup Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/auto-setup).

:::

#### Edit persistence

1. Add the `advancedVisibilityStore: es-visibility` key-value pair to the `persistence` section.
   The [development_es.yaml](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/config/development_es.yaml) file in the `temporalio/temporal` repo is a working example.
   The configuration instructs the Temporal Cluster how and where to connect to Elasticsearch storage.

```yaml
persistence:
  ...
  advancedVisibilityStore: es-visibility
```

2. Define the Elasticsearch datastore connection information under the `es-visibility` key:

```yaml
persistence:
  ...
  advancedVisibilityStore: es-visibility
  datastores:
    ...
    es-visibility:
      elasticsearch:
        version: "v7"
        url:
          scheme: "http"
          host: "127.0.0.1:9200"
        indices:
          visibility: temporal_visibility_v1_dev
```

#### Create index schema and index

Run the following commands to create the index schema and index:

```bash
# ES_SERVER is the URL of Elasticsearch server; for example, "http://localhost:9200".
SETTINGS_URL="${ES_SERVER}/_cluster/settings"
SETTINGS_FILE=${TEMPORAL_HOME}/schema/elasticsearch/visibility/cluster_settings_${ES_VERSION}.json
TEMPLATE_URL="${ES_SERVER}/_template/temporal_visibility_v1_template"
SCHEMA_FILE=${TEMPORAL_HOME}/schema/elasticsearch/visibility/index_template_${ES_VERSION}.json
INDEX_URL="${ES_SERVER}/${ES_VIS_INDEX}"
curl --fail --user "${ES_USER}":"${ES_PWD}" -X PUT "${SETTINGS_URL}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary "@${SETTINGS_FILE}" --write-out "\n"
curl --fail --user "${ES_USER}":"${ES_PWD}" -X PUT "${TEMPLATE_URL}" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary "@${SCHEMA_FILE}" --write-out "\n"
curl --user "${ES_USER}":"${ES_PWD}" -X PUT "${INDEX_URL}" --write-out "\n"
```

#### Set Elasticsearch privileges

Ensure that the following privileges are granted for the Elasticsearch Temporal index:

- **Read**
  - [index privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices): `create`, `index`, `delete`, `read`
- **Write**
  - [index privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices): `write`
- **Custom Search Attributes**
  - [index privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices): `manage`
  - [cluster privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster): `monitor` or `manage`.

#### Add custom Search Attributes (optional)

This step is optional.

Here we are adding custom Search Attributes to your Cluster.

Run the following command to create search attributes: `tctl search-attribute create`
