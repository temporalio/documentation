Welcome to the self-hosted Temporal Cluster guide.
This guide shows you how to self-host open source infrastructure software that supervises your durable applications.

:::info Sign up for Temporal Cloud!

Instead of self-hosting, you can use [Temporal Cloud](/cloud).

:::

:::info Getting started with Temporal?

If you are just getting started with Temporal, we recommend our [introductory tutorials and courses](https://learn.temporal.io)

:::

:::info Buidling an app?

If you are building a new Temporal Application, you might only need a [development server](/cli/start-dev-server) available through the [Temporal CLI](/concepts/what-is-the-temporal-cli).
Check out the [dev guide](/dev-guide) for application development best practices.
