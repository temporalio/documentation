Specify a list of [Temporal Clusters](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster) when registering a [Namespace](/namespaces#).

The flag contains a single name of a Cluster to which the Namespace can fail over. For multiple Clusters pass each in a separate `--cluster` option.
Make sure to include to the currently active Cluster.
This is a read-only setting and cannot be changed.

This modifier is valid only when the `--global` modifier is set to true.
