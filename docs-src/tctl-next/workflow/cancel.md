The `tctl workflow cancel` command cancels a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution).

Canceling a running Workflow Execution records a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in the History.
A new command task will be scheduled.
After cancellation, the Workflow Execution can perform cleanup work.

The use of the [`--query` modifier](/tctl-next/modifiers#--query) (`tctl workflow cancel --query`) automatically starts a [batch job](/tctl-next/batch) that cancels Workflow Executions according to the List Filter provided.

`tctl workflow cancel --query <value> <modifiers>`

The following modifiers are supported and control the behavior of the command.
Always include required modifiers when executing this command.

- [--namespace](/tctl-next/modifiers#--namespace)
- [--query](/tctl-next/modifiers#--query)
- [--reason](/tctl-next/modifiers#--reason)
- [--yes](/tctl-next/modifiers#--yes)
