The `tctl workflow cancel` command cancels a [Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution).

Canceling a running Workflow Execution records a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in the History.
A new command task will be scheduled.
After cancellation, the Workflow Execution can perform cleanup work.
