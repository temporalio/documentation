A "batch" command enables you to affect multiple existing [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution) with a single command.
A batch job runs in the background and affects Workflow Executions one at a time.

In tctl version-next you can run the typical Signal Workflow, Terminate Workflow, and Cancel Workflow batch jobs using the `tctl workflow signal`, `tctl workflow terminate`, and `tctl workflow cancel` commands respectively.
The batch command is automatically started when the [`--query` modifier](/tctl-next/modifiers#--query) is provided with those commands.

In tctl version-next, the `tctl batch` commands are used solely to view the status of and terminate the batch jobs.

The `--query` modifier supports a [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter).
The List Filter identifies the set of Workflow Executions to be affected by the command.

A successfully started batch job returns a Job ID.
You can use this Job ID in the `tctl batch describe` command, which describes the progress of a specific batch job.

You can also use the Job ID to terminate the batch job itself.
Terminating a batch job does not roll back the operations already performed by the batch job.
