A Go-based Activity Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination (same as a Workflow Definition).
You may wish to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values, just keep in mind they must all be serializable.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/main/yourapp/your_activity_definition_dacx.go) in the context of the rest of the application code.

:::

```go
// YourActivityResultObject is the struct returned from your Activity.
// Use a struct so that you can return multiple values of different types.
// Additionally, your function signature remains compatible if the fields change.
type YourActivityResultObject struct {
	ResultFieldX string
	ResultFieldY int
}
// ...
func (a *YourActivityObject) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (*YourActivityResultObject, error) {
// ...
	result := &YourActivityResultObject{
		ResultFieldX: "Success",
		ResultFieldY: 1,
	}
	// Return the results back to the Workflow Execution.
	// The results persist within the Event History of the Workflow Execution.
	return result, nil
}
```
