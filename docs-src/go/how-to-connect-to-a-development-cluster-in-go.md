Use the [`Dial()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Dial) API available in the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client) package to create a [`Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client).

If you don't provide [`HostPort`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions), the Client defaults the address and port number to `127.0.0.1:7233`, which is the port of the development Cluster.

If you don't set a custom Namespace name in the Namespace field, the client connects to the default Namespace.

	// A Temporal Client is a heavyweight object that should be created just once per process.
