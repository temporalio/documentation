The [Go SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go) provides support for distributed tracing with **_Interceptors_**.
Interceptors uses Temporal headers to create a call graph of a [Workflow](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow), along with its [Activities](/concepts/what-is-an-activity) and [Child Workflows](/concepts/what-is-a-child-workflow-execution).

There are several tracing implementations supported by the Temporal Go SDK.
For an [OpenTracing](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/opentracing) Interceptor, use `opentracing.NewInterceptor(opentracing.TracerOptions{})` to create a `TracingInterceptor`.

```go
// create Interceptor
tracingInterceptor, err := opentracing.NewInterceptor(opentracing.TracerOptions{})
```

For an [OpenTelemetry](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/opentelemetry) Interceptor, use `opentelemetry.NewTracingInterceptor(opentelemetry.TracerOptions{})`.

```go
// create Interceptor
tracingInterceptor, err := opentelemetry.NewTracingInterceptor(opentelemetry.TracerOptions{})
```

For a [Datadog](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/datadog/tracing) Interceptor, use `tracing.NewTracingInterceptor(tracing.TracerOptions{})`.

```go
// create Interceptor
tracingInterceptor, err := tracing.NewTracingInterceptor(tracing.TracerOptions{})
```

Pass the newly created Interceptor to [ClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions) to enable tracing.

```go
c, err := client.Dial(client.Options{
  Interceptors:       []interceptor.ClientInterceptor{tracingInterceptor},
})
```

OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry are natively supported by [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.46/features/#native-support-for-opentracing-and-opentelemetry).
For more information on configuring and using tracing, see the documentation provided by [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io), [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), and [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/).
