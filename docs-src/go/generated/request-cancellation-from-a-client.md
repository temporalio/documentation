```go
func main() {
// ...
	// Call the CancelWorkflow API to cancel a Workflow
	// In this call we are relying on the Workflow Id only.
	// But a Run Id can also be supplied to ensure the correct Workflow is Canceled.
	err = temporalClient.CancelWorkflow(context.Background(), cancellation.WorkflowId, "")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Unable to cancel Workflow Execution", err)
	}
// ...
}
```
