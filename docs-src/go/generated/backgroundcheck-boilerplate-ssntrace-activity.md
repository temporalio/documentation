In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity is an exportable function or a `struct` method.
Below is an example of an Activity defined as a function.

```go
package activities

import (
	"context"
)


// SSNTraceActivity is your custom Activity Definition.
func SSNTraceActivity(ctx context.Context, param string) (*string, error) {
	// This is where a call to another service is made
	// Here we are pretending that the service that does SSNTrace returned "pass"
	result := "pass"
	return &result, nil
}
```
