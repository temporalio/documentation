In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity is an exportable function or a `struct` method.
Below is an example of an Activity defined as a function.

<div class="copycode-notice-container"><div class="copycode-notice"><img data-style="copycode-icon" src="/icons/copycode.png" alt="Copy code icon" /> Sample application code information <img id="i-id-1241893881" data-event="clickable-copycode-info" data-style="chevron-icon" src="/icons/chevron.png" alt="Chevron icon" /></div><div id="copycode-info-id-1241893881" class="copycode-info">The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application. The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects. Visit the source repository to <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/go/dev-guide/chapters/setup/activities/ssntraceactivity.go">view the source code</a> in the context of the rest of the application code.</div></div>

```go
package activities

import (
	"context"
)


// SSNTraceActivity is your custom Activity Definition.
func SSNTraceActivity(ctx context.Context, param string) (*string, error) {
	// This is where a call to another service is made
	// Here we are pretending that the service that does SSNTrace returned "pass"
	result := "pass"
	return &result, nil
}
```
