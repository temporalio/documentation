Calling `env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` executes the Workflow logic and any invoked Activities inside the test process.
The first parameter of `env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` contains a reference to Workflow function and any parameters that the Workflow needs.

The call to `env.OnActivity` is important, because if this call is not made to "mock" the execution or another function is used to replace it, the test environment will execute the actual Activity code including any calls to outside services.

After executing the Workflow in the above example, we assert that the Workflow ran through completion via the call to `env.IsWorkflowComplete()`.
We also assert that no errors were returned by asserting on the return value of `env.GetWorkflowError()`.

If our Workflow returned a value, we could have retrieved that value via a call to `s.env.GetWorkflowResult(&value)` and had additional asserts on that value.
