Create an instance of [`Worker`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#Worker) by calling [`worker.New()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#New), available through the `go.temporal.io/sdk/worker` package, and pass it the following parameters:

1. An instance of the Temporal Go SDK `Client`.
1. The name of the Task Queue that it will poll.
1. An instance of `worker.Options`, which can be empty.

Then, register the Workflow Types and the Activity Types that the Worker will be capable of executing.

Lastly, call either the `Start()` or the `Run()` method on the instance of the Worker.
Run accepts an interrupt channel as a parameter, so that the Worker can be stopped in the terminal.
Otherwise, the `Stop()` method must be called to stop the Worker.

:::tip

If you have [`gow`](https://github.com/mitranim/gow) installed, the Worker Process automatically "reloads" when you update the Worker file:

```bash
go install github.com/mitranim/gow@latest
gow run worker/main.go # automatically reloads when file changes
```
