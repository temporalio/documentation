sidebar_label: Handle Cancellation in Workflow
description: You can design your Workflow to run clean up Activities, and change to a Canceled status when a Cancellation Request is received.

If the Workflow receives a Cancellation Request, but all Activities gracefully handle the Cancellation, and/or no Activities are skipped then the Workflow status will be Complete.
It is completely up to the needs of the business process and your use case which determines whether you want to return the Cancellation error to show a Canceled status or Complete status regardless of whether a Cancellation has propagated to and/or skipped Activities.

```go
// YourWorkflow is a Workflow Definition that shows how it can be canceled.
func YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) error {
// ...
	activityOptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
// ...
		WaitForCancellation: true,
	}
	defer func() {
		// This logic ensures cleanup only happens if there is a Cancelation error
		if !errors.Is(ctx.Err(), workflow.ErrCanceled) {
			return
		}
		// For the Workflow to execute an Activity after it receives a Cancellation Request
		// It has to get a new disconnected context
		newCtx, _ := workflow.NewDisconnectedContext(ctx)
		// This Activity is only executed if
		err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(newCtx, a.CleanupActivity).Get(ctx, nil)
		if err != nil {
			logger.Error("CleanupActivity failed", "Error", err)
		}
	}()
// ...
	err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, a.ActivityToBeCanceled).Get(ctx, &result)
// ...
	// This call to execute the Activity is expected to return an error "canceled".
	// And the Activity Execution is skipped.
	err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, a.ActivityToBeSkipped).Get(ctx, nil)
// ...
	// Return any errors.
	// If a CanceledError is returned, the Workflow changes to a Canceled state.
	return err
