We can test Workflow code for the following conditions:

- Workflow status. For example, did the Workflow reach a completed status?
- Workflow returned an error. Did the Workflow function return an error?
- Error when checking for a result of a Workflow. Is there an error in getting the result returned by the Workflow?
- Workflow return value. If the Workflow did return something other than an error, is it what you expected it to be?

We can also perform a Workflow Replay test, and we'll provide detailed coverage of this topic in another section.

```go
const ssn string = "555-55-5555"

// Test_BackgroundCheckWorkflow tests the BackgroundCheck Workflow function
func (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_BackgroundCheckWorkflow() {
	// Initialize a Temporal Go SDK Workflow test environment.
	// The best practice is to create a new environment for each Workflow test.
	// Doing so ensures that each test runs in its own isolated sandbox.
	env := s.NewTestWorkflowEnvironment()
	// Mock the Activity Execution for the Workflow
	ssnTraceResult := "pass"
	env.OnActivity(activities.SSNTraceActivity, mock.Anything, ssn).Return(&ssnTraceResult, nil)
	// Run the Workflow in the test environment
	env.ExecuteWorkflow(workflows.BackgroundCheck, ssn)
	// Check that the Workflow reach a completed status
	s.True(env.IsWorkflowCompleted())
	// Check whether the Workflow returned an error
	s.NoError(env.GetWorkflowError())
	// Check that no error is returned while getting the result
	// And check for the expected value of the Workflow result
	var result string
	s.NoError(env.GetWorkflowResult(&result))
	s.Equal(result, ssnTraceResult)
}
```
