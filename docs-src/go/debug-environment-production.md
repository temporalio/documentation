You can debug production Workflows using:

- [Web UI](/web-ui)
- [tctl](/tctl-v1)
- [Replay](/go/testing#replay)
- [Tracing](/go/tracing)
- [Logging](/go/logging)

You can debug and tune Worker performance with metrics and the [Worker performance guide](/dev-guide/worker-performance).
For more information, see [Metrics](/go/metrics) for setting up SDK metrics.

Debug Server performance with [Cloud metrics](/cloud/metrics-intro) or [self-hosted Server metrics](/kb/legacy-oss-prod-deploy#scaling-and-metrics).
