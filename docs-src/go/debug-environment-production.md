You can debug production Workflows using:

- [Web UI](/web-ui)
- [tctl](/tctl-v1)
- [Replay](/go/testing#replay)
- [Tracing](/go/features/tracing/introduction)
- [Logging](/go/logging)

You can debug and tune Worker performance with metrics and the [Worker performance guide](/dev-guide/worker-performance).
For more information, see [Metrics](/go/features/metrics/metrics) for setting up SDK metrics.

Debug Server performance with [Cloud metrics](/cloud/metrics-intro) or [self-hosted Server metrics](/self-hosted/scaling-and-metrics).
