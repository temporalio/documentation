A Go-based Workflow Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination.
Again, the best practice here is to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values.
A Workflow Definition written in Go can return both a custom value and an error.
However, it's not possible to receive both a custom value and an error in the calling process, as is normal in Go.
The caller will receive either one or the other.
Returning a non-nil `error` from a Workflow indicates that an error was encountered during its execution and the Workflow Execution should be terminated, and any custom return values will be ignored by the system.

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.

```go
package yourapp

import (
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)
// ...

// YourWorkflowResultObject is the object returned by the Workflow.
type YourWorkflowResultObject struct {
	WFResultFieldX string
	WFResultFieldY int
}
// ...
// YourWorkflowDefinition is your custom Workflow Definition.
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (*YourWorkflowResultObject, error) {
// ...
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	// Make the results of the Workflow Execution available.
	workflowResult := &YourWorkflowResultObject{
		WFResultFieldX: activityResult.ResultFieldX,
		WFResultFieldY: activityResult.ResultFieldY,
	}
	return workflowResult, nil
}
```
