    To spawn an [Activity Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution), call [`ExecuteActivity()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/workflow#ExecuteActivity) inside your Workflow Definition.
    The API is available from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/workflow) package.
    The `ExecuteActivity()` API call requires an instance of `workflow.Context`, the Activity function name, and any variables to be passed to the Activity Execution.
    	The Activity function name can be provided as a variable object (no quotations) or as a string.
        The benefit of passing the actual function object is that the framework can validate the parameters against the Activity Definition.
        The `ExecuteActivity` call returns a Future, which can be used to get the result of the Activity Execution.

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (*YourWorkflowResultObject, error) {
	// Set the options for the Activity Execution.
	// Either StartToClose Timeout OR ScheduleToClose is required.
	// Not specifying a Task Queue will default to the parent Workflow Task Queue.
	activityOptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
		StartToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
	}
	ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityOptions)
	activityParam := YourActivityParam{
		ActivityParamX: param.WorkflowParamX,
		ActivityParamY: param.WorkflowParamY,
	}
	// Use a nil struct pointer to call Activities that are part of a struct.
	var a *YourActivityObject
	// Execute the Activity and wait for the result.
	var activityResult YourActivityResultObject
	err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, a.YourActivityDefinition, activityParam).Get(ctx, &activityResult)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
// ...
}
```
