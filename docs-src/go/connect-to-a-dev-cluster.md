A [Temporal Client](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the [Temporal Cluster](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster).
Communication with a Temporal Cluster includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.

:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.

:::

When you are running a Cluster locally (such as [Temporalite](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#temporalite)), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.
Many SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and [Docker Compose](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#docker-compose) serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).
