:::info Auto restart worker when code changes

Use [`gow`](https://github.com/mitranim/gow) to automatically restart the Worker Process whenever any of the Go code files in your project change.

```shell
go install github.com/mitranim/gow@latest
gow worker/main.go # automatically restarts when the project files change
```
