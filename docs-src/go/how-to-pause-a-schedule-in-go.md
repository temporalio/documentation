`Pause` and `Unpause` enable the start or stop of all future Workflow Runs on a given Schedule.

Pausing a Schedule halts all future Workflow Runs.
Pausing can be enabled by setting `State.Paused` to `true`, or by using `Pause()` on the ScheduleHandle.

Unpausing a Schedule allows the Workflow to execute as planned.
To unpause a Schedule, use `Unpause()` on `ScheduleHandle`.
