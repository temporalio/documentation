Add the Replay test to the set of application tests.
The Replayer is available from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/worker` package in the SDK.
Register the Workflow Definition and then specify an existing Event History to compare to.

Run the tests in the test directory (`go test`).
If the Workflow Definition and the Event History are incompatible then the test fails.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/main/backgroundcheck_replay/tests/backgroundcheck_test.go) in the context of the rest of the application code.

:::

```go
// TestReplayWorkflowHistoryFromFile tests for Event History compatability.
func (s *UnitTestSuite) TestReplayWorkflowHistoryFromFile() {
	// Create a new Replayer
	replayer := worker.NewWorkflowReplayer()
	// Register the Workflow with the Replayer
	replayer.RegisterWorkflow(workflows.BackgroundCheck)
	// Compare the current Workflow code against the existing Event History
	err := replayer.ReplayWorkflowHistoryFromJSONFile(nil, "backgroundcheck_workflow_event_history.json")
```
