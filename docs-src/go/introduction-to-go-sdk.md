Welcome to the Temporal Go SDK developer’s guide!

:::success Temporal Go SDK API reference

https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk

:::

The open source Temporal Go SDK was released on September 29, 2020. This guide documents the concepts, features, and tools needed to create, test, and execute Temporal applications in Go.

## What Go programming skills and experiences are useful when using the Go SDK?

The Temporal Platform enables developers to build a wide range of applications that serve a wide range of use cases.

We recommend that developers possess at least a moderate level of experience in practicing the following skills to develop production-level Temporal Applications:

### Core fundamentals

- Go syntax and structure
- Data types
  - [structs](https://pkg.go.dev/go/types@go1.21.0#Struct)
- Operators
- Control statements (loops, conditionals)
- Basic input/output

### Object-oriented programming

- Interfaces
- Pointers

### Go language features

- Goroutines
- Channels
- Concurrency patterns - parallelism, producer-consumer, etc.
  - The Temporal Go SDK provides [deterministic wrappers](https://community.temporal.io/t/workflow-determinism/4027) for Go's concurrency primitives
- Context handling
- Defer and panic handling
- Error handling
- [Go toolchain](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module)

### Recommendations

Developers should have some experience with the Go testing package and the open-source Testify library.

In addition, developers should also have a beginner to moderate level of experience with an IDE such as Visual Studio Code, GoLand, or vim.

Developers should have some experience using a version control system, such as Git.

For complex and large-scale use cases, having some experience with the following could be helpful:

#### Advanced Language Features

- Reflection
- Generics
- Memory management

#### Design patterns

- Creational: Factory, Singleton, Object Pool, Builder, etc.
- Stability: Bulkheads, Deadline, etc.

#### Databases

- Familiarity with SQL or NoSQL databases
- CRUD operational concepts

#### Distributed system architectures

- **Event-driven architectures**: Understanding of how events can drive processes and how they fit into workflows.
- **Stateful vs. stateless processes**: Knowledge about the advantages and pitfalls of both.
- **Scalability**: Understanding the implications, of scaling services, on performance and reliability.
- **Fault tolerance**: Knowledge of supervisor systems that monitor progress and resume after suspensions.
