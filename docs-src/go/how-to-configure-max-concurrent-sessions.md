To limit the number of concurrent Sessions running on a Worker, set the `MaxConcurrentSessionExecutionSize` field of `worker.Options` to the desired value.
By default, this field is set to a very large value, so there's no need to manually set it if no limitation is needed.

If a Worker hits this limitation, it won't accept any new `CreateSession()` requests until one of the existing sessions is completed.
If the session can't be created within `CreationTimeout`, `CreateSession()` returns an error .

```go
func main() {
// ...
	workerOptions := worker.Options{
// ...
		// This configures the maximum allowed concurrent sessions.
		// Customize this value only if you need to.
		MaxConcurrentSessionExecutionSize: 1000,
// ...
}
// ...
```
