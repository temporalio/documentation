Schedules are initiated with the `create` call.
The user generates a unique Schedule ID for each new Schedule.

To create a Schedule in Go, use `Create()` on the [Client](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-client).
Schedules must be initialized with a Schedule ID, [Spec](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule#spec), and [Action](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule#action) in `client.ScheduleOptions{}`.

```go
func main() {
// ...
	scheduleID := "schedule_id"
	workflowID := "schedule_workflow_id"
	// Create the schedule.
	scheduleHandle, err := temporalClient.ScheduleClient().Create(ctx, client.ScheduleOptions{
		ID:   scheduleID,
		Spec: client.ScheduleSpec{},
		Action: &client.ScheduleWorkflowAction{
			ID:        workflowID,
			Workflow:  schedule.ScheduleWorkflow,
			TaskQueue: "schedule",
