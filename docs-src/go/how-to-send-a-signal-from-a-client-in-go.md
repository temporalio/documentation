Use the `SignalWorkflow()` method on an instance of the [Go SDK Temporal Client](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client) to send a [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal) to a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution).

Pass in both the [Workflow Id](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id) and [Run Id](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id) to uniquely identify the Workflow Execution.
If only the Workflow Id is supplied (provide an empty string as the Run Id param), the Workflow Execution that is Running receives the Signal.

```go
// ...
signal := MySignal {
  Message: "Some important data",
}
err = temporalClient.SignalWorkflow(context.Background(), "your-workflow-id", runID, "your-signal-name", signal)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("Error sending the Signal", err)
	return
}
// ...
```

Possible errors:

- `serviceerror.NotFound`
- `serviceerror.Internal`
- `serviceerror.Unavailable`
