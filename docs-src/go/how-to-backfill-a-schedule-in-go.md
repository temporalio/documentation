Backfilling a Schedule executes [Workflow Tasks](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-task) ahead of the Schedule's specified time range.
This is useful for executing a missed or delayed Action, or for testing the Workflow ahead of time.

To backfill a Schedule in Go, use `Backfill()` on `ScheduleHandle`.
Specify the start and end times to execute the Workflow, along with the overlap policy.

```go
func main() {
// ...
	err = scheduleHandle.Backfill(ctx, client.ScheduleBackfillOptions{
		Backfill: []client.ScheduleBackfill{
			{
				Start:   now.Add(-4 * time.Minute),
				End:     now.Add(-2 * time.Minute),
				Overlap: enums.SCHEDULE_OVERLAP_POLICY_ALLOW_ALL,
			},
			{
				Start:   now.Add(-2 * time.Minute),
				End:     now,
				Overlap: enums.SCHEDULE_OVERLAP_POLICY_ALLOW_ALL,
			},
		},
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Unable to Backfill Schedule", err)
