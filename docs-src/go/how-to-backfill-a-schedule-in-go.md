description: Backfill a Schedule to execute a Workflow at a later time.
---

Backfilling a [Schedule](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule) executes Actions ahead of the Schedule's specified time range.
This is useful for executing a missed or delayed [Action](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule#action), or for testing the [Workflow](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow) ahead of time.

To backfill a Schedule in Go, use `Backfill()` on [`ScheduleHandle`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ScheduleClient).
Specify the start and end times to execute the Workflow, along with the [Overlap Policy](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule#overlap-policy).

```go
func main() {
// ...
		Backfill: []client.ScheduleBackfill{
			{
				Start: now.Add(-4 * time.Minute),
				End: now.Add(-2 * time.Minute),
				Overlap: enums.SCHEDULE_OVERLAP_POLICY_ALLOW_ALL,
			},
			{
				Start: now.Add(-2 * time.Minute),
				End: now,
				Overlap: enums.SCHEDULE_OVERLAP_POLICY_ALLOW_ALL,
			},
		},
	})
		
// ...
