Operator commands enable actions on [Namespaces](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace), [Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute), and [Temporal Clusters](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster).
These actions are performed through subcommands for each Operator area.

To run an Operator command, run `temporal operator [command] [subcommand] [command options]`.
