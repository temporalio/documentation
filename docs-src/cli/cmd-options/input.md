Use the `--input` command option to include data in the command.

This command option accepts a valid JSON string.
If the entity that the command is acting on accepts multiple parameters, pass "null" for null values within the JSON string.

The following is an example of starting a Workflow with the `--input` command option.
This Workflow expects a single string as a parameter:

```shell
temporal workflow start --input '"+1 555-555-5555"'
```
