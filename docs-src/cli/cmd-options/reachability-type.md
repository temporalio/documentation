Specify how you'd like to filter the reachability of Build IDs.
The following are valid choices:

- `open`: reachable by one or more open Workflows.
- `closed`: reachable by one or more closed Workflows.
- `existing`: reachable by either open or closed Workflows.

Build IDs that are reachable by new Workflows are always reported.
