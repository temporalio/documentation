The `temporal schedule delete` command deletes a [Schedule](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule).
Deleting a Schedule does not affect any [Workflows](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow) started by the Schedule.

[Workflow Executions](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution) started by Schedules can be cancelled or terminated like other Workflow Executions.
However, Workflow Executions started by a Schedule can be identified by their [Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute), making them targetable by batch command for termination.
