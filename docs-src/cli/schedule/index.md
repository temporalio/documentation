Schedule commands allow the user to create, use, and update [Schedules](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule).
Schedules control when certain Actions for a [Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution) are performed, making it a useful tool for automation.

To run a Schedule command, run `temporal schedule [command] [command options]`.
