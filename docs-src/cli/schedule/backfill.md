The `temporal schedule backfill` command executes Actions ahead of their specified time range.
Backfilling can be used to fill in [Workflow Runs](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id) from a time period when the Schedule was paused, or from before the Schedule was created.

Schedule backfills require a valid Schedule ID, along with the time in which to run the Schedule and a change to the overlap policy.

```
temporal schedule backfill --sid 'your-schedule-id' \
--overlap-policy 'BufferAll' 				\
--start-time '2022-05-0101T00:00:00Z'		\
--end-time '2022-05-31T23:59:59Z'
```
