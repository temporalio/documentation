The `temporal schedule trigger` command triggers an immediate action with a given [Schedule](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule).
By default, this action is subject to the Overlap Policy of the Schedule.

Schedule triggers are passed in this format:
`temporal schedule trigger` can be used to start a Workflow Run immediately.
`temporal schedule trigger --schedule-id 'your-schedule-id'`

The Overlap Policy of the Schedule can be overridden as well.
`temporal schedule trigger --schedule-id 'your-schedule-id' --overlap-policy 'AllowAll'`
