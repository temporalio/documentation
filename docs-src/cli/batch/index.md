Batch commands allow you to change multiple [Workflow Executions](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution) in the background.
In order to do this, you provide the command with a [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-visibility) and the type of Batch job to execute.

The List Filter identifies the Workflow Executions that will be affected by the Batch job.
The Batch type determines the other parameters that need to be provided, along with what is being affected on the Workflow Executions.

There are three types of Batch Jobs:

- Signal: sends a [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal) to the Workflow Executions specified by the List Filter.
- Cancel: cancels the Workflow Executions specified by the List Filter.
- Terminate: terminates the Workflow Executions specified by the List Filter.

A successfully started Batch job will return a Job ID.
Use this Job ID to execute other actions on the Batch job.
