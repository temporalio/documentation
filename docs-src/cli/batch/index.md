Batch commands change multiple [Workflow Executions](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution) by providing a [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-visibility) and the type of Batch Job to execute.
The List Filter identifies the Workflow Executions in the Batch Job; the Batch type determines what will happen to the Workflow Executions.

There are three types of Batch Jobs:

- Signal: sends a [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal) to the Workflow Executions specified by the List Filter.
- Cancel: cancels the Workflow Executions specified by the List Filter.
- Terminate: terminates the Workflow Executions specified by the List Filter.

A successfully started Batch job will return a Job ID.
Use this Job ID to execute other actions on the Batch job.
