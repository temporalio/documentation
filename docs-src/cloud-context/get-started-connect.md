Connecting your [Temporal Clients](/temporal#temporal-client) and [Worker Processes](/workers#worker-process) to Temporal Cloud is similar to connecting them to your own [Temporal Cluster](/clusters).
The primary difference is the requirement to provide client certificates and private keys.

- [Connect a Worker Process](/application-development/foundations#run-worker-processes)
