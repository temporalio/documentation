After you configure SAML with your IdP, we can finish the configuration on our side.
To do that, send the following information to us:

- The sign-in URL from your application
- The SAML sign-in certificate

When you receive confirmation from us that we have finished configuration, log in to Temporal Cloud.
This time, though, enter your email address in **Enterprise identity** and select **Continue**.
Do not select **Continue with Google** or **Continue with Microsoft**.
You will be redirected to the authentication page of your IdP.
