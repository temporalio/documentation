After you configure SAML with your IdP, we can finish the configuration on our side.
To do that, send the following information to us [via Zendesk? something else?]:
  - The sign-in URL from your application [obtained from where? specific to each IdP]
  - The SAML sign-in certificate using SHA256 [where from? any other requirements?]

When you receive confirmation from us that we have finished configuration, try to log in to Temporal Cloud.
This time, though, enter your email address in **Enterprise identity** instead of selecting **Continue with Google**.
You will be redirected to the authentication page of your IdP.
