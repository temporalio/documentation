All customers will automatically be upgraded to the latest minor version.

Maintenance support, for major versions, will be provided for at least 18 months after a GA release, and there will be at least 6 months' notice before EOL/deprecating support.

This versioning policy is intended to serve as a minimum set of guidelines for customers who rely on us for their critical business operations.
If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to reach out via community or customer channels.
