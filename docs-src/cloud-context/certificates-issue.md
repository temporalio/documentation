Temporal Cloud authenticates a client connection by validating the client certificate against one or more CA certificates that are configured for the specified Namespace.

### Option 1: You already have certificate management infrastructure

If you have existing certificate management infrastructure that supports issuing CA and end-entity certificates, it satisfies the requirements.
When you configure the client SDK, you need to present a complete certificate chain up to the CA certificate given to Temporal.

### Option 2: You don't have certificate management infrastructure

If you don't have an existing certificate management infrastructure, you can issue the CA and client certificates by using tools such as OpenSSL or open source tools like certstrap.

#### Option 2a: Use certstrap

[Certstrap](https://github.com/square/certstrap) is a popular and easy to use tool for issuing certificates.

Follow these steps to issue a certificate for use with Temporal Cloud:

1. Install certstrap by following the instructions in the [certstrap README](https://github.com/square/certstrap#getting-started).
2. Set the Namespace Name as the common name for the certificate:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS" default>

```command
export NAMESPACE_NAME=your-namespace
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```command
set NAMESPACE_NAME=your-namespace
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. Initialize a new certificate authority:

```command
./certstrap init --common-name "My Cert Auth"
```

4. Request a certificate with a common name equal to the Namespace Name:

```command
./certstrap request-cert --common-name ${NAMESPACE_NAME}
```

5. Sign the certificate request and generate the end-entity certificate:

```command
./certstrap sign ${NAMESPACE_NAME} --CA "My Cert Auth"
```

6. (optional) If you are using the Temporal Java SDK, you will need to convert the PKCS1 file format to PKCS8 file format.
   Export the certificate and private key to a PKCS8 file:

```command
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in <infile.key> -out <outfile.key> -nocrypt
```

You can now use the generated client certificate with Temporal Cloud.

#### Option 2b: Use Temporal's client certificate generation tool

We also provide a tool that issues one root CA and the required end-entity certificate to use on the client SDK.
The tool can issue multiple end-entity certificates.
We've kept this tool minimal because it is a demonstration tool; **it is _not_ meant to be used in production.**

You can use this tool in two ways:

- Follow the instructions for the [temporalio/client-certificate-generation](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/client-certificate-generation) image in Docker Hub.
  This procedure is the easiest because it's independent of your operating system.
- Follow the README instructions in the [client-only](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/main/tls/client-only) directory in our `temporalio/samples-server` repository in GitHub.

:::info

The maximum number of CA certificates in a certificate bundle is 16. The payload size of a certificate bundle (before base64-encoding) is 32 KB.
