To authenticate the users of your Temporal Cloud account, you can connect a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity provider (IdP).

If you want to use the general Microsoft login mechanism, you don't need to set up SAML with Azure AD. [add clarification?]

### How to integrate SAML with your Temporal Cloud account

1. Locate your Temporal Cloud Account Id.
   You will need the Account Id to construct your callback URL and your entity identifier. [add instructions]
1. Configure SAML with your IdP.
   - Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) [links to saml-how-to-configure-with-azure-ad]
   - Okta [links to saml-how-to-configure-with-okta]
1. Share your connection information with us and test your connection. [links to saml-finish]
