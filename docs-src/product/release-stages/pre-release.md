**Access:** Most Pre-release features are released in the open source Temporal software and are publicly available.
However, some features which are explicit to hosting Temporal Services, such as [API Keys](/cloud/api-keys/api-keys), may be specific to Temporal Cloud.

In Temporal Cloud, Pre-release features are invite-only: Temporal will work directly with a group of existing Temporal Cloud customers to be part of testing of each Pre-release feature.
These customers are invited to provide feedback to the Temporal team.

**Classification:** New features in Pre-release may not be fully mature and may have bugs.
Users acknowledge and agree that Pre-release features are provided on an “as-is” basis, and that they are provided without any indemnification, support, warranties, or representation of any kind.

**Feedback:** Feedback is highly encouraged and important for guiding Temporal feature development.
We encourage you to share your experience so that you can influence the future direction of Temporal.

**Availability:** Temporal may modify features before they become Generally Available, or may even decide to remove them.
This means there is no guarantee that a new feature will become Generally Available.
A Pre-release feature can be deprecated at any time.

Pre-release features may be disabled by default, and can be enabled via configuration.
Temporal Cloud customers can contact the Temporal account team or [Temporal Support Team](/cloud/support-create-ticket) to gain Pre-release access.
