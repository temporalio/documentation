**What are the officially supported SDKs?**

Each Temporal SDK targets a specific programming language.

- [Go SDK developer's guide](/go/chapter-introduction/introduction-to-go-sdk)
- [Java SDK developer's guide](/java/introduction-to-java-sdk)
- [PHP SDK developer's guide](/dev-guide/php)
- [Python SDK developer's guide](/python/introduction-to-python-sdk)
- [TypeScript developer's guide](/typescript/introduction-to-typescript-sdk)
- [.NET API reference](https://dotnet.temporal.io/)

Despite supporting multiple languages, and supporting many features, Temporal SDKs aim to make developers feel at home in their language.
