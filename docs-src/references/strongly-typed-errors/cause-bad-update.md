<!--TODO: add link to Workflow Update page when written -->

This error indicates that a [Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution) tried to complete before receiving an Update.

`BadUpdate` can happen when a [Worker](/concepts/what-is-a-worker) generates a [Workflow Task Completed](/references/events#WorkflowTaskCompleted) message with missing fields or an invalid Update response format.

This error might indicate usage of an unsupported SDK.
Make sure you're using a [supported SDK](/temporal#temporal-sdk).
