The Workflow has reached capacity for pending Signals.
Therefore, the [Workflow Task](/tasks#workflow-task) was failed after attempting to add more [Signals](/application-development/features/#signals) to an external Workflow.

Wait for Signals to be processed by the Workflow before retrying the Task.
