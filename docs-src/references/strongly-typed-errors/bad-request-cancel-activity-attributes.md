This error either indicates the possibility of unset attributes for `RequestCancelActivity`, or an invalid History Builder state.

Update the Temporal SDK to the most recent release.
Reset any unset attributes before retrying the Task.

If you continue to see this error, review your code for nondeterministic causes.
