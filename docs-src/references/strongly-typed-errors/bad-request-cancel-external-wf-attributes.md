This error indicates that the [Workflow Task](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-task) failed while trying to cancel an external Workflow.
Unset or invalid attributes can cause this to occur.

Reset any missing attributes, such as Workflow Id or Run Id.
Adjust any fields that exceed length limits.

If [Child Workflow](/concepts/what-is-a-child-workflow-execution) is set to `Start` and `RequestCancel`, remove one of these attributes.
A Child Workflow cannot perform both actions in the same Workflow Task.
