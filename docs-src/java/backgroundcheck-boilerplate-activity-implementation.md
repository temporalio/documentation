Now that you've defined your Activity Interface you can define its implementation.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/main/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl.java) in the context of the rest of the application code.

:::

```java
public class BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl implements BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivities{

  @Override
  public String ssnTraceActivity(String socialSecurityNumber){
    
    // This is where a call to another service would be made to perform the trace
    // We are simulating that the service that does SSNTrace executed successfully
    // with a passing value being returned

    String result = "pass";
    return result;
  }

}
```
