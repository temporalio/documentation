The list action lists all the available Schedules. This command is useful when you want to view a list of all the Schedules and their respective Schedule IDs.

To list all schedules, use the `listSchedules()` asynchronous method on the `ScheduleClient`.
If a schedule is added or deleted, it may not be available in the list immediately.

```java
Stream<ScheduleListDescription> scheduleStream = client.listSchedules();
```
