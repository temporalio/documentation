Temporal provides the `TestActivityEnvironment` and `TestActivityExtension` classes
to allow for testing Activities outside the scope of a Workflow. Testing
Activities is similar to testing non-Temporal java code.

Some examples of things an Activity can be tested for are:

- Exceptions thrown when invoking the Activity Execution.
- Exceptions thrown when checking for the result of the Activity Execution.
- Activity return values. Check to ensure the return value is expected.

This example asserts that the expected value was returned by the invocation of the Activity.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/test/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesTest.java) in the context of the rest of the application code.

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.RegisterExtension;
import io.temporal.testing.TestActivityExtension;



public class BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesTest {

  // Use JUnit Extensions to simplify the creation of the test environment.
  // This creates an environment and registers Activities to a Worker for testing.
  // If you would rather set this up yourself, look into TestActivityEnvironment
  @RegisterExtension
  public static final TestActivityExtension activityExtension = TestActivityExtension.newBuilder()
      .setActivityImplementations(new BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl()).build();

  // Test the Activity in isolation from the Workflow
  @Test
  public void testSsnTraceActivity(BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivities activities) {
    String socialSecurityNumber = "111-22-3333";

    // Run the Activity in the test environment
    String result = activities.ssnTraceActivity(socialSecurityNumber);

    // Check for the expected return value
    assertEquals("pass", result);
  }

}
```
