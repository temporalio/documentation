**How to add a Testing Framework and Tests for Workflows.**

We can test Workflow code for the following conditions:

- Workflow status. For example, did the Workflow reach a completed status?
- Workflow threw an exception. Did the Workflow function return an error?
- Error when checking for a result of a Workflow. Is there an error in getting the result returned by the Workflow?
- Workflow return value. If the Workflow did return something other than an error, is it what you expected it to be?

We can also perform a Workflow Replay test, and we'll provide detailed coverage of this topic in another section.
This creates an environment and registers the Workflow to a Worker for testing.
If you would rather set this up yourself, look into TestWorkflowEnvironment

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
