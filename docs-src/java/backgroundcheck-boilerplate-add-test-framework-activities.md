 ** How to add a Testing Framework and Tests Testing Activities.**

We can test Activity code for the following conditions:
- Exceptions thrown when invoking the Activity Execution.
- Exceptions thrown when checking for the result of the Activity Execution.
- Activity return values. Check to ensure the return value is expected.

This example asserts that the expected value was returned by the invocation of the Activity.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/backgroundcheck-boilerplate/backgroundcheck/src/test/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesTest.java) in the context of the rest of the application code.

```java

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.RegisterExtension;
import io.temporal.testing.TestActivityExtension;



public class BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesTest {

  // Use JUnit Extensions to simplify the creation of the test environment.
  // This creates an environment and registers Activities to a Worker for testing.
  // If you would rather set this up yourself, look into TestActivityEnvironment
  @RegisterExtension
  public static final TestActivityExtension activityExtension = TestActivityExtension.newBuilder()
      .setActivityImplementations(new BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl()).build();
```
