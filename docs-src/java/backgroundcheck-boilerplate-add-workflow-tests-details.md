As for the code, first you register your Workflow with the `TestWorkflowExtension`.
This extension allows you to pass in a `TestWorklowEnvironment`, `Worker`, and
an instance of your Workflow into your tests. To test your Workflow using mocked
activities you then create a mocked object of your Activity class to be used for
testing. Then you mock the Activity method, in this case `ssNTraceAcvitity`, so
that when when a specific value is passed to the Activity it returns a specific result.
Then the mocked object is used to register the mocked Activities with the Worker
being used in the test environment. Then you start the test environment, invoke
your Workflow as usual, passing in the specific value for your Activity so that
the Activity returns the result you are expecting. Then you assert that the
results are what you expected.

Doiong this allows you to test the Workflow code without having to worry
about actually invoking the Activity.
