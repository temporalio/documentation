A [Temporal Client](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the [Temporal Cluster](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster).
Communication with a Temporal Cluster includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.

:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.

:::

When you are running a Cluster locally (such as [Temporalite](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#temporalite)), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.
Many SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and [Docker Compose](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#docker-compose) serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).

To initialize a Workflow Client, create an instance of a `WorkflowClient`, create a client-side `WorkflowStub`, and then call a Workflow method (annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`).

To start a Workflow Execution, your Temporal Server must be running, and your front-end service must be accepting gRPC calls.

To establish a connection with the front-end service, use `WorkflowServiceStubs`.

```java
WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
```

You can provide `WorkflowServiceStubsOptions` to override the default values for the gRPC calls.

For example, the default front-end service gRPC address is set to `127.0.0.1:7233`, where `7233` is the default port for the Temporal Frontend Service.

If your server is running on a different host or port from the default, you can set it as shown in the following example.

```java
WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newInstance(
                    WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder()
                     .setTarget(TARGET_ENDPOINT)
                            .build());
```

After the connection to the Temporal Frontend Service is established, create a Client for the service stub.
The Workflow Client helps with client-side APIs and is required by Workers.

Create an instance of a `WorkflowClient` for the Workflow service stub, and use `WorkflowClientOptions` to set options for the Workflow Client.
The following example shows how to create a `WorkflowClient` instance called "client" for the `WorkflowServiceStubs` "service" that we created in the previous example, and set `Namespace` option for the `WorkflowClient`.

```java
WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(
                service,
                WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setNamespace(“Abc”)
                    .build());
```

For more information, see [WorkflowClientOptions](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClientOptions.Builder.html).

`WorkflowService` and `WorkflowClient` creation is a heavyweight operation, and will be resource-intensive if created each time you start a Workflow or send a Signal to it.
The recommended way is to create them once and reuse where possible.

With the Client defined, you can start interacting with the Temporal Frontend Service.

To initialize a Workflow in the Client, create a `WorkflowStub`, and start the Workflow Execution with `WorkflowClient.start()`.
Starting Workflows or sending Signals or Queries to Workflows from within a Client must be done using `WorkflowStubs`.

```java
WorkflowClient workflowClient =  WorkflowClient.newInstance(service, clientOptions);
 // Create a Workflow stub.
 YourWorkflow workflow = workflowClient.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class);
 // Start Workflow asynchronously and call its "yourWFMethod" Workflow method
 WorkflowClient.start(workflow::yourWFMethod);
```
