Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when [starting the Workflow Execution](/java/workflow-timeouts).

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout)** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-run-timeout)**: restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-task-timeout)**: restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.
