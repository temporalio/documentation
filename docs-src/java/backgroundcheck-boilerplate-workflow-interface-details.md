To designate an interface as a Workflow, annotate the interface declaration
with `@WorkflowInterface`. Then designate a method within the interface
as the Workflow Method by annotating its method signature with `@WorkflowMethod`.
The Workflow Method is the method that will be invoked when executing a Workflow.
There can only be one Workflow Method per Workflow Definition.
