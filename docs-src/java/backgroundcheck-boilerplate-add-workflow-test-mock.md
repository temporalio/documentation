code and only testing the Workflow code, use Mocking.

This example demonstrates how to use Mockito to mock an Activity and have
your Workflow invoke the mocked Activity.
This creates an environment and registers the Workflow to a Worker for testing.
If you would rather set this up yourself, look into TestWorkflowEnvironment
This will execute your Workflow, calling the Mocked Activities in place
of your actual implementation of the Activities.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/backgroundcheck-boilerplate/backgroundcheck/src/test/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowTest.java) in the context of the rest of the application code.

:::

```java
public class BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowTest {

  @RegisterExtension
  public static final TestWorkflowExtension testWorkflowExtension = TestWorkflowExtension
      .newBuilder().setWorkflowTypes(BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowImpl.class)
      .setDoNotStart(true).build();

  @Test
  public void testSuccessfulBackgroundCheckBoilerplateWithMocks(TestWorkflowEnvironment testEnv,
      Worker worker, BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow workflow) {
    
    // Create a mock object of your Activities
    BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivities mockedActivities =
        mock(BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivities.class, withSettings().withoutAnnotations());

    when(mockedActivities.ssnTraceActivity("Angela")).thenReturn("pass");

    // Register the Workflow's Activities with the Worker provided by the Extension
    worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(mockedActivities);

    // Start the test environment
    testEnv.start();


    String pass_output = workflow.backgroundCheck("Angela");
  
    assertEquals("pass", pass_output);
  
  }
}
```
