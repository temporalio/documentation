Temporal provides the `TestWorkflowEnvironment` and `TestWorkflowExtension` classes
to allow for testing Workflows. There are two ways to test Workflows; the first
is to test the Workflow code without invoking the real Activities by mocking
the Workflow's Activities and the second is to test the Workflow and its Activities
in their entirety. This section will focus on the second scenario while a previous
section will cover the first.

As for the actual testing code, testing Workflows is similar to testing non-Temporal java code.

Some examples of things an Workflow can be tested for are:

- Exceptions thrown when invoking the Workflow Execution.
- Exceptions thrown when checking for the result of the Workflow Execution.
- Workflow return values. Check to ensure the return value is expected.

We can also perform a Workflow Replay test, and we'll provide detailed coverage of this topic in another section.
