Referred to as "intrinsic non-determinism" this kind of "bad" Workflow code can prevent the Workflow code from completing because the Workflow can take a different code path than the one expected from the Event History.

The following are some common operations that **can't** be done inside of a Workflow Definition:

- Generate and rely on random numbers (Use Activites instead).
- Accessing / mutating external systems or state.
  This includes calling an external API, conducting a file I/O operation, talking to another service, etc. (use Activities instead).
- Relying on system time.
  - Use `Workflow.currentTimeMillis()` as a replacement for `System.CurrentTimeMillis()`.
  - Use `Workflow.Sleep()` as a replacement for `Thread.Sleep()`.
- Working directly with threads.
- Iterating over data structures with unknown ordering.
  This includes iterating over HashMaps using `for` as the order is randomized.
  Instead you can collect the keys of the map, sort them, and then iterate over the sorted keys to access the map or consider using a `LinkedHashMap` or other ordered data structure.
  This technique provides deterministic results.
- Storing or evaluating the run Id.

One way to produce a non-deterministic error is to use a random number to determine whether to sleep inside the Workflow.
