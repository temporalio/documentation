When specifying the Temporal Cloud Namespace, make sure to append the Account Id 
as it appears in the url of the Cloud UI.

Consider the following Namespace url: https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces/backgroundcheck-app.1a23b/workflows, 
if your Namespace is "backgroundcheck-app" and your Account Id is "1a23b", then 
you would specify your Namespace as "backgroundcheck-app.1a23b".

The Temporal Cloud gRPC connection address includes your 
[Namesapce](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace) and a port number: `<Namespace>.<AccountId>.tmprl.cloud:<port>`.
For example: `https://backgroundcheck-app.1a23b.tmprl.cloud:1234`.
There is an option to copy the grPC endpoint address from the Temporal Cloud UI.
