Now that you've defined your Activity Interface you can define its implementation.

<div class="copycode-notice-container"><div class="copycode-notice"><img data-style="copycode-icon" src="/icons/copycode.png" alt="Copy code icon" /> Sample application code information <img id="i-id-1762068568" data-event="clickable-copycode-info" data-style="chevron-icon" src="/icons/chevron.png" alt="Chevron icon" /></div><div id="copycode-info-id-1762068568" class="copycode-info">The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application. The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.

```java
public class BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl implements BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivities{

  @Override
  public String ssnTraceActivity(String socialSecurityNumber){
    
    // This is where a call to another service would be made to perform the trace
    // We are simulating that the service that does SSNTrace executed successfully
    // with a passing value being returned

    String result = "pass";
    return result;
  }

}
```
