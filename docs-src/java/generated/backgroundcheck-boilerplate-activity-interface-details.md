To designate an interface as a Activity, annotate the interface declaration
with `@ActivityInterface`. Then designate a method within the interface
as the Activity Method by annotating its method signature with `@ActivityMethod`.
The Activity Method is the method that will be invoked when executing a specificy
Activity. There can multiple Activity Methods per Activity Definition.
