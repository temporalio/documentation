To connect to Temporal Cloud, you need mTLS credentials. mTLS stands for "mutual Transport Layer Security." mTLS is a security protocol that creates a secure connection between a client and a server. It's built on the widely adopted TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol, and add an additional layer of authentication.

In these steps, you create an x509 mTLS Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and its mTLS private key.

:::warning

Credentials are sensitive information.
Always follow your organization's best practices for storing and accessing your secure configuration files and cryptographic keys.

:::

## Generate Credentials

Generate your mTLS credentials with the 'tcld' command line utility.
Issue the following command to build your key certificates.
You will need a meaningful IDENTIFIER and a PAIRNAME to describe the pem/key pair you generate.

```
$ tcld generate-certificates \
    certificate-authority-certificate \
    --organization "[IDENTIFIER]" \
    --validity-period [PERIOD-OF-VALIDITY] \
    --ca-certificate-file /path/to/[PAIRNAME].pem \
    --ca-key-file /path/to/[PAIRNAME].key
```

Use any organizational name you feel suitable.
For example, "Temporal Education Team".
For individuals acting within a team, you might append their names.
Name the files as you wish and set a validity period as desired.

For example,

```
tcld generate-certificates \
    certificate-authority-certificate \
    --organization "Temporal Education Team - Erica Sadun" \
    --validity-period 90d \
    --ca-certificate-file edu.pem \
    --ca-key-file edu.key
```

The 'tcld' utility will ask you to confirm credential creation.

```
storing the certificate authority (private) key at edu.key, do not share this key with anyone. confirm: [y/n] y
certificate authority generated at: edu.pem
certificate authority key generated at: edu.key
```

## Upload Your Certificate to Temporal Cloud

Next, you add your new certificate to Temporal Cloud with 'tcld'. Use the Namespace Id you noted earlier, or retrieve it again from the Temporal Cloud Website.

```
$ tcld namespace accepted-client-ca add \
    --namespace "<your_namespace_id>"
    --ca-certificate-file /path/to/your/x509/certificate.pem
```

'tcld' returns JSON showing your in-progress request to update your Namespace.

```
{
	"requestStatus": {
		"requestId": "baf5ffb9-dda3-480c-becd-4dc063341e2e",
		"state": "InProgress",
		"checkDuration": "10s",
		"operationType": "UpdateNamespace",
		"resourceId": "<your_namespace_id>",
		"resourceType": "namespace",
		"failureReason": "",
		"startTime": "2024-03-01T20:53:00Z",
		"finishTime": null
	}
}
$
```

Wait a short period of time to allow the request to complete.
Finally, confirm that your certificate has been uploaded.

```
$ tcld namespace accepted-client-ca list \
    --namespace "<your_namespace_id>" | \
	grep [YOUR UNIQUE ORGANIZATION OR SUBSTRING]
```

For example:

```
tcld namespace accepted-client-ca list \
    --namespace "$MY_NAMESPACE" | \
    grep "Erica Sadun"
```

If you encounter a "request not authenticated" error, make sure to log in again with tcld login. Otherwise, congratulations! You're ready to start using Temporal Cloud.
