Temporal provides the `TestWorkflowEnvironment` and `TestWorkflowExtension` classes
to allow for testing Workflows. There are two ways to test Workflows; the first
is to test the Workflow code without invoking the real Activities by mocking
the Workflow's Activities and the second is to test the Workflow and its Activities
in their entirety. This section will focus on the second scenario while a previous
section will cover the first.

As for the actual testing code, testing Workflows is similar to testing non-Temporal java code.

Some examples of things an Workflow can be tested for are:

- Exceptions thrown when invoking the Workflow Execution.
- Exceptions thrown when checking for the result of the Workflow Execution.
- Workflow return values. Check to ensure the return value is expected.

We can also perform a Workflow Replay test, and we'll provide detailed coverage of this topic in another section.

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/test/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowIntegrationTest.java) in the context of the rest of the application code.

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.RegisterExtension;
import io.temporal.testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment;
import io.temporal.testing.TestWorkflowExtension;
import io.temporal.worker.Worker;



public class BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowIntegrationTest {

  // Use JUnit Extensions to simplify the creation of the test environment.
  // This creates an environment and registers the Workflow to a Worker for testing.
  // If you would rather set this up yourself, look into TestWorkflowEnvironment
  @RegisterExtension
  public static final TestWorkflowExtension testWorkflowExtension = TestWorkflowExtension
      .newBuilder().setWorkflowTypes(BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowImpl.class).setDoNotStart(true).build();

  @Test
  public void testSuccessfulBackgroundCheckBoilerplate(TestWorkflowEnvironment testEnv, Worker worker,
      BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow workflow) {

    // Register the Workflow's Activities with the Worker provided by the Extension
    worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl());

    // Start the test environment
    testEnv.start();

    // Request execution of the backgroundCheck Workflow
    // This will execute your entire Workflow, along with every Activity the
    // Workflow calls
    String output = workflow.backgroundCheck("555-22-3333");

    // Check for the expected return value
    assertEquals("pass", output);
  }
}
