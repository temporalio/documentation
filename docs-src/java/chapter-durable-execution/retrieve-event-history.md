There are a few ways to view and download a Workflow Execution's [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history).
We recommend starting off by using either the Temporal CLI or the Web UI to access it.

### Using the Temporal CLI

Use the Temporal CLI's `temporal workflow show` command to save your Workflow Execution's Event History to a local file.
Run the command from the `/backgroundcheckreplay` directory so that the file is available to the testing files.

```text
/backgroundcheck
    ...
    /main
    /test
    backgroundcheck_workflow_history.json
```

**Local dev server**

If you have been following along with the earlier chapters of this guide, your Workflow Id might be something like `backgroundcheck_workflow`.

```shell
temporal workflow show \
 --workflow-id backgroundcheck_workflow \
 --output json > backgroundcheck_workflow_event_history.json
```

:::info Workflow Id returns the most recent Workflow Execution

The most recent Event History for that Workflow Id is returned when you only use the Workflow Id to identify the Workflow Execution.
Use the `--run-id` option as well to get the Event History of an earlier Workflow Execution by the same Workflow Id.

**Temporal Cloud**

For Temporal Cloud, remember to either provide the paths to your certificate and private keys as command options, or set those paths as environment variables:

```shell
temporal workflow show \
 --workflow-id backgroundcheck_workflow \
 --namespace backgroundcheck_namespace \
 --tls-cert-path /path/to/ca.pem \
 --tls-key-path /path/to/ca.key \
 --output json  > backgroundcheck_workflow_history.json
```

**Self-hosted Temporal Cluster**

For self-hosted environments, you might be using the Temporal CLI command alias:

```shell
temporal_docker workflow show \
 --workflow-id backgroundcheck_workflow \
 --namespace backgroundcheck_namespace \
 --output json  > backgroundcheck_workflow_history.json
```

### Via the UI

A Workflow Execution's Event History is also available in the Web UI.

Navigate to the Workflows page in the UI and select the Workflow Execution.

From the Workflow details page you can copy the Event History from the JSON tab and paste it into the `backgroundcheck_workflow_history.json` file.
