To run a Worker Process with a local development server, define the following steps in code:

- Generate the gRPC stubs necessary to configure a connection to a Temporal Cluster running on localhost using the 'default' namespace
- Initialize a Temporal Client (`WorkflowClient`), passing in the gRPC stubs.
- Initialize a WorkerFactory, passing in the Temporal Client (`WorkflowClient`)
- Create a new Worker using the WorkerFactory, passing in the task queue the Worker should listen on.
- Register the application's Workflow and Activities.
- Call start on the Worker.

Temporal recommends keeping Worker code separate from Workflow and Activity code.

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.

```java
import backgroundcheckboilerplate.BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl;
import backgroundcheckboilerplate.BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowImpl;
import io.temporal.client.WorkflowClient;
import io.temporal.serviceclient.WorkflowServiceStubs;
import io.temporal.worker.Worker;
import io.temporal.worker.WorkerFactory;


public class DevServerWorker {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Generate the gRPC stubs
    WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();

    // Initialize the Temporal Client, passing in the gRPC stubs
    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);

    // Initialize a WorkerFactory, passing in the Temporal Client (WorkflowClient)
    WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);

    // Create a new Worker
    Worker worker = factory.newWorker("backgroundcheck-tasks");

    // Register the Workflow by passing in the class to the worker
    worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowImpl.class);

    // Register the Activities by passing in an Activities object used for execution
    worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl());

    // Start the Worker
    factory.start();
  }
}
```
