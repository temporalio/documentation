Most SDKs provide a [`PayloadConverter`](/concepts/what-is-a-payload-converter) that can be customized to convert custom data types to bytes and back.

Note that creating a custom Payload Converter is optional, and only needed if the default Data Converter does not support your custom values.

Create your [custom `PayloadConverter`](/concepts/what-is-a-payload-converter#custom-payload-conversion) and set it with the default `DataConverter` in your Client options.

The order in which your Payload Converters are applied depend on the encoding type that each handles. You can set multiple custom payload converters to run your conversions.
