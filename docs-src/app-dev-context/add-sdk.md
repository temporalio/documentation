A [Temporal SDK](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-sdk) provides a framework for [Temporal Application](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-application) development.

An SDK provides you with the following:

- A [Temporal Client](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-client) to communicate with a [Temporal Cluster](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster).
- APIs to develop [Workflows](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow).
- APIs to create and manage [Worker Processes](/concepts/what-is-a-worker).
- APIs to author [Activities](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-definition).
