The following code example creates a new Workflow and sets the Workflow Id.
Then it sets the Workflow Id Reuse Policy and the Workflow Execution Timeout to 2 minutes.

```php
$workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    DynamicSleepWorkflowInterface::class,
    WorkflowOptions::new()
        ->withWorkflowId(DynamicSleepWorkflow::WORKFLOW_ID)
        ->withWorkflowIdReusePolicy(WorkflowIdReusePolicy::WORKFLOW_ID_REUSE_POLICY_ALLOW_DUPLICATE)
        ->withWorkflowExecutionTimeout(CarbonInterval::minutes(2))
);
```
