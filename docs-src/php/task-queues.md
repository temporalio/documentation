The majority of this information has moved into the [Developer's guide](/application-development/?lang=php).

However, if you can't find what you are looking for there, we recommend checking this doc set as well.

In PHP, a Task Queue is represented in code by its name as a `string`.
There are four places where the name of the Task Queue is supplied by the developer.

1. When starting a Workflow, a Task Queue name must be provided in the `StartWorkflowOptions`.

```php
// Create new Workflow Options and set the Task Queue
$workflowOptions = WorkflowOptions::new()
  ->withTaskQueue("Workflow-Task-Queue-1")
  // ...

$yourWorkflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
  YourWorkflowInterface::class,
  $workflowOptions
);

$result = $yourWorkflow->workflowMethod();
```

2. A Task Queue name must be provided as a parameter when creating a Worker.

```php
use Temporal\WorkerFactory;

// Create a Worker Factory
$factory = WorkerFactory::create();

// Set the Task Queue when creating the Worker
$worker = $factory->newWorker("Workflow-Task-Queue-1");

// Workflows are stateful. So you need a type to create instances.
$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(YourWorkflow::class);

// start primary loop
$factory->run();
```

A single Worker can listen to only one Task Queue.
And, it is important to remember that the name of the Task Queue the Worker is listening to must match the name of the Task Queue provided in the options to any given Workflow or Activity.

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it will fail that Task.
However, the failure of the Task will not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

3. Optionally, the name of a Task Queue can be provided in the `ActivityOptions` when calling an Activity from a Workflow.

```php
class YourWorkflow implements YourWorkflowInterface
{
  private $yourActivity;

  public function __construct()
  {
    // Create Activity options and set the Task Queue
    $activityOptions = ActivityOptions::new()
      ->withTaskQueue("Activity-Task-Queue-1")
      // ...

    // Create a new Activity Stub and pass the options
    $this->yourActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
      YourActivityInterface::class,
      $activityOptions
    );
  }

  public function workflowMethod(): \Generator
  {
    // Call the Activity
    return yield $this->yourActivity->activityMethod();
  }
}
```

If a Task Queue name is not provided in the `ActivityOptions`, then the Activity Tasks are placed in the same Task Queue as the Workflow Task Queue.

4. Optionally, the name of a Task Queue can be provided in the `ChildWorkflowOptions` when calling a Child Workflow.

```php
//Create new Child Workflow Options and set the Task Queue
$childWorkflowOptions = ChildWorkflowOptions::new()
    ->withTaskQueue("Child-Workflow-Task-Queue-1")
    // ...

// Create a new Child Workflow Stub and set the Task Queue
$childWorkflow = Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub(
    ChildWorkflowInterface::class,
    $childWorkflowOptions
);

// Call the Child Workflow method
$promise = $childWorkflow->workflowMethod();
```

If a Task Queue name is not provided in the `ChildWorkflowOptions`, then the Child Workflow Tasks are placed in the same Task Queue as the Parent Workflow Task Queue.
