A Retry Policy can be configured with an instance of the `RetryOptions` object.
To enable retries for a Workflow, you need to provide a Retry Policy object via `ChildWorkflowOptions` for Child Workflows or via `WorkflowOptions` for top-level Workflows.

```php
$workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
      CronWorkflowInterface::class,
      WorkflowOptions::new()->withRetryOptions(
        RetryOptions::new()->withInitialInterval(120)
      )
);
```

For more detailed information about `RetryOptions` object see [retries](/php/retries) for more details.
