Each Temporal SDK provides a [Data Converter](/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter) that can be customized with a custom [Payload Codec](/concepts/what-is-a-payload-codec) to encode and secure your data.

For details on what data can be encoded, how to secure it, and what to consider when using encryption, see [Data encryption](/prod-readiness-context/data-encryption).

You can use a [Codec Server](/concepts/what-is-a-codec-server) with your custom Payload Codec to decode the data you see on your Web UI and CLI locally through remote endpoints.
However, ensure that you consider all security implications of [remote data encoding](/concepts/what-is-remote-data-encoding) before using a Codec Server.
