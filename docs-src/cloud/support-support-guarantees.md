Temporal endeavors to ensure you are successful with Temporal Cloud. We offer explicit guarantees for support.
Temporal Cloud customers get break/fix support with an agreed-upon set of SLAs for prioritized issues.
We use a ticketing system for entering, tracking, and closing these issues.

If an issue occurs, the team also provides support through a dedicated Slack channel, forums, and a knowledge base.
We offer two levels of support defined by their availability and SLAs in the following table.

|                    | Basic Support                                                                                  | Premium Support                                                                           |
