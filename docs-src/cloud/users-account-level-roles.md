When a Global Admin invites a user to join an account, the Global Admin selects one of the following Roles for that user:

- **Global Admin**
  - Has full administrative permissions across the account, including users and usage
  - Has Namespace Admin [permissions](/cloud/users-namespace-level-permissions) on all [Namespaces](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace) in the account
- **Developer**
  - Can create and update Namespaces; has full control over [Workflows](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow)
  - Has Namespace Admin permissions for each Namespace created by that user
- **Read-Only:** Can only read information
