Temporal Cloud employs a consumption-based pricing model that's based on storage and execution, factors that vary from one Workflow to the next. You can estimate the cost of a specific Workflow by running it at a low volume and then using its storage and compute measurements to project your production-scale cost. Our team is happy to [help you estimate the cost](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us) for your specific workloads.
