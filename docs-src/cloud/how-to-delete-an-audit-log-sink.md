When you no longer need Audit Logging, you can delete the Audit Log sink.

1. In the Temporal Cloud UI, select **Settings**.
1. On the **Settings** page, select **Integrations**.
1. In the **Audit Logging** card, select **Configure Audit Logs**.
1. At the bottom of the **Audit Logging** page, choose **Delete**.

After you confirm the deletion, the Audit Log Sink is removed from your account and logs stop flowing to your Kinesis stream.
