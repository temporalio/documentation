Connecting your [Temporal Clients](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-client) and [Worker Processes](/concepts/what-is-a-worker-process) to Temporal Cloud is similar to connecting them to your own [Temporal Cluster](/clusters).
The primary difference is the requirement to provide client certificates and private keys.
