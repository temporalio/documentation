Audit Logging supports the [Amazon Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) streaming-data platform.
By using [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html), you can route Temporal Audit Logs in [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/) (S3).
We plan to release additional integrations.
