**Where is Temporal Cloud available?**

Developers and applications can access Temporal Cloud from any location with internet connectivity, irrespective of where the Temporal Cloud resources (Namespaces) are located.

Temporal Cloud is compatible with applications deployed in various cloud environments or data centers.

To minimize latency, we advise creating your Namespace in a region geographically close to your Workers' hosting location.

Currently, Temporal Cloud operates in several regions on Amazon Web Services (AWS):

| Area          | Code           | Region            |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Asia Pacific  | ap-northeast-1 | Tokyo             |
| Asia Pacific  | ap-northeast-2 | Seoul             |
| Asia Pacific  | ap-south-1     | Mumbai            |
| Asia Pacific  | ap-southeast-1 | Singapore         |
| Asia Pacific  | ap-southeast-2 | Sydney            |
| Europe        | eu-central-1   | Frankfurt         |
