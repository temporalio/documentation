Audit Logging is a feature of [Temporal Cloud](/concepts/what-is-temporal-cloud) that provides forensic access information at the account level, the user level, and the [Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace) level.

Audit Logging answers "who, when, and what" questions about Temporal Cloud resources.
These answers can help you evaluate the security of your organization, and they can provide information that you need to satisfy audit and compliance requirements.
