- **Keep it Secret | Key it Safe**: Treat your API Key as you would a password. Don't expose it in client-side code, public repositories, or other easily accessible places.
- **Rotate Regularly**: Change your API Keys periodically to minimize potential harm from any leaks.
- **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on the usage metrics and logs. If you notice unexpected or unauthorized activity, revoke the key immediately.
- **KMS**: Use a KMS to reduce risks of key leak.
