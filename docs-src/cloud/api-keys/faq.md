**Q: Can I have multiple API Keys?**

A: Yes, you can generate multiple keys to use in different services or for team members.

**Q: How many API Keys can I have?**

A: 10 per User.

**Q: Is there an expiration for the API Keys?**

A: Yes. During Preview, API Keys have an upper bound of 90 days. In a subsequent release, long-lived API Keys will become available. Temporal recommends rotating API Keys periodically.

**Q: What should I do if I lost my API Key secret?**

A: For security reasons, we only display the full key once upon creation. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.
