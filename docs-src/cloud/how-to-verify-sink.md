**How to verify the Sink**

From the Export configuration page, select **Verify** to verify that a test file can be written to the sink successfully.

You will see a status of `Success` if everything is configured correctly and Temporal can write to your sink.

We recommend trying this step before saving, to surface any configuration errors earlier.
