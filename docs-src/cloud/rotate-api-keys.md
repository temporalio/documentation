**How to rotate API Keys**

Rotating API Keys is a good practice. Because API Keys are immutable, they cannot change once created, rotating an API Key means creating a new key and then deleting the old one.

To rotate an API Key

1. Create a new key to replace the old key
   1. API Keys can share the same name
2. Securely save the new keyâ€™s secret
3. Replace the expiring key with the new key and secret
