The Audit Logging page of the Temporal Cloud UI provides the current status of an Audit Log sink.

- If an error is detected, a summary of the error appears below the page title.
- If the Audit Log sink is functioning normally, an **On** badge appears next to the page heading.

After an Admin Operation is performed, users can see Audit Log messages flow through Kinesis.

Temporal retains Audit Log information for up to 30 days.
If you experience an issue with an Audit Log sink, we can provide the missing audit information.
