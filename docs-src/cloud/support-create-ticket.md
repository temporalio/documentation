You must have a [Zendesk account](#zendesk-account) with the same domain name as your Temporal Cloud account to create a ticket in Zendesk.

This procedure applies only to Temporal Cloud customers whose contracts include paid support.
If you need assistance and don't have paid support, post your request in the [Temporal Community Forum](https://community.temporal.io) or the `#support-cloud` channel of the [Temporal workspace](https://t.mp/slack) in Slack.
