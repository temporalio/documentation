Temporal Cloud is a consumption-based service; you pay only for what you need when you need it. Our [pricing](https://temporal.io/pricing) derives from your use of _actions_, _storage_, and _support_. Pricing is flexible, transparent, and predictable, so you know your costs and never pay for unused capacity.

This page introduces the elements of Temporal Cloud pricing so that you can estimate costs for your implementation. To gain a reliable estimate, [contact our team](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us).
