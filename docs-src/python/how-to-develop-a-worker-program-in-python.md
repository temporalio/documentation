To develop a Worker, use the `Worker()` constructor and add your Client, Task Queue, Workflows, and Activities as arguments.
The following code example creates a Worker that polls for tasks from the Task Queue and executes the Workflow.
When a Worker is created, it accepts a list of Workflows in the workflows parameter, a list of Activities in the activities parameter, or both.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/run_worker_dacx.py) in the context of the rest of the application code.

:::

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.worker import Worker
# ...
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    worker = Worker(
        client,
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        workflows=[YourWorkflow],
        activities=[your_activity],
    )
    await worker.run()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
