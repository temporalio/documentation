Similar to dynamic Workflows, an Activity can be made dynamic by adding `dynamic=True` to the `@activity.defn` decorator.
The Activity function must then accept a single argument of type `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`.

At runtime, the Activity will be invoked if no Activity with the given name is registered.
The input arguments are passed to the Activity function as the single `Sequence[RawValue]` argument.

```python
# ...
@activity.defn(dynamic=True)
async def compose_greeting(args: Sequence[RawValue]) -> str:
    return f"{args}!"
# ...
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, args: Sequence[RawValue]) -> str:
        name = args[0].payload
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            "unregistered_activity_name",
            name,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```
