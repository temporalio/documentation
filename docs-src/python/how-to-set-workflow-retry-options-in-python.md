Set the Retry Policy to either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.

```python
# ...
    handle = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your retry policy argument",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=2)),
    )
```
