Workflows listen for Signals by the Signal's name.

To send a Signal to the Workflow, use the [signal](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#signal) method from the [WorkflowHandle](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html) class.

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
# ...
# ...
    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.submit_greeting, "User 1")
```
