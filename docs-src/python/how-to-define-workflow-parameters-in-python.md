Workflow parameters are the method parameters of the singular method decorated with `@workflow.run`.
These can be any data type Temporal can convert, including [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) when properly type-annotated.
Technically this can be multiple parameters, but Temporal strongly encourages a single `dataclass` parameter containing all input fields.

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
# ...
# ...
@dataclass
class YourParams:
    greeting: str
    name: str
```
