To list all schedules, use the [list_schedules()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#list_schedules) asynchronous method on the Client.
If a schedule is added or deleted, it may not be available in the list immediately.

```python
# ...
async def main() -> None:
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    async for schedule in await client.list_schedules():
        print(f"List Schedule Info: {schedule.info}.")
```
