To Backfill a Scheduled Workflow Execution in Python, use the [backfill()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.ScheduleHandle.html#backfill) asynchronous
method on the Schedule Handle.

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = client.get_schedule_handle(
        "workflow-schedule-id",
    )
    now = datetime.utcnow()
    await handle.backfill(
        ScheduleBackfill(
            start_at=now - timedelta(minutes=10),
            end_at=now - timedelta(minutes=9),
            overlap=ScheduleOverlapPolicy.ALLOW_ALL,
        ),
    ),
