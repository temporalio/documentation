To run a Worker Process with a local development server, define the following steps in code:

- Initialize a Temporal Client.
- Create a new Worker by passing the Client to creation call.
- Register the application's Workflow and Activity functions.
- Call run on the Worker.

In regards to organization, we recommend keeping Worker code separate from Workflow and Activity code.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/backgroundcheck_boilerplate/dev_server_worker/main_dacx.py) in the context of the rest of the application code.

:::

```python
import asyncio

from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.worker import Worker

from activities.ssntraceactivity_dacx import ssn_trace_activity
from workflows.backgroundcheck_dacx import BackgroundCheck



async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")

    worker = Worker(
        client,
        task_queue="background-check-boilerplate-task-queue",
        workflows=[BackgroundCheck],
        activities=[ssn_trace_activity],
    )

    await worker.run()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
