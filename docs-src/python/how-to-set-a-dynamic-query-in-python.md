A Dynamic Query in Temporal is a Query that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Query with the same name is registered.
A Query can be made dynamic by adding `dynamic=True` to the `@query.defn` decorator.

The Query Handler should accept `self`, a string name, and a `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`.
The [payload_converter()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#payload_converter) function is used to convert a `RawValue` object to the desired type.
