You can set each Workflow to repeat on a schedule with the `cron_schedule` option from either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

    result = await client.execute_workflow(
        CronWorkflow.run,
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        cron_schedule="* * * * *",
