title: How to develop an Activity Definition in Python
sidebar_label: Activity Definition
description: In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity Definition is an exportable function or a struct method.
---

You can develop an Activity Definition by using the `@activity.defn` decorator.
Register the function as an Activity with a custom name through a decorator argument, for example `@activity.defn(name="your_activity")`.
