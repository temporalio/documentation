The Foundations section of the Temporal Developer's guide covers the minimum set of concepts and implementation details needed to build and run a [Temporal Application](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-application)—that is, all the relevant steps to start a [Workflow Execution](#develop-workflows) that executes an [Activity](#develop-activities).

In this section you can find the following:

- [Run a development Cluster](/clusters/how-to-install-temporal-cli)
- [Install your SDK](/python/add-sdk)
- [Connect to a dev Cluster](/python/connect-to-a-dev-cluster)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](/python/connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Develop a Workflow](/python/developing-workflows)
- [Develop an Activity](/python/developing-activities)
- [Start an Activity Execution](/python/spawning-activities)
- [Run a dev Worker](/python/run-a-dev-worker)
- [Run a Temporal Cloud Worker](/python/run-a-dev-worker)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](/python/spawning-workflows)
