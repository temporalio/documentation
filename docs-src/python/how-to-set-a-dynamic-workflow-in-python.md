A Dynamic Workflow in Temporal is a Workflow that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Workflow with the same name is registered.
A Workflow can be made dynamic by adding `dynamic=True` to the `@workflow.defn` decorator.
You must register the Workflow with the [Worker](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.html) before it can be invoked.

The Workflow Definition must then accept a single argument of type `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`.
The [payload_converter()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#payload_converter) function is used to convert a `RawValue` object to the desired type.

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn(dynamic=True)
class DynamicWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, args: Sequence[RawValue]) -> str:
        name = workflow.payload_converter().from_payload(args[0].payload, str)
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            default_greeting,
            YourDataClass("Hello", name),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```
