A Workflow can be made dynamic by adding `dynamic=True` to the `@workflow.defn` decorator.
The Workflow's run method must then accept a single argument of type `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`.
At runtime, the Workflow will be invoked if no Workflow with the given name is registered.
The input arguments are passed to the run method as the single `Sequence[RawValue]` argument.

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn(dynamic=True)
class GreetingWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        # Set initial greeting
        self.greeting = "Hello"

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, args: Sequence[RawValue]) -> str:
        name = args[0].payload
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            "unregistered_activity_name",
            name,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
# ...
        handle = await client.start_workflow(
            "UnregisteredWorkflowName",
            "World",
            id="hello-activity-workflow-id",
            task_queue="hello-activity-task-queue",
        )
```
