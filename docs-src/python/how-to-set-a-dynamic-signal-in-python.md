A Dynamic Signal in Temporal is a Signal that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Signal with the same input is registered.
A Signal can be made dynamic by adding `dynamic=True` to the `@signal.defn` decorator.

The Signal Handler should accept `self`, a string input, and a `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`.
The [payload_converter()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#payload_converter) function is used to convert a `RawValue` object to the desired type.

```python
# ...
    @workflow.signal(dynamic=True)
    async def dynamic_signal(self, input: str, args: Sequence[RawValue]) -> None:
        await self._pending_greetings.put(input)
```
