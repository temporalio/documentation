**Problem: You cannot deploy `post_patch_activity` directly until you're certain there are no more running Workflows created using the `pre_patch_activity` code, otherwise you are likely to cause a non-deterministic error.**

Instead, you'll need to deploy `post_patched_activity` and use the [patched](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#patched) function to determine which version of the code to execute.

Implementing patching involves three steps:

1. Use [patched](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#patched) to patch in new code and run it alongside the old code.
2. Remove the old code and apply [deprecate_patch](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#deprecate_patch).
3. Once you're confident that all old Workflows have finished executing, remove `deprecate_patch`.

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            post_patch_activity,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )
```
