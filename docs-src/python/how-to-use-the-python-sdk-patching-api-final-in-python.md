Now, you want to update your code to run `post_patch_activity` instead. This represents your desired end state.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/version_your_workflows/workflow_4_patch_complete_dacx.py) in the context of the rest of the application code.

:::

```python
from datetime import timedelta

from temporalio import workflow

with workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():
    from activities import post_patch_activity
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            post_patch_activity,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )
```
