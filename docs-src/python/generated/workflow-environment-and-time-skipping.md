[WorkflowEnvironment](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.testing.WorkflowEnvironment.html) is a class in the Temporal Python SDK that provides a testing suite for running Workflows and Activity code.
[start_time_skipping()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.testing.WorkflowEnvironment.html#start_time_skipping) is a method that allows you to skip time in a Workflow Execution.
By skipping time, you can quickly test how Workflows behave over extended periods of time without needing to wait in real-time.
