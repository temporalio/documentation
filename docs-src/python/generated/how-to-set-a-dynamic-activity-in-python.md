A Dynamic Activity in Temporal is an Activity that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Activity with the same name is registered.
An Activity can be made dynamic by adding `dynamic=True` to the `@activity.defn` decorator.
You must register the Activity with the [Worker](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.html) before it can be invoked.

The Activity Definition must then accept a single argument of type `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`.
The [payload_converter()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.activity.html#payload_converter) function is used to convert a `RawValue` object to the desired type.

```python

# ...
@activity.defn(dynamic=True)
async def dynamic_greeting(args: Sequence[RawValue]) -> str:
    arg1 = activity.payload_converter().from_payload(args[0].payload, YourDataClass)
    return (
        f"{arg1.greeting}, {arg1.name}!\nActivity Type: {activity.info().activity_type}"
    )
# ...
@workflow.defn
class GreetingWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            "unregistered_activity",
            YourDataClass("Hello", name),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```
