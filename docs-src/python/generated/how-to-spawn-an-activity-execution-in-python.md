To spawn an Activity Execution, use the [`execute_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_activity) operation from within your Workflow Definition.

`execute_activity()` is a shortcut for [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) that waits on its result.

To get just the handle to wait and cancel separately, use `start_activity()`.
In most cases, use `execute_activity()` unless advanced task capabilities are needed.

A single argument to the Activity is positional. Multiple arguments are not supported in the type-safe form of `start_activity()` or `execute_activity()` and must be supplied by the `args` keyword argument.
