```python

from datetime import datetime, timedelta

from temporalio.client import Client, ScheduleBackfill, ScheduleOverlapPolicy



async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = client.get_schedule_handle(
        "workflow-schedule-id",
    )
    now = datetime.utcnow()
    (
        await handle.backfill(
            ScheduleBackfill(
                start_at=now - timedelta(minutes=10),
                end_at=now - timedelta(minutes=9),
                overlap=ScheduleOverlapPolicy.ALLOW_ALL,
            ),
