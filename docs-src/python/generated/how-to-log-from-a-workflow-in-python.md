You can log from a Workflow using Python's standard library, by importing the logging module `logging`.

Set your logging configuration to a level you want to expose logs to.
The following example sets the logging information level to `INFO`.

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

Then in your Workflow, set your [`logger`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#logger) and level on the Workflow. The following example logs the Workflow.

<div class="copycode-notice-container"><div class="copycode-notice"><img data-style="copycode-icon" src="/icons/copycode.png" alt="Copy code icon" /> Sample application code information <img id="i-b0ae75c6-3fcf-4542-82b3-e8b7525bd78f" data-event="clickable-copycode-info" data-style="chevron-icon" src="/icons/chevron.png" alt="Chevron icon" /></div><div id="copycode-info-b0ae75c6-3fcf-4542-82b3-e8b7525bd78f" class="copycode-info">The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
