You can log from a Workflow using Python's standard library, by importing the logging module `logging`.

Set your logging configuration to a level you want to expose logs to.
The following example sets the logging information level to `INFO`.

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

Then in your Workflow, set your [`logger`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#logger) and level on the Workflow. The following example logs the Workflow.

<div class="copycode-notice-container"><a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/your_loggers/your_workflow_dacx.py">View the source code</a> in the context of the rest of the application code.</div>

```python
# ...
        workflow.logger.info("Workflow input parameter: %s" % name)
```
