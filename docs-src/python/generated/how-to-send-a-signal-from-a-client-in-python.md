To send a Signal from the Client, use the [signal()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#signal) function on the Workflow handle.

To get the Workflow handle, you can use any of the following options.

- Use the [get_workflow_handle()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle) method.
- Use the [get_workflow_handle_for()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle_for) method to get a type-safe Workflow handle by its Workflow Id.
- Use the [start_workflow()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) to start a Workflow and return its handle.

    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = await client.start_workflow(
        GreetingWorkflow.run,
        id="your-greeting-workflow",
        task_queue="signal-tq",
    )
    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.submit_greeting, "User 1")
