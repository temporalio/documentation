A Signal has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Signal type, is a string.
- The arguments must be serializable.
  To define a Signal, set the Signal decorator [`@workflow.signal`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#signal) on the Signal function inside your Workflow.

Non-dynamic methods can only have positional arguments.
Temporal suggests taking a single argument that is an object or data class of fields that can be added to as needed.

Return values from Signal methods are ignored.

**Customize names**

You can have a name parameter to customize the Signal's name, otherwise it defaults to the name of the Signal method.
