To run a Worker Process with a local development server, define the following steps in code:

- Initialize a Temporal Client.
- Create a new Worker by passing the Client to creation call.
- Register the application's Workflow and Activity functions.
- Call run on the Worker.

In regards to organization, we recommend keeping Worker code separate from Workflow and Activity code.

```python
import asyncio

from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.worker import Worker

from activities.ssntraceactivity_dacx import ssn_trace_activity
from workflows.backgroundcheck_dacx import BackgroundCheck



async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233", namespace="backgroundcheck_namespace",)

    worker = Worker(
        client,
        task_queue="backgroundcheck-boilerplate-task-queue",
        workflows=[BackgroundCheck],
        activities=[ssn_trace_activity],
    )

    await worker.run()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
