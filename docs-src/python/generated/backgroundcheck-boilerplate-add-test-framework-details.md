The `BackgroundCheck` Workflow code checks the following conditions:

1. It receives a social security number and a unique ID as input parameters.
2. It starts a new Activity `ssn_trace_activity` with the input SSN.
3. It waits for the Activity to complete and returns the result.
4. If the Activity returns "pass", it logs a message indicating that the background check passed.
5. If the Activity returns "fail", it raises an exception indicating that the background check failed.

We can also perform a Workflow Replay test, and we'll provide detailed coverage of this topic in another section.
