When a `Worker` is created, it accepts a list of Workflows in the `workflows` parameter, a list of Activities in the `activities` parameter, or both.

async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    worker = Worker(
        client,
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        workflows=[YourWorkflow],
        activities=[your_activity],
    )
    await worker.run()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
