This is because, Workflows in the Python SDK run in a sandbox, by default, to help avoid non-determinism code.

The sandbox is not foolproof and non-determinism can still occur. You are encouraged to define Workflows in files without side effects.

For information on the Sandbox, see [Sandbox](/python/python-sandbox-environment).
