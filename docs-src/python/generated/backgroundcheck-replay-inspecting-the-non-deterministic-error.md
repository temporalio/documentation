description: This kind of logic prevents the Workflow code from executing to completion because the Workflow can take a different code path than the one expected from the Event History.

This is because, Workflows in the Python SDK run in a sandbox, by default, to help avoid non-determinism code.

The sandbox is not foolproof and non-determinism can still occur. You are encouraged to define Workflows in files without side effects. This practice ensures a higher level of Workflow consistency and predictability.

For a deeper understanding of how the sandbox operates and its limitations, please refer to the guide on the [Sandbox](/python/python-sandbox-environment).
