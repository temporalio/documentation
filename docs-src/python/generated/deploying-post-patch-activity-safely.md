You can safely deploy `post_patch_activity` once all Workflows labeled my-patch or earlier are finished, based on the previously mentioned assertion.

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            post_patch_activity,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )
```
