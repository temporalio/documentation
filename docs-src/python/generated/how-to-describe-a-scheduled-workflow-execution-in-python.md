To describe a Scheduled Workflow Execution in Python, use the [describe()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.ScheduleHandle.html#delete) asynchronous method on the Schedule Handle.
You can get a complete list of the attributes of the Scheduled Workflow Execution from the [ScheduleDescription](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.ScheduleDescription.html) class.
