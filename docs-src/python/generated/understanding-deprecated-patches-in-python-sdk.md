After ensuring that all Workflows started with `pre_patch_activity` code have finished, you can [deprecate the patch](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#deprecate_patch).

Deprecated patches serve as a bridge between `pre_patch_activity` and `post_patch_activity`. They function similarly to regular patches by adding a marker to the Workflow History. However, this marker won't cause a replay failure when the Workflow code doesn't produce it.

If, during the deployment of `post_patch_activity`, there are still live Workers running `pre_patch_activity` code and these Workers pick up Workflow histories generated by `post_patch_activity`, they will safely use the patched branch.

    async def run(self) -> None:
        workflow.deprecate_patch("my-patch")
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
