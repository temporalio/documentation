To pause a Scheduled Workflow Execution in Python, use the [pause()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.ScheduleHandle.html#pause) asynchronous method on the Schedule Handle.
You can pass a `note` to the `pause()` method to provide a reason for pausing the schedule.

    await handle.pause(note="Pausing the schedule for now")
