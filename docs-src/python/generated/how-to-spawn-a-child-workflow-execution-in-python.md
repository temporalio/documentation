To spawn a Child Workflow Execution in Python, use the [`execute_child_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_child_workflow) function which starts the Child Workflow and waits for completion or
use the [`start_child_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_child_workflow) function to start a Child Workflow and return its handle.
This is useful if you want to do something after it has only started, or to get the Workflow/Run ID, or to be able to signal it while running.

:::note

`execute_child_workflow()` is a helper function for `start_child_workflow()` plus `await handle`.
