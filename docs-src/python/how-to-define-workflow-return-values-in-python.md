To return a value of the Workflow, use `return` to return an object.

To return the results of a Workflow Execution, use either `start_workflow()` or `execute_workflow()` asynchronous methods.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_workflows_dacx.py) in the context of the rest of the application code.

```python
from temporalio import workflow
# ...
# ...
@workflow.defn(name="YourWorkflow")
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams("Hello", name),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```
