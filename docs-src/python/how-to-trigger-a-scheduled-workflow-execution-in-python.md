To trigger a Scheduled Workflow Execution in Python, use the [trigger()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.ScheduleHandle.html#trigger) asynchronous method on the Schedule Handle.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = client.get_schedule_handle(
        "workflow-schedule-id",
    )

    await handle.trigger()
```
