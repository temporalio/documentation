To test a Heartbeat in an Activity, use the [`on_heartbeat()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.testing.ActivityEnvironment.html#on_heartbeat) property of the [`ActivityEnvironment`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.testing.ActivityEnvironment.html) class.
This property sets a custom function that is called every time the `activity.heartbeat()` function is called within the Activity.

```python
@activity.defn
async def activity_with_heartbeats(param: str):
    activity.heartbeat(f"param: {param}")
    activity.heartbeat("second heartbeat")

env = ActivityEnvironment()
heartbeats = []
# Set the `on_heartbeat` property to a callback function that will be called for each Heartbeat sent by the Activity.
env.on_heartbeat = lambda *args: heartbeats.append(args[0])
# Use the run method to start the Activity, passing in the function that contains the Heartbeats and any necessary parameters.
await env.run(activity_with_heartbeats, "test")
# Verify that the expected Heartbeats are received by the callback function.
assert heartbeats == ["param: test", "second heartbeat"]
```
