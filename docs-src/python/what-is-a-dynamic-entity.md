Temporal supports Dynamic Workflows, Activities, Signals, and Queries.
These are unnamed entities that are invoked if no other statically defined entity with the given name exists.

Dynamic Entities provide flexibility to handle cases where the names of Workflows, Activities, Signals, or Queries are not known at run time.
