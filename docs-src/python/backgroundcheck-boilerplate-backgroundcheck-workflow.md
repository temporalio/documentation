In the Temporal Python SDK programming model, a Workflow Definition is defined as a class.
The `BackgroundCheck class` below is an example of a basic Workflow Definition.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/backgroundcheck_boilerplate/workflows/backgroundcheck_dacx.py) in the context of the rest of the application code.

```python
from datetime import timedelta

from temporalio import workflow

with workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():
    from activities.ssntraceactivity_dacx import ssn_trace_activity



@workflow.defn
class BackgroundCheck:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, ssn: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            ssn_trace_activity,
            ssn,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
        )
```
