Use the `@workflow.defn` decorator on the `BackgroundCheck` class to identify a Workflow.

Use the `@workflow.run` to mark the entry point method to be invoked. This must be set on one asynchronous method defined on the same class as `@workflow.defn`.

Run methods have positional parameters.

By default Workflows are run in a sandbox to help avoid non-deterministic code.
If a call that is known to be non-deterministic is performed, an exception will be thrown in the workflow which will "fail the task" which means the workflow will not progress until fixed.
Import your Activity code into the Workflow Definition using the `with [workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.unsafe.html#imports_passed_through)` context manager.

To spawn an [Activity Execution](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_activity), call `execute_activity()` inside your Workflow Definition.
This API is available from the `workflow` module from the `temporalio` package.
The `execute_activity` API call requires either `schedule_to_close_timeout` or `start_to_close_timeout`.

In this example, pass in the Activity name, `ssn_trace_activity` and an argument, `ssn`.
We get into the best practices around Workflow params and returns in the one of the next sections.
