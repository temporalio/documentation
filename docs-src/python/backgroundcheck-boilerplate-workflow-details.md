Use the `@workflow.defn` decorator on the `BackgroundCheck` class to identify a Workflow.

Use the `@workflow.run` to mark the entry point method to be invoked. This must be set on one asynchronous method defined on the same class as `@workflow.defn`.

Run methods have positional parameters.

In this example, pass in the Activity name, `ssn_trace_activity` and an argument, `ssn`.
We get into the best practices around Workflow params and returns in the one of the next sections.
