Use the `@workflow.defn` decorator on the `BackgroundCheck` class to identify a Workflow.

Use the `@workflow.run` to mark the entry point method to be invoked. This must be set on one asynchronous method defined on the same class as `@workflow.defn`.

Run methods have positional parameters.

To spawn an [Activity Execution](notion://www.notion.so/activities#activity-execution), call `execute_activity()` inside your Workflow Definition.

This API is available from the `workflow` module from the `temporalio` package.

The `execute_activity` API call requires either `schedule_to_close_timeout` or `start_to_close_timeout`.

In this example, pass in the Activity name, `ssn_trace_activity` and an argument, `ssn`.
We get into the best practices around Workflow params and returns in the one of the next sections.

In regards to code organization, we recommend organizing Workflow code together with other Workflow code.
For example, in a small project like this, it is still a best practice to have a dedicated file for each Workflow.
