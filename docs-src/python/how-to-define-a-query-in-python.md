To define a Query, set the Query decorator [`@workflow.query`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#query) on the Query function inside your Workflow.

**Customize names**

You can have a name parameter to customize the Query's name, otherwise it defaults to the name of the Query method.

:::note

You can either set the `name` or the `dynamic` parameter in a Query's decorator, but not both.
