An append-log of [Events](/concepts/what-is-an-event) for your application.

- Event History is durably persisted by the Temporal service, enabling seamless recovery of your application state from crashes or failures.
- It also serves as an audit log for debugging.

**Event History limits**

The Temporal Cluster stores the complete Event History for the entire lifecycle of a Workflow Execution.

A Workflow Execution Event History has [a hard limit of 50,000 Events](/workflows#limits), as well as a hard limit of 50 MB in terms of size.
The Temporal Cluster logs a warning at every 10,000 Events.

When the Event History reaches 50,000 Events or the size limit of 50 MB, the Workflow Execution is forcefully terminated.
