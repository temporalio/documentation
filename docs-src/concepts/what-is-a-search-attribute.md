A Search Attribute is an indexed field used in a [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter) to filter a list of [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution) that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.

Each Search Attribute is a key-value pair metadata object and is part of the Workflow Execution visibility information, stored in the Visibility store. Use Search Attributes for metadata and search purposes only, not business logic.

Temporal provides some [default Search Attributes](#default-search-attributes), such as `ExecutionStatus` of your Workflow Execution.
You can also create [custom Search Attribute](#custom-search-attributes) keys in your Visibility store and assign values in a Workflow Execution.

Search Attribute values are assigned to a specific Workflow Execution and are available for that execution only for the duration of the specified Namespace [Retention Period](/concepts/what-is-a-retention-period).

Note that Search Attribute values are not encrypted because the Temporal Server must be able to read these values from the Visibility store when retrieving Workflow Execution details.

When using [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new) or a [Temporal Cron Job](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job), Search Attributes are carried over to the new Workflow Run by default.

### Default Search Attributes

A Temporal Cluster has a set of default Search Attributes already available.
Default Search Attributes are set globally in any Namespace.
These Search Attributes are created when the initial index is created.

- All default Search Attributes are reserved and read-only.
  You cannot create a custom one with the same name or alter the existing one.

- ExecutionStatus values correspond to Workflow Execution statuses: Running, Completed, Failed, Canceled, Terminated, ContinuedAsNew, TimedOut.

- StartTime, CloseTime, and ExecutionTime are stored as dates but are supported by queries that use either EpochTime in nanoseconds or a string in [RFC3339Nano format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants) (such as "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00").

- ExecutionDuration is stored in nanoseconds but is supported by queries that use integers in nanoseconds, [Golang duration format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration), or "hh:mm:ss" format.

- CloseTime, HistoryLength, StateTransitionCount, and ExecutionDuration are present only in a closed Workflow Execution.

- ExecutionTime can differ from StartTime in retry and cron use cases.

You can use the default Search Attributes in a List Filter, such as in the Temporal Web UI or with the `tctl workflow list` commands, under the following conditions:

- Without Advanced Visibility, you can only use the `=` operator with a single default Search Attribute in your List Filter.
  For example: `tctl workflow list -q "ExecutionStatus = 'Completed'"` or `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = 'YourWorkflow'"`.
- With Advanced Visibility, you can combine default Search Attributes in a List Filter to get a list of specific Workflow Executions.
  For example: `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = 'main.YourWorkflowDefinition' and ExecutionStatus != 'Running' and (StartTime > '2022-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00' or CloseTime < '2022-06-08T16:46:34-08:00')"`

### Custom Search Attributes

You can [create custom Search Attributes](/clusters/how-to-create-custom-search-attribute-keys) with unique key names that are relevant to your business needs.

Use custom Search Attributes in a List Filter, such as in the Temporal Web UI or with the `tctl workflow list` commands, under the following conditions:

- Without Advanced Visibility, you cannot use a custom Search Attribute in your List Filter.
- With Advanced Visibility, you can create multiple custom Search Attributes and use them in combinations with List Filters to get a list of specific Workflow Executions.
  For example: `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = 'main.YourWorkflowDefinition' and YourCustomSA = 'YourCustomSAValue' and (StartTime > '2022-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00' or CloseTime < '2022-06-08T16:46:34-08:00')"`
  - With Temporal Server v1.19 and earlier, you must [integrate Elasticsearch](/clusters/how-to-integrate-elasticsearch-into-a-temporal-cluster) to use custom Search Attributes with List Filters.
  - With Temporal Server v1.20 and later, custom Search Attribute capabilities are available on MySQL (v8.0.17 or later), PostgreSQL (v12 and later), and SQLite (v3.31.0 and later), in addition to Elasticsearch.

If you use Elasticsearch as your Visibility store, your custom Search Attributes apply globally and can be used across Namespaces.
However, if using any of the [supported SQL databases](/cluster-deployment-guide#visibility-store) with Temporal Server v1.20 and later, your custom Search Attributes are associated with a specific Namespace and can be used for Workflow Executions in that Namespace.

See [custom Search Attributes limits](#custom-search-attributes-limits) for limits on the number and size of custom Search Attributes you can create.

#### Supported types

Custom Search Attributes must be one of the following types:

- Bool
- Datetime
- Double
- Int
- Keyword
- KeywordList
- Text

Note:

- **Double** is backed up by `scaled_float` Elasticsearch type with scale factor 10000 (4 decimal digits).
- **Datetime** is backed up by `date` type with milliseconds precision in Elasticsearch 6 and `date_nanos` type with nanoseconds precision in Elasticsearch 7.
- **Int** is 64-bit integer (`long` Elasticsearch type).
- **Keyword** and **Text** types are concepts taken from Elasticsearch. Each word in a **Text** is considered a searchable keyword.
  For a UUID, that can be problematic because Elasticsearch indexes each portion of the UUID separately.
  To have the whole string considered as a searchable keyword, use the **Keyword** type.
  For example, if the key `ProductId` has the value of `2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`:
  - As a **Keyword** it would be matched only by `ProductId = "2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`.
  - As a **Text** it would be matched by `ProductId = 2dd8`, which could cause unwanted matches.
- With Temporal Server v1.19 and earlier, the **Keyword** type can store a list of values.
- With Temporal Server v1.20 and later, the **Keyword** type supports only a single value.
  To store a list of values, use **KeywordList**.
- The **Text** type cannot be used in the "Order By" clause.

#### Custom Search Attributes limits

<!-- TODO - [How to configure maximum number of Search Attribute keys per Cluster](#) -->

The following table lists the maximum number of custom Search Attributes you can create per Namespace by supported Visibility database.

| Search Attribute type | MySQL (v8.0.17 and later) | PostgreSQL (v12 and later) | SQLite (v3.31.0 and later) | Temporal Cloud |
| --------------------- | :-----------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------: |
| Bool                  |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |
| Datetime              |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |
| Double                |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |

| Keyword               |            10             |             10             |             10             |       20       |
| KeywordList           |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |
| Text                  |             3             |             3              |             3              |       5        |

Temporal does not impose a limit on the number of custom Search Attributes you can create with Elasticsearch. However, [Elasticsearch sets a default mapping limit](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/mapping-settings-limit.html) that may apply.
Custom Search Attributes are an Advanced Visibility feature and are not supported on Cassandra.

Size limits for a custom Search Attribute:

<!--
_This refers to the SA key you create in the visibility store with `tctl search-attribute create`. this value is no longer applicable so commenting out for ref later_
Default total maximum number of Search Attribute **keys** per Temporal Cluster is 100.-->

- The default single Search Attribute **value** size limit is 2 KB.

<!-- TODO - [How to configure Search Attribute value size limit](#) -->

- The maximum total Search Attribute size is 40 KB.

<!-- TODO - [How to configure total Search Attribute size limite](#) -->

<!-- temp keeping for reference
This is configurable with [`SearchAttributesNumberOfKeysLimit`, `SearchAttributesTotalSizeLimit` and `SearchAttributesSizeOfValueLimit`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L440-L442), if you know what you are doing.
-->

### Usage

Search Attributes available in your Visibility store can be used with Workflow Executions for that Cluster.
To actually have results from the use of a [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter), Search Attributes must be added to a Workflow Execution as metadata.

- To create custom Search Attributes in your Visibility store, see [Create custom Search Attributes](/clusters/how-to-create-custom-search-attribute-keys).
- To remove a custom Search Attribute from the Visbility store, see [Remove custom Search Attributes](/clusters/how-to-remove-a-custom-search-attribute-key).
  Removing custom Search Attributes is not supported on Temporal Cloud.
- To rename a custom Search Attribute on Temporal Cloud, see [`tcld namespace search-attributes rename`](/cloud/tcld/namespace#rename).

With Workflows you can do the following:

- Set the value of Search Attributes in your Workflow
- Update the value set for a Search Attribute from within the Workflow code
- Remove the value set for a Search Attribute from within the Workflow code

- To get a list of Search Attributes using `tctl`, see [How to view Search Attributes using tctl](/tctl-v1/cluster#get-search-attributes).

After you add and set your Search Attributes, use your default or custom Search Attributes in a List Filter.

<!-- commenting out this part. added this detail in how to create a custom search attribute under clusters.
The [temporalio/auto-setup](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/auto-setup) Docker image uses a pre-defined set of custom Search Attributes that are handy for testing.
Their names indicate their types:

- CustomBoolField
- CustomDatetimeField
- CustomDoubleField
- CustomIntField
- CustomKeywordField
- CustomTextField
