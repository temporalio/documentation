A Temporal Cluster is the group of services, known as the [Temporal Server](/concepts/what-is-the-temporal-server), combined with [Persistence](/concepts/what-is-persistence) and [Visibility](/concepts/what-is-visibility) stores, that together act as a component of the Temporal Platform.

<!-- ### Visibility
Commenting this out because it is out of place. Using the what is visibility concept topic in the guide instead.
Also these details are covered in the Visibility store setup under cluster deployment.

Temporal has built-in [Visibility](/concepts/what-is-visibility) features.
To enhance this feature, Temporal supports an [integration with Elasticsearch](/clusters/how-to-integrate-elasticsearch-into-a-temporal-cluster).

- Elasticsearch v8 is supported from Temporal version 1.18.0 onwards
- Elasticsearch v7.10 is supported from Temporal version 1.7.0 onwards
- Elasticsearch v6.8 is supported up to Temporal version 1.17.x
- Elasticsearch v6.8 and v7.10 versions are explicitly supported with AWS Elasticsearch -->
