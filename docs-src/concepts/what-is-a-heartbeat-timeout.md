A Heartbeat Timeout is the maximum time between [Activity Heartbeats](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-heartbeat).

- [How to set a Heartbeat Timeout](/application-development/features#heartbeat-timeout)

![Heartbeat Timeout periods](/diagrams/heartbeat-timeout.svg)

If this timeout is reached, the Activity Task fails and a retry occurs if a [Retry Policy](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy) dictates it.
