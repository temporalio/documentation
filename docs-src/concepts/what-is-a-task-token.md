A Task Token is a unique identifier for an [Activity Task Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution).

[Asynchronous Activity Completion](/concepts/what-is-asynchronous-activity-completion/) calls take either of the following as arguments:

- a Task Token, or
- an [Activity Id](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-id), a [Workflow Id](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id), and optionally a [Run Id](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id/).
