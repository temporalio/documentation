[Temporal Cloud](https://temporal.io/cloud) is a managed, hosted Temporal environment that provides a platform for [Temporal Applications](/temporal/#temporal-application)â€”an alternative to deploying and operating your own [Temporal Cluster](/clusters).

Temporal Cloud is offered in units of isolation known as [Namespaces](/namespaces). You can provision and use one or more Cloud Namespaces. A typical use case is to use separate Namespaces as development, testing, integration, staging, and production environments for an application.
