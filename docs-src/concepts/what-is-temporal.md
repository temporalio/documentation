Temporal is a scalable and reliable runtime for durable function executions called [Temporal Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution).

Said another way, it's a platform that guarantees the [Durable Execution](/concepts/what-is-durable-execution) of your application code.

It enables you to develop as if failures don't even exist.
Your application will run reliably even if it encounters problems, such as network outages or server crashes, which would be catastrophic for a typical application.
The Temporal Platform handles these types of problems, allowing you to focus on the business logic, instead of writing application code to detect and recover from failures.
