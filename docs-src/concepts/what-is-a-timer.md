Temporal SDKs offer Timer APIs so that Workflow Executions are deterministic in their handling of time values.

Timers in Temporal are persisted, meaning that even if your Worker or Temporal Cluster is down when the time period completes, as soon as your Worker and Cluster become available, the call that is awaiting the Timer in your Workflow code will resolve, causing execution to proceed
Timers are reliable and efficient.
Workers consume no additional resources while waiting for a Timer to fire, so a single Worker can await millions of Timers concurrently.

The duration of a Timer is fixed, and your Workflow might specify a value as short as one second or as long as several years.
Although it's possible to specify an extremely precise duration, such as 36 milliseconds or 15.072 minutes, your Workflows should not rely on sub-second accuracy for Timers.
We recommend that you consider the duration as a minimum time, one which will be rounded up slightly due to the latency involved with scheduling and firing the Timer.
For example, setting a Timer for 11.97 seconds is guaranteed to delay execution for at least that long, but will likely be closer to 12 seconds in practice.
