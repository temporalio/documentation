A Failure Converter converts error objects to proto Failures and back.
The default Failure Converter copies error messages and stack traces as plain text.

For details, see the API references.

- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#FailureConverter)
- [Java](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/failure/FailureConverter.html)
- [Python](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.converter.FailureConverter.html)
- [TypeScript](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.FailureConverter)

You can make a custom Failure Converter, but if you use multiple SDKs, you must implement the same logic in each.
Creating a custom Failure Converter is not yet supported in Java.

Failure messages and stack traces are not encoded as codec-capable Payloads by default; you must explicitly enable encoding these common attributes on failures.
If your errors might contain sensitive information, you can encrypt the message and stack trace by configuring the default Failure Converter to use your encoded attributes, in which case it moves your `message` and `stack_trace` fields to a Payload that's run through your [codec](/concepts/what-is-a-payload-codec).
