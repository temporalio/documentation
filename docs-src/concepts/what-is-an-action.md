An Action is the fundamental pricing unit in [Temporal Cloud](/concepts/what-is-temporal-cloud).

The following operations result in Actions, which are billed monthly.

**Workflows**

- **Workflow started.**
  Occurs via client start, client Signal-With-Start, [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new), or [Child Workflow](/concepts/what-is-a-child-workflow-execution) start.
  If a Workflow start fails, an Action is not recorded.
- **Workflow reset.**
  Occurs when a [Workflow](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow) is reset.
  (Actions that occur before a [Reset](/concepts/what-is-a-reset) are counted even if they are no longer visible in [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history).)
- **Timer started.**
  Includes implicit Timers that are started by a Temporal SDK when timeouts are set, such as `AwaitWithTimeout` in Go or `condition` in TypeScript.
- **Search Attribute upsert requested.**
  Occurs after a Workflow starts and invokes `UpsertSearchAttributes`.
- **Signal sent.**
  Includes sending a [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal) from a client or from within a Workflow to another Workflow.
- **Query received.** [Queries](/concepts/what-is-a-query) aren't recorded in Event History.
  An operation such as viewing the stack trace in the Temporal Cloud UI results in a Query.
- **Version marker recorded.**
  Occurs when a Workflow calls `get-version` or `patch`.
- **Side Effect recorded.**
  For a mutable [Side Effect](/concepts/what-is-a-side-effect), an Action occurs only when the value changes.
  (Be aware that some SDKs don't support Side Effects.)

**Activities**

- **Activity started or retried.**
  Occurs each time an Activity is started or retried.
- **Local Activity started.**
  Occurs each time a [Local Activity](/concepts/what-is-a-local-activity) is started.
- **Activity Heartbeat recorded.**
  A Heartbeat call from Activity code counts as an Action only if it reaches the [Temporal Server](/concepts/what-is-the-temporal-server).
  Temporal SDKs throttle [Activity Heartbeats](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-heartbeat).
  The default throttle is 80% of the [Heartbeat Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout).
  Heartbeats don't apply to Local Activities.
