The Temporal CLI is a command-line tool that includes a distribution of a Temporal Cluster ([Temporal Server](/concepts/what-is-the-temporal-server), persistence (SQLite), and the [Temporal Web UI](/concepts/what-is-the-temporal-web-ui)).
The tool runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies and supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.

### Available commands

- [temporal activity](/cli/activity/)
- [temporal batch](/cli/batch/)
- [temporal env](/cli/env/)
- [temporal operator](/cli/operator/)
- [temporal schedule](/cli/schedule/)
- [temporal server](/cli/server)
- [temporal task-queue](/cli/task-queue/)
- [temporal workflow](/cli/workflow/)

## Installation

Temporal CLI can be installed through several different methods.

For more information, see our guide to [running a Development Cluster](/clusters/how-to-install-temporal-cli).

## Starting the Temporal Server

Run the following command to start the Temporal Server.
This command also starts the Web UI.

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

At this point you should have a server running on `localhost:7233` and a web interface at <http://localhost:8233>.
A default Namespace has also been created.

Run individual commands to interact with the local Temporal Server.

```bash
temporal operator namespace list
temporal workflow list
```

## Configuration

Use the help flag to see a full list of CLI options:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --help
```

### Namespace registration

Namespaces are pre-registered at startup so they're available to use immediately.
To customize the pre-registered namespaces, start the server with the following:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --namespace foo --namespace bar
```

You can also register Namespaces with the following command:

```bash
temporal operator namespace create foo
```

### Persistence modes

By default, `temporal server start-dev` runs in an in-memory mode.

To persist the state to a file on disk, use `--db-filename`:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --db-filename my_test.db
```

### Enable or disable Temporal UI

By default, the Temporal UI is started with Temporal CLI. The UI can be disabled via a runtime flag:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --headless
```

### Dynamic configuration

Advanced configuration of the Temporal CLI requires the use of a dynamic configuration file.
This file is created outside the Temporal CLI; it is usually located with the service's config files.

Dynamic configuration values can also be set via `--dynamic-config-value KEY=JSON_VALUE`.
For example, to enable the Search Attribute cache (disabled by default), run the following:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --dynamic-config-value system.forceSearchAttributesCacheRefreshOnRead=false
```

This setting makes created Search Attributes immediately available for use.

## Environmental variables

The Temporal CLI hosts a set of Client Options that can be used to configure the system environment.
Use the following table as a reference for the Temporal CLI environmental variables.

| Variable                                     | Definition                                                                        | Client Option                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `TEMPORAL_CLI_ADDRESS`                       | The host and port (formatted as host:port) for the Temporal Frontend Service.     | --address                       |
| `TEMPORAL_CLI_CODEC_AUTH`                    | Sets the authorization header on requests to the Codec Server.                    | --codec-auth                    |
| `TEMPORAL_CLI_CODEC_ENDPOINT`                | Endpoint for a remote Codec Server.                                               | --codec-endpoint                |
| `TEMPORAL_CONTEXT_TIMEOUT`                   | An optional timeout for the context of an RPC call (in seconds). Default value: 5 | --context-timeout               |
| `TEMPORAL_CLI_NAMESPACE`                     | Identifies a Namespace in the Temporal Workflow. Default value: "default".        | --namespace                     |
| `TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_CA`                        | Path to server CA certificate.                                                    | --tls-ca-path                   |
| `TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_CERT`                      | Path to x509 certificate.                                                         | --tls-cert-path                 |
| `TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_DISABLE_HOST_VERIFICATION` | Disables TLS host name verification if already enabled. Default value: false.     | --tls-disable-host-verification |
| `TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_KEY`                       | Path to private certificate key.                                                  | --tls-key-path                  |
| `TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_SERVER_NAME`               | Provides an override for the target TLS server name.                              | --tls-server-name               |

## Auto-completion

The Temporal CLI has the capability to auto-complete commands.

Running `temporal completion SHELL` outputs the related completion SHELL code.

### zsh auto-completion

<!-- TODO: add more information about zsh to make comparable to bash section -->

Add the following code snippet to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
source <(temporal completion zsh)
```

If you're running auto-completion from the terminal, run the following command:

```sh
echo 'source <(temporal completion zsh)' >> ~/.zshrc
```

After setting the variable, run the following command:

`source ~/.zshrc`.

### Bash auto-completion

Bash auto-completion relies on `bash-completion`.

Install the software with the steps provided in the [bash-completion README](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion#installation), or use your preferred package manager on your operating system.

For more information, see [the Bash Completion page on Repology](https://repology.org/project/bash-completion/versions).
