Add a Docker file to the root of your Background Check application project.

Name the file `dockerfile`, with no extensions, and add the following configuration:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20 as build

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json /app
COPY package-lock.json /app

RUN npm ci

COPY tsconfig.json /app/
COPY src /app/src

RUN npm run build

# Reinstall without dev dependencies now that the application is built
RUN npm ci --omit dev

FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian11


COPY --from=build /app/node_modules /app/node_modules
COPY --from=build /app/lib /app/lib

CMD ["/app/lib/worker.js"]
```

Then build the Docker image using the following command:

```shell
docker build . -t backgroundcheck-worker-image:latest
```

Now run the Worker on the same network as the Temporal Cluster containers using the following command:

```shell
docker run --network temporal-network backgroundcheck-worker-image:latest
```
