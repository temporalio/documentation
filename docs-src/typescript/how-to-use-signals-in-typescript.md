To add a Signal to a Workflow, call `defineSignal()` with a name, and then attach a listener with `setHandler()`.

- Handlers to take arguments, which can be used inside `setHandler()` logic.
- Signal handlers can mutate state, Signal handlers cannot return values.

**Declare your Signal as constants outside the Workflow Definition**

```typescript
import * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';

export const unblockSignal = wf.defineSignal('unblock');
 let isBlocked = true;
 wf.setHandler(unblockSignal, () => void (isBlocked = false));
 console.log('Blocked');
 try {
   await wf.condition(() => !isBlocked);
   console.log('Unblocked');
 } catch (err) {
   if (err instanceof wf.CancelledFailure) {
     console.log('Cancelled');
   }
   throw err;
 }
}
```

This code defines a Signal as _unblock_ and declares the variable as _isBlocked_ as true. Then the code tries to execute the condition and print _Unblocked_ to the console if it becomes unblocked. Finally, the code catches any errors, and if the error is `CancelledFailure`, then it prints `Cancelled` to the console.

This helps provide type safety, since you can export the type signature of the Signal or Query to be called on the client side.

##### Declare your Signals dynamically

For more flexible usecases, you may want a dynamic Signal, such as a generated identifier. You may handle it in two ways:

- avoid making it dynamic by collapsing all signals in one handler and move the identifier to the payload.
- actually make the Signal name dynamic by inlining the Signal definition per handler.

```typescript
import * as wf from "@temporalio/workflow";

wf.setHandler(`genericSignal`, (payload) => {
  switch (payload.taskId) {
    case taskAId:
      // do task A things
      break;
    case taskBId:
      // do task B things
      break;
    default:
      throw new Error("Unexpected task.");
  }
});

// "inline definition" solution
wf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(`task-${taskAId}`), (payload) => {
  /* do task A things */
});
wf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(`task-${taskBId}`), (payload) => {
  /* do task B things */
});

// utility "inline definition" helper
const inlineSignal = (signalName, handler) =>
  wf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(signalName), handler);
inlineSignal(`task-${taskBId}`, (payload) => {
  /* do task B things */
});
```

:::note

The semantics of `defineSignal()` and `defineQuery()` is intentional, in that they return Signal/Query Definitions, not unique instances of Signals and Queries themselves.
Signals and Queries are only instantiated in `setHandler()` and are specific to a particular Workflow Execution.

These distinctions may seem minor, but they model how Temporal works under the hood, because Signals and Queries are messages identified by _just strings_ and don't have meaning independent of the Workflow having a listener to handle them.

We named it `setHandler` instead of `subscribe` because Signals and Queries can only have one handler at a time, whereas `subscribe` could imply an observable with multiple consumers, and is a higher level construct.

#### Start a Signal from the Client

Sending Signals requires a Workflow handle from a Temporal Client.

- You send a Signal with `handle.signal(signal, ...args)`. A Signal has no return value by definition.
- You can refer to a Signal by string name, which is useful for dynamic reference, but you will lose type inference

The following code is from inside the Client code.

```typescript
import {count, increment} from "./workflow";

// init client code omitted - see Client docs
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);

// these three are equivalent
await handle.signal(increment, 1);
await handle.signal<[number]>("increment", 1);
await client.getHandle(workflowId).signal(increment, 1);
```
