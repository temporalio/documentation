Use a new `WorflowClient()` with the requisite gRPC [`Connection`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.Connection#service) to create a new Client.

```typescript
import {Connection, WorkflowClient} from "@temporalio/client";
const connection = await Connection.connect(); // to configure for production
const client = new WorkflowClient({connection});
```

Declaring the `WorflowClient()` creates a new connection to the Temporal service.

If you omit the connection and just call the `new WorkflowClient()`, you create a default connection that works locally.
However, always configure your connection and Namespace when [deploying to production](/typescript/security/#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls).

The following example, creates a Client, connects to an account, and declares your Namespace.

```typescript
import {Connection, WorkflowClient} from "@temporalio/client";

const connection = await Connection.connect({
  address: "<Namespace_ID>.tmprl.cloud",
});
const client = new WorkflowClient({
  connection,
  namespace: "your.namespace",
});
```
