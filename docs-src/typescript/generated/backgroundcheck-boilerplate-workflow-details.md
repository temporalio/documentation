Temporal Workflows may have any number of custom parameters. However, we
strongly recommend that you use objects as parameters, so that the object's
individual fields may be altered without changing the signature of the
Workflow. All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable.

Workflow return values must also be serializable. Returning results, returning
errors, or throwing exceptions is fairly idiomatic in each language that is
supported. However, Temporal APIs that must be used to get the result of a
Workflow Execution will only ever receive one of either the result or the
error.

To return a value of the Workflow function, use `Promise<something>`. The
Promise is used to make asynchronous calls and comes with guarantees.
