In the Temporal TypeScript SDK programming model, a [Workflow Definition](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition) is an exportable function.

Open the `src/workflows.ts` file in your editor. You'll place your Workflow Definition in this file.

To define a Workflow, import the Activity types and the `@temporalio/workflow` libraries:
Define the Activity Execution options. `StartToCloseTimeout` or `ScheduleToCloseTimeout` must be set:
The `backgroundCheck` function that follows is an example of a basic Workflow Definition.

```typescript
import * as workflow from '@temporalio/workflow';
import type * as activities from './activities';

const { ssnTrace } = workflow.proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '10 seconds',
});

export async function backgroundCheck(ssn: string): Promise<string> {
  return await ssnTrace(ssn);
}
