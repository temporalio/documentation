In the Temporal TypeScript SDK programming model, an Activity is an exportable async function.

You'll define your Activities in this file.

Add the following code to define your Activity:

<div class="copycode-notice-container"><a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/typescript/chapter_project_setup/backgroundcheck/src/activities.ts">View the source code</a> in the context of the rest of the application code.</div>

```typescript
export async function ssnTrace(param: string): Promise<string> {
  // This is where a call to another service is made
  // Here we are pretending that the service that does SSNTrace returned "pass"
  return 'pass';
}
```
