In the Temporal TypeScript SDK programming model, an Activity is an exportable async function.

You'll define your Activities in this file.

Add the following code to define your Activity:

<div class="copycode-notice-container"><div class="copycode-notice"><img data-style="copycode-icon" src="/icons/copycode.png" alt="Copy code icon" /> Sample application code information <img id="i-id-1394041892" data-event="clickable-copycode-info" data-style="chevron-icon" src="/icons/chevron.png" alt="Chevron icon" /></div><div id="copycode-info-id-1394041892" class="copycode-info">The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application. The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects. Visit the source repository to <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/typescript/chapter_project_setup/backgroundcheck/src/activities.ts">view the source code</a> in the context of the rest of the application code.</div></div>

```typescript
export async function ssnTrace(param: string): Promise<string> {
  // This is where a call to another service is made
  // Here we are pretending that the service that does SSNTrace returned "pass"
  return 'pass';
}
```
