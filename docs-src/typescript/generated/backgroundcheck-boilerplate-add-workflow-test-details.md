This test uses a local testing server that ships with the Temporal TypeScript SDK.
This server becomes the environment that runs the Worker. This example uses the `before` and `after` hooks
to set up and tear down the test environment.

In the body of the test case, you create an instance of a Worker and specify the Workflow and Activities.
In this example, the Activity is mocked out and replaced with a function that returns a specific result.
This ensures that the Workflow test doesn't invoke the actual Activity.

Calling `client.workflow.execute(...)` executes the Workflow logic and any invoked Activities inside the test process.
The first parameter of `env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` contains a reference to the
Workflow function. The second parameter contains an object that specifices the arguments for the Workflow, the Workflow ID,
and a Task Queue name.
