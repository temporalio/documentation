Non-deterministic code can be hard to catch while developing Workflows.
You can leverage the Temporal TypeScript VSCode extenstion to debug your Workflows by their ID or Workflow Event History file.
Use the [Temporal Debugger for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=temporal-technologies.temporalio).

See the [vscode-debugger-extension README](https://github.com/temporalio/vscode-debugger-extension/blob/main/README.md) for details on how to use it.
