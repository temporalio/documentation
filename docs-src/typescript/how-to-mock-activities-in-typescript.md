Implement only the relevant Activities for the Workflow being tested.

```ts
import type * as activities from "./activities";

// Creating a mock object of the activities.
const mockActivities: Partial<typeof activities> = {
  makeHTTPRequest: async () => "99",
};

// Creating a worker with the mocked activities.
const worker = await Worker.create({
  activities: mockActivities,
  // ...
});
```
