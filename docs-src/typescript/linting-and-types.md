If you started your project with `@temporalio/create`, you already have our recommended TypeScript and ESLint configurations.

If you incrementally added Temporal to an existing app, we do recommend setting up linting and types because they help catch bugs well before you ship them to production, and they improve your development feedback loop.
Take a look at our recommended [.eslintrc](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/.shared/.eslintrc.js) file and tweak to suit your needs.
