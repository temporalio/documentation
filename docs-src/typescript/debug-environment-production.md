You can debug production Workflows using:

- [Web UI](/web-ui)
- [tctl](/tctl-v1)
- [Replay](/typescript/testing#replay)
- [Tracing](/typescript/observability#tracing)
- [Logging](/typescript/observability#logging)

You can debug and tune Worker performance with metrics and the [Worker performance guide](/dev-guide/worker-performance).
For information on setting up SDK metrics, see [Metrics](/dev-guide/typescript/observability#metrics) in the Observability section of the TypeScript SDK developer's guide.

Debug Server performance with [Cloud metrics](/cloud/how-to-monitor-temporal-cloud-metrics) or [self-hosted Server metrics](/kb/legacy-oss-prod-deploy#scaling-and-metrics).
