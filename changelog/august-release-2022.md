- We added a [Getting started with Temporal Cloud](/cloud/how-to-get-started-with-temporal-cloud) guide!

- We also added guides for [managing certificates](/cloud/how-to-manage-certificates-in-temporal-cloud) and [managing Namespaces](/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud) in Temporal Cloud.

- The Temporal blog moved from docs.temporal.io to [temporal.io/blog](https://temporal.io/blog).

- A new [KB articles](https://docs.temporal.io/kb) section introduces a “general knowledge base article” information archetype to the Temporal Platform documentation.
  This information archetype aims to answer questions such as “what is an aggregation of things of this theme?”, “what are similarities and differences between things?”, “how to do something that bridges Temporal and other tech stacks”, “how to do something that is less common”, and so on.
