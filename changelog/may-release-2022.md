- We removed `/docs` from the URLs of documentation pages.
  Redirects are in place, but we encourage you to update your references to our pages when possible.

- `/cloud` now exists with early versions of Temporal Cloud documentation.

- The sidebar on the left now represents the main navigation for Temporal documentation.

- The Temporal Developer's guide is **new** and represents the next generation of Developer's guide documentation. Let us know what you think!

- Older, “legacy” SDK pages are still available, but our focus moving forward is on the [Developer's guide](/application-development).
