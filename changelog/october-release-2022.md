During the past month, the following content has been added or improved:

- We added and defined [History Shard](/clusters/#history-shard) as a core term.

- We updated information about [Namespaces](/namespaces) and [Retention Periods](/clusters/#retention-period).

- We added a section on how to [Manage Namespaces](/application-development/features/#namespaces) in the Developer’s guide.

- We added a [reference of metrics](/references/cluster-metrics) that are emitted from a Temporal Cluster.

- We published the [“next version” of Temporal’s CLI](/tctl-next/).
  The future name of the CLI is yet to be determined, but the functionality is available to use as tctl v2.0.0-beta.
  Both [tctl v1.16](/tctl-v1/) and tctl version-next docs are available.
