Since last month's release, we have added or improved the following:

- We added and defined [History Shard](/clusters/#history-shard) as a core term.

- We updated information about [Namespaces](/namespaces) and [Retention Periods](/clusters/#retention-period), and added a section on how to [Manage Namespaces](/application-development/features/#namespaces) in the Developer’s guide.

- Added a [reference of metrics](/references/cluster-metrics) that are emitted from a Temporal Cluster.

<!-- Uncomment once landed
- Added a reference of [Web UI environment variables](/references/web-ui-environment-variables) that map to the [Web UI configuration](/references/web-ui-configuration).
-->

- We published the [“next version” of Temporal’s CLI](/tctl-next/).
  The future name of the CLI is “tbd”, but the functionality is available to use as tctl v2.0.0-beta.
  Both [tctl v1.16](/tctl-v1/) and tctl version-next docs are available.
