If the Workflow receives a Cancellation Request, but all Activities gracefully handle the Cancellation, and/or no Activities are skipped then the Workflow status will be Complete.
It is completely up to the needs of the business process and your use case which determines whether you want to return the Cancellation error to show a Canceled status or Complete status regardless of whether a Cancellation has propagated to and/or skipped Activities.
