/*
In the Temporal TypeScript SDK programming model, an Activity is an exportable async function.

You'll define your Activities in this file.

Add the following code to define your Activity:
*/

export async function ssnTrace(param: string): Promise<string> {
  // This is where a call to another service is made
  // Here we are pretending that the service that does SSNTrace returned "pass"
  return 'pass';
}

/*
This Activity definition uses a single input parameter and returns a string.

An Activity Definition can support as many other custom parameters as needed.
However, all parameters must be serializable.

We recommend creating an Interface and using a single input parameter rather
than using multiple input parameters.
