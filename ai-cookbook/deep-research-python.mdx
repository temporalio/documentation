Deep research systems combine multiple agents with information retrieval from
the web or other sources to produce evidence-based reports on specific topics.
Commercial implementations include
[Anthropic Research](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system),
[OpenAI Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/), and
[Google Gemini Deep Research](https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research/).

This recipe demonstrates a simple deep research system embodying the standard
deep research architecture. Deep research spans the following four phases:

- **Planning**. Task decomposition and research strategy formulation. This
  involves identifying separate aspects of the research problem that can be
  worked on independently.
- **Question Development/Query Generation**. Designing queries for each of the
  research questions.
- **Web Exploration/Information Retrieval**. Searching the web to retrieve
  documents relevant to the research question. Extracting and summarizing
  relevant information.
- **Report Generation/Synthesis**. Synthesizing findings into comprehensive,
  well-cited reports.

Deep research tasks can involve dozens of searches and process hundreds of
documents. This creates many possible failure modes that durable execution helps
protect against.

This recipe uses OpenAI's Responses API, which includes a tool for web search.
It also uses OpenAI's
[Structured Outputs API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs),
which asks the model to generate outputs corresponding to desired data
structures.

## Create the data structures

We will use Python classes to ensure information passes between agents in a
structured way.

The Planning Agent creates a `ResearchPlan`, which includes a research question,
a list of `ResearchAspects`, expected sources, a search strategy, and success
criteria. ResearchAspects include an aspect name, a priority, and a description.

```python
class ResearchPlan(BaseModel):
    research_question: str
    key_aspects: List[ResearchAspect]
    expected_sources: List[str]
    search_strategy: str
    success_criteria: List[str]
```

```python
class ResearchAspect(BaseModel):
    aspect: str
    priority: int
    description: str
```

The Query Generation Agent creates a `QueryPlan`, and generates a list of
`SearchQueries`.

```python
class QueryPlan(BaseModel):
    queries: List[SearchQuery]
```

```python
class SearchQuery(BaseModel):
    query: str
    rationale: str
    expected_info_type: str
    priority: int
```

The Web Search Agent creates a `SearchResult`, which includes a query, a list of
sources, a key finding, a relevance score, and a list of citations.

```python
class SearchResult(BaseModel):
    query: str
    sources: List[str]
    key_findings: str
    relevance_score: float
    citations: List[str]
```

Finally, the Report Synthesis Agent creates a `ResearchReport`, which includes
an executive summary, a detailed analysis, a list of key findings, a confidence
assessment, a list of citations, and a list of follow-up questions.

```python
class ResearchReport(BaseModel):
    executive_summary: str
    detailed_analysis: str
    key_findings: List[str]
    confidence_assessment: str
    citations: List[str]
    follow_up_questions: List[str]
```

## Create the Agents

The deep research system uses four specialized agents, each implemented as
Temporal activities. In this implementation, each agent is implemented as a
single call to the OpenAI Responses API.

This is possible because we are using structured outputs, which guarantee the
response will be in the correct format, eliminating the need for retries.

The web search agent also requires only a single API call because OpenAI
integrates the web search tool into the Responses API.

These agents run in the Workflow and use the `invoke_model` activity to make
OpenAI API calls. It is critical to set the `start_to_close_timeout` for these
activities to a value that is long enough to complete the task. If it is too
short, the activity will fail with a timeout error, causing a retry loop that
never completes. Response times for reasoning models such as `GPT-5` can vary
significantly depending on the nature of the request. Web search times also vary
depending on the size and content of the documents located by the search.

### Research Planning Agent

Analyzes research queries and creates comprehensive research strategies. Takes
an unstructured question and decomposes it into specific research aspects with
priorities, identifies expected source types, and defines success criteria.

*File: agents/research_planning.py*

```python
from .models import ResearchPlan
from .config import COMPLEX_REASONING_MODEL
from activities.invoke_model import invoke_model, InvokeModelRequest
from temporalio import workflow
from datetime import timedelta

RESEARCH_PLANNING_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are a research planning specialist who creates focused research strategies.

CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. Decompose the user's question into 3-7 key research aspects
2. Identify required sources and evidence types
3. Design a practical search strategy
4. Set clear success criteria

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- research_question: Clarified version of the original query
- key_aspects: Specific areas requiring investigation, each with:
  - aspect: The research area name
  - priority: 1-5 ranking (5 highest priority)

"""


async def plan_research(query: str) -> ResearchPlan:
    result = await workflow.execute_activity(
        invoke_model,
        InvokeModelRequest(
            model=COMPLEX_REASONING_MODEL,

        start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=300),
        summary="Planning research",
    )
    return result.response
```

### Query Generation Agent

Converts research plans into optimized web search queries. Creates 3-5 diverse
queries that target different information types (factual data, expert analysis,
case studies, recent news) with varied search styles and temporal modifiers.

*File: agents/research_query_generation.py*

```python
from .models import QueryPlan, ResearchPlan
from .config import EFFICIENT_PROCESSING_MODEL

QUERY_GENERATION_INSTRUCTIONS = """

2. Balance specificity with discoverability
3. Target different information types (factual, analytical, recent, historical)

    # Prepare input with research plan context
    plan_context = f"""

"""

    result = await workflow.execute_activity(

        start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=300),
        summary="Generating search queries",
    )

    return result.response
```

### Web Search Agent

Executes searches using OpenAI's web search tool and analyzes results.
Prioritizes authoritative sources, extracts key findings, assesses relevance,
and provides proper citations with reliability assessments.

*File: agents/research_web_search.py*

```python
from .models import SearchResult, SearchQuery
from .config import EFFICIENT_PROCESSING_MODEL
from activities.invoke_model import invoke_model, InvokeModelRequest

4. Provide proper citations and assess reliability

APPROACH:
- Focus on information directly relevant to the research question
- Extract specific facts, data points, and evidence
- Note conflicting information and limitations
- Flag questionable or unverified claims

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

        summary="Searching web for information",
    )
    return result.response
```

### Report Synthesis Agent

Directs the agent to synthesize all research findings into comprehensive,
well-cited reports. These should include structured narratives with executive
summaries, detailed analysis, key findings, confidence assessments, and
follow-up research questions.

*File: agents/research_report_synthesis.py*

```python
from typing import List
from temporalio import workflow
from datetime import timedelta
from .models import ResearchReport, ResearchPlan, SearchResult
from .config import COMPLEX_REASONING_MODEL

## Create the Workflow

The `DeepResearchWorkflow` orchestrates the four-phase research process with
built-in resilience and error handling:

First, planning and query generation agents are run sequentially. Then, the
workflow executes searches concurrently. For robustness, the workflow continues
with partial results if some searches fail. Finally, the report synthesis agent
pulls together the findings into a comprehensive report.
