 The process of identifying and resolving conflicts that arise when different parts of a system have inconsistent data or operations.
 Conflicts can occur when Namespaces and replicas have diverging states.
 These are often due to network issues, concurrent updates, or replication delays.
 Conflict resolution ensures that all elements eventually converge to a consistent and correct state, minimizing data inconsistency and system disruption.
