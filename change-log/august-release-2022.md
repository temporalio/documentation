- We have added a [Getting started with Temporal Cloud guide](/cloud/how-to-get-started-with-temporal-cloud)!
- There are also guides to [managing certificates](/cloud/how-to-manage-certificates-in-temporal-cloud) and [managing Namespaces](/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud) in Temporal Cloud.
- Blog has moved from docs.temporal.io to [temporal.io/blog](https://temporal.io/blog).
- A new [KB articles](https://docs.temporal.io/kb) section that introduces a “general knowledge base article” information archetype to Temporal’s Platform documentation.
  This information archetype aims to answer questions such as “what is an aggregation of things of this theme?”, “what are similarities and differences between things”, “how to do something that bridges Temporal and other tech stacks”, “how to do something that is less common”, etc…
