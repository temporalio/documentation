You can run a [Temporal Cluster](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster) for development and testing purposes in various ways.
This article aims to maintain a comprehensive list of them.

<!-- truncate -->

- [Docker](#docker-compose): Using Docker Compose simplifies developing your Temporal Application.
- [Gitpod](#gitpod): One-click deployments are available for Go and TypeScript.
- [Helm charts](#helm-charts): Deploying a Cluster to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an easy way to test the system and develop Temporal Applications.
- [Render](#render): Our [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) experience has been translated to Render's Blueprint format for an alternative cloud connection.
- [Temporalite](#temporalite): This distribution of Temporal runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies.

**For information on deploying a [production environment](/server/production-deployment), see the [Temporal Cloud](/cloud) documentation.**

#### Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose and Temporal Cluster Docker images to quickly install and run a Temporal Cluster locally.

**Prerequisites**

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).

**Clone the repo and run Docker Compose**

The following steps start and run a Temporal Cluster using the default configuration.

1. Clone the [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
   ```
2. Change to the directory for the project.
   ```bash
   cd docker-compose
   ```
3. From your project directory, start your application.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

**Results**: You should have Temporal Cluster running at `http://127.0.0.1:7233` and the Temporal Web UI at [`http://127.0.0.1:8080`](http://127.0.0.1:8080/namespaces/default/workflows).

To try other configurations (different dependencies and databases), or to try a custom Docker image, follow the [temporalio/docker-compose README](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose/blob/main/README.md).

#### Gitpod

You can run a Temporal Cluster and develop Temporal Applications in your browser using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

One-click deployments are available for the [temporalio/samples-go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go) repo and the [temporalio/samples-typescript](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript) repo.

A one-click deployment starts a Temporal Cluster using a Temporal Cluster Docker image, starts a Worker Process, and starts one of the application's sample Workflows.

A one-click deployment can take up to a full minute to get fully up and running.
When it is running, you can customize the application samples.

#### Helm charts

Use [Temporal Helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts) to deploy the Temporal Server to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.

Deploying the Temporal Cluster with Helm is not recommended for a production environment, but it is a great way to test the system while developing Workflows.

#### Render

[temporal-render-simple](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-render-simple) translates our docker-compose to Render by using the Auto-Setup Docker image.
We do not recommend using this technique for production because all four Temporal internal services (Frontend, Matching, History, and Worker) are run in one process, but the benefit is one-click deployments.

#### Temporalite

Temporalite is a distribution of Temporal that runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies.
It supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.

**Prerequisites**

Temporalite requires Go 1.18 or later.

**Build and start Temporalite**

The following steps start and run a Temporal Cluster.

1. Build from source by using `go install`.
   ```bash
   go install github.com/temporalio/temporalite/cmd/temporalite@latest
   ```
2. Start Temporalite by using the `start` command.
   ```bash
   temporalite start --namespace default
   ```
   Replace `default` with your [Namespace Name](/cloud/#temporal-cloud-namespace-name).

**Results**: You should have Temporal Cluster running at `http://127.0.0.1:7233` and the Temporal Web UI at [`http://127.0.0.1:8233`](http://127.0.0.1:8233/namespaces/default/workflows).

<!-- For macOS users, if you receive the `error setting up schema: stat /Users/<user_name>/Library/Application Support/temporalite/db:` error, then create the folders `temporalite/db` in your `Application Support` library. -->
