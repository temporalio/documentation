Running into limits can cause unexpected failures, so be mindful when you design your systems.
Here is a list of many hard (error) or soft (warn) limits that you could encounter while using the Temporal Platform.

<!-- truncate -->

- **gRPC**: gRPC has a limit of 4 MB for [each message received](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/v1.36.2/include/grpc/impl/codegen/grpc_types.h#L466).
- **Event batch size**: The `DefaultTransactionSizeLimit` limit is [4 MB](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/1363).
  This is the largest transaction size we allow for Event Histories to be persisted.
  - This is configurable with `TransactionSizeLimit`, if you know what you are doing.
- **Blob size limit** for incoming payloads (including Workflow context; _[source](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/frontend/service.go#L133-L134)_):
  - We warn at 512 KB: [`Blob size exceeds limit.`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/fee1c43823699e90b330680a8efeb9d8dbee8cf3/common/util.go#L568)
  - We error at 2 MB: `ErrBlobSizeExceedsLimit: Blob data size exceeds limit.`
  - This is configurable with [`BlobSizeLimitError` and `BlobSizeLimitWarn`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L378-L379), if you know what you are doing.
- **History total size limit** (leading to a terminated Workflow Execution):
  - We warn at 10 MB: `history size exceeds warn limit.`
  - We error at 50 MB: [`history size exceeds error limit.`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/workflowExecutionContext.go#L1204)
  - This is configurable with [`HistorySizeLimitError` and `HistorySizeLimitWarn`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L380-L381), if you know what you are doing.
- **History total count limit** (leading to a terminated Workflow Execution):

  - We warn at 10,000 Events: `history size exceeds warn limit.`
  - We error at 50,000 Events: [`history size exceeds error limit.`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/workflowExecutionContext.go#L1204)

  - This is configurable with [`HistoryCountLimitError` and `HistoryCountLimitWarn`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L382-L383), if you know what you are doing.

  - We fail the following Commands at 50,000 Events for OSS and 2,000 Events for Cloud:
    - `ScheduleActivityTask`
    - `SignalExternalWorkflowExecution`
    - `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution`
    - `StartChildWorkflowExecution`
