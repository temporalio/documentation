Archiver","tags":["how-to"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTo archive data with a given provider, using the [Archival](/concepts/what-is-archival) feature, Temporal must have a corresponding Archiver component installed.\nThe platform does not limit you to the existing providers.\nTo use a provider that is not currently supported, you can create your own Archiver.\n\n#### Create a new package\n\nThe first step is to create a new package for your implementation in [/common/archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver).\nCreate a directory in the archiver folder and arrange the structure to look like the following:\n\n```\ntemporal/common/archiver\n  - filestore/                      -- Filestore implementation\n  - provider/\n      - provider.go                 -- Provider of archiver instances\n  - yourImplementation/\n      - historyArchiver.go          -- HistoryArchiver implementation\n      - historyArchiver_test.go     -- Unit tests for HistoryArchiver\n      - visibilityArchiver.go       -- VisibilityArchiver implementations\n      - visibilityArchiver_test.go  -- Unit tests for VisibilityArchiver\n```\n\n#### Archiver interfaces\n\nNext, define objects that implement the [HistoryArchiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/interface.go#L80) and the [VisibilityArchiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/interface.go#L121) interfaces.\n\nThe objects should live in `historyArchiver.go` and `visibilityArchiver.go`, respectively.\n\n#### Update provider\n\nUpdate the `GetHistoryArchiver` and `GetVisibilityArchiver` methods of the `archiverProvider` object in the [/common/archiver/provider/provider.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/provider/provider.go) file so that it knows how to create an instance of your archiver.\n\n#### Add configs\n\nAdd configs for your archiver to the `config/development.yaml` file and then modify the [HistoryArchiverProvider](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/config/config.go#L376) and [VisibilityArchiverProvider](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/config/config.go#L393) structs in `/common/common/config.go` accordingly.\n\n#### Custom archiver FAQ\n\n**If my custom Archive method can automatically be retried by the caller, how can I record and access progress between retries?**\n\nHandle this situation by using `ArchiverOptions`.\nHere is an example:\n\n```go\nfunc(a * Archiver) Archive(ctx context.Context, URI string, request * ArchiveRequest, opts...ArchiveOption) error {\n    featureCatalog: = GetFeatureCatalog(opts...) // this function is defined in options.go\n    var progress progress\n    // Check if the feature for recording progress is enabled.\n    if featureCatalog.ProgressManager != nil {\n        if err: = featureCatalog.ProgressManager.LoadProgress(ctx, & prevProgress);\n        err != nil {\n            // log some error message and return error if needed.\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Your archiver implementation...\n\n    // Record current progress\n    if featureCatalog.ProgressManager != nil {\n        if err: = featureCatalog.ProgressManager.RecordProgress(ctx, progress);\n        err != nil {\n            // log some error message and return error if needed.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**If my `Archive` method encounters an error that is non-retryable, how do I indicate to the caller that it should not retry?**\n\n```go\nfunc(a * Archiver) Archive(ctx context.Context, URI string, request * ArchiveRequest, opts...ArchiveOption) error {\n    featureCatalog: = GetFeatureCatalog(opts...) // this function is defined in options.go\n\n    err: = youArchiverImpl()\n\n    if nonRetryableErr(err) {\n        if featureCatalog.NonRetryableError != nil {\n            return featureCatalog.NonRetryableError() // when the caller gets this error type back it will not retry anymore.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**How does my history archiver implementation read history?**\n\nThe archiver package provides a utility called [HistoryIterator](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/historyIterator.go) which is a wrapper of [ExecutionManager](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/persistence/dataInterfaces.go#L1014).\n`HistoryIterator` is more simple than the `HistoryManager`, which is available in the BootstrapContainer, so archiver implementations can choose to use it when reading Workflow histories.\nSee the [historyIterator.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/historyIterator.go) file for more details.\nUse the [filestore historyArchiver implementation](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/filestore) as an example.\n\n**Should my archiver define its own error types?**\n\nEach archiver is free to define and return its own errors.\nHowever, many common errors that exist between archivers are already defined in [common/archiver/constants.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/constants.go).\n\n**Is there a generic query syntax for the visibility archiver?**\n\nCurrently, no.\nBut this is something we plan to do in the future.\nAs for now, try to make your syntax similar to the one used by our advanced list Workflow API.\n\n- [s3store](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/s3store#visibility-query-syntax)\n-

Supported providers are S3, GCloud, and the local file system.\n- **URI**: Specifies which provider should be used. The system uses the URI schema and path to make the determination.\n\nTake the following steps to set up Archival:\n\n1. [Set up the provider](#providers) of your choice.\n2. [Configure Archival](#configuration).\n3. [Create a Namespace](#namespace-creation) that uses a valid URI and has Archival enabled.\n\n#### Providers\n\nTemporal directly supports several providers:\n\n- **Local file system**: The [filestore archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/filestore) is used to archive data in the file system of whatever host the Temporal server is running on. This provider is used mainly for local installations and testing and should not be relied on for production environments.\n- **Google Cloud**: The [gcloud archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/gcloud) is used to connect and archive data with [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/storage).\n- **S3**: The [s3store archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/s3store) is used to connect and archive data with [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3).\n- **Custom**: If you want to use a provider that is not currently supported, you can [create your own archiver](/clusters/how-to-create-a-custom-archiver) to support it.\n\nMake sure that you save the provider's storage location URI in a place where you can reference it later, because it is passed as a parameter when you [create a Namespace](#namespace-creation).\n\n#### Configuration\n\nArchival configuration is defined in the [`config/development.yaml`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/config/development.yaml#L93) file.\nLet's look at an example configuration:\n\n```yaml\n# Cluster level Archival config\narchival:\n  # Event History configuration\n  history:\n    # Archival is enabled at the cluster level\n    state: \"enabled\"\n    enableRead: true\n    # Namespaces can use either the local filestore provider or the Google Cloud provider\n    provider:\n      filestore:\n        fileMode: \"0666\"\n        dirMode: \"0766\"\n      gstorage:\n        credentialsPath: \"/tmp/gcloud/keyfile.json\"\n\n# Default values for a Namespace if none are provided at creation\nnamespaceDefaults:\n  # Archival defaults\n  archival:\n    # Event History defaults\n    history:\n      state: \"enabled\"\n      # New Namespaces will default to the local provider\n      URI: \"file:///tmp/temporal_archival/development\"\n```\n\nYou can disable Archival by setting `archival.history.state` and `namespaceDefaults.archival.history.state` to `\"disabled\"`.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\narchival:\n  history:\n    state: \"disabled\"\n\nnamespaceDefaults:\n  archival:\n    history:\n      state: \"disabled\"\n```\n\nThe following table showcases acceptable values for each configuration and what purpose they serve.\n\n| Config                                         | Acceptable values                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                  |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `archival.history.state`                       | `enabled`, `disabled`                                                              | Must be `enabled` to use the Archival feature with any Namespace in the cluster.                                             |\n| `archival.history.enableRead`                  | `true`, `false`                                                                    | Must be `true` to read from the archived Event History.                                                                      |\n| `archival.history.provider`                    | Sub provider configs are `filestore`, `gstorage`, `s3`, or `your_custom_provider`. | Default config specifies `filestore`.                                                                                        |\n| `archival.history.provider.filestore.fileMode` | File permission string                                                             | File permissions of the archived files.

however there is no guarantee that there is compatibility between _any_ two non-consecutive versions.\n\nWhen upgrading your Temporal Server version, ensure that you upgrade sequentially.\nFor example, when upgrading from v1.n.x, always upgrade to v1.n+1.x (or the next available version) and so on until you get to the required version.\n\nThe Temporal Server upgrade updates or rewrites the old version data with the format introduced in the newer version.\nBecause Temporal Server guarantees backward compatibility between two consecutive minor versions, and because older versions of the code are eventually removed from the code base, skipping versions when upgrading might cause older formats to become unrecognizable.\nIf the old format of the data can't be read to be rewritten to the new format, the upgrades fail.\n\nCheck the [Temporal Server releases](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases) and follow these releases in order.\nYou can skip patch versions; use the latest patch of a minor version when upgrading.\n\nAlso be aware that each upgrade requires the History Service to load all Shards and update the Shard metadata, so allow approximately 10 minutes on each version for these processes to complete before upgrading to the next version.\n\nUse one of the upgrade tools to upgrade your database schema to be compatible with the Temporal Server version being upgraded to.\n\nIf you are using a schema tools version prior to 1.8.0, we strongly recommend _never_ using the \"dryrun\" (`-y`, or `--dryrun`) options in any of your schema update commands.\nUsing this option might lead to potential loss of data, as when using it will create a new database and drop your\nexisting one.\nThis flag was removed in the 1.8.0 release.\n\n### Upgrade Cassandra schema\n\nIf you are using Cassandra for your Cluster's persistence, use the `temporal-cassandra-tool` to upgrade both the default and visibility schemas.\n\n**Example default schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\ntemporal_v1.2.1 $ temporal-cassandra-tool \\\n   --tls \\\n   --tls-ca-file <...> \\\n   --user <cassandra-user> \\\n   --password <cassandra-password> \\\n   --endpoint <cassandra.example.com> \\\n   --keyspace temporal \\\n   --timeout 120 \\\n   update \\\n   --schema-dir ./schema/cassandra/temporal/versioned\n```\n\n**Example visibility schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\ntemporal_v1.2.1 $ temporal-cassandra-tool \\\n   --tls \\\n   --tls-ca-file <...> \\\n   --user <cassandra-user> \\\n   --password <cassandra-password> \\\n   --endpoint <cassandra.example.com> \\\n   --keyspace temporal_visibility \\\n   --timeout 120 \\\n   update \\\n   --schema-dir ./schema/cassandra/visibility/versioned\n```\n\n### Upgrade MySQL / PostgreSQL schema\n\nIf you are using MySQL or PostgreSQL use the `temporal-sql-tool`, which works similarly to the `temporal-cassandra-tool`.\n\nRefer to this [Makefile](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.4.1/Makefile#L367-L383) for context.\n\n#### PostgreSQL\n\n**Example default schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\n./temporal-sql-tool \\\n\t--tls \\\n\t--tls-enable-host-verification \\\n\t--tls-cert-file <path to your client cert> \\\n\t--tls-key-file <path to your client key> \\\n\t--tls-ca-file <path to your CA> \\\n\t--ep localhost -p 5432 -u temporal -pw temporal --pl postgres --db temporal update-schema -d ./schema/postgresql/v96/temporal/versioned\n```\n\n**Example visibility schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\n./temporal-sql-tool \\\n\t--tls \\\n\t--tls-enable-host-verification \\\n\t--tls-cert-file <path to your client cert> \\\n\t--tls-key-file <path to your client key> \\\n\t--tls-ca-file <path to your CA> \\\n\t--ep localhost -p 5432 -u temporal -pw temporal --pl postgres --db temporal_visibility update-schema -d ./schema/postgresql/v96/visibility/versioned\n```\n\n#### MySQL\n\n**Example default schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\n./temporal-sql-tool \\\n\t--tls \\\n\t--tls-enable-host-verification \\\n\t--tls-cert-file <path to your client cert> \\\n\t--tls-key-file <path to your client key> \\\n\t--tls-ca-file <path to your CA> \\\n\t--ep localhost -p 3036 -u root -pw root --pl mysql --db temporal update-schema -d ./schema/mysql/v57/temporal/versioned/\n```\n\n**Example visibility schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\n./temporal-sql-tool \\\n\t--tls \\\n\t--tls-enable-host-verification \\\n\t--tls-cert-file <path to your client cert> \\\n\t--tls-key-file <path to your client key> \\\n\t--tls-ca-file <path to your CA> \\\n\t--ep localhost -p 3036 -u root -pw root --pl mysql --db temporal_visibility update-schema -d ./schema/mysql/v57/visibility/versioned/\n```\n\n### Roll-out technique\n\nWe recommend preparing a staging Cluster and then do the following to verify the upgrade is successful:\n\n1. Create some simulation load on the staging cluster.\n2. Upgrade the database schema in the staging cluster.\n3. Wait and observe for a few minutes to verify that there is no unstable behavior from both the server and the simulation load logic.\n4. Upgrade the server.\n5.

another Workflow.\n\n- [How to start a Child Workflow Execution](/application-development/features#child-workflows)\n\nA Workflow Execution can be both a Parent and a Child Workflow Execution because any Workflow can spawn another Workflow.\n\n![Parent and Child Workflow Execution entity relationship](/diagrams/parent-child-workflow-execution-relationship.svg)\n\nA Parent Workflow Execution must await on the Child Workflow Execution to spawn.\nThe Parent can optionally await on the result of the Child Workflow Execution.\nConsider the Child's [Parent Close Policy](/concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy) if the Parent does not await on the result of the Child, which includes any use of Continue-As-New by the Parent.\n\nWhen a Parent Workflow Execution reaches a Closed status, the Cluster propagates Cancellation Requests or Terminations to Child Workflow Executions depending on the Child's Parent Close Policy.\n\nIf a Child Workflow Execution uses Continue-As-New, from the Parent Workflow Execution's perspective the entire chain of Runs is treated as a single execution.\n\n![Parent and Child Workflow Execution entity relationship with Continue As New](/diagrams/parent-child-workflow-execution-with-continue-as-new.svg)\n\n### When to use Child Workflows\n\n**Consider Workflow Execution Event History size limits.**\n\nAn individual Workflow Execution has an [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history) size limit, which imposes a couple of considerations for using Child Workflows.\n\nOn one hand, because Child Workflow Executions have their own Event Histories, they are often used to partition large workloads into smaller chunks.\nFor example, a single Workflow Execution does not have enough space in its Event History to spawn 100,000 [Activity Executions](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution).\nBut a Parent Workflow Execution can spawn 1,000 Child Workflow Executions that each spawn 1,000 Activity Executions to achieve a total of 1,000,000 Activity Executions.\n\nHowever, because a Parent Workflow Execution Event History contains [Events](/concepts/what-is-an-event) that correspond to the status of the Child Workflow Execution, a single Parent should not spawn more than 1,000 Child Workflow Executions.\n\nIn general, however, Child Workflow Executions result in more overall Events recorded in Event Histories than Activities.\nBecause each entry in an Event History is a _cost_ in terms of compute resources, this could become a factor in very large workloads.\nTherefore, we recommend starting with a single Workflow implementation that uses Activities until there is a clear need for Child Workflows.\n\n**Consider each Child Workflow Execution as a separate service.**\n\nBecause a Child Workflow Execution can be processed by a completely separate set of [Workers](/concepts/what-is-a-worker) than the Parent Workflow Execution, it can act as an entirely separate service.\nHowever, this also means that a Parent Workflow Execution and a Child Workflow Execution do not share any local state.\nAs all Workflow Executions, they can communicate only via asynchronous [Signals](/concepts/what-is-a-signal).\n\n**Consider that a single Child Workflow Execution can represent a single resource.**\n\nAs all Workflow Executions, a Child Workflow Execution can create a one to one mapping with a resource.\nFor example, a Workflow that manages host upgrades could spawn a Child Workflow Execution per host.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin","title":"What is a ClaimMapper Plugin?","description":"The Claim Mapper component is a pluggable component that extracts Claims from JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).","label":"Claim Mapper","tags":["term"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nThe Claim Mapper component is a pluggable component that extracts Claims from JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).\n\nThis process is achieved with the method `GetClaims`, which translates `AuthInfo` structs from the caller into `Claims` about the caller's roles within Temporal.\n\nA `Role` (within Temporal) is a bit mask that combines one or more of the role constants.\nIn the following example, the role is assigned constants that allow the caller to read and write information.\n\n```go\nrole := authorization.RoleReader | authorization.RoleWriter\n```\n\n`GetClaims` is customizable and can be modified with the `temporal.WithClaimMapper` server option.\nTemporal also offers a default JWT `ClaimMapper` for your use.\n\nA typical approach is for `ClaimMapper` to interpret custom `Claims` from a caller's JWT, such as membership in groups, and map them to Temporal roles for the user.\nThe subject information from the caller's mTLS certificate can also be a parameter in determining roles.\n\n#### `AuthInfo`\n\n`AuthInfo` is a struct that is passed to `GetClaims`. `AuthInfo` contains an authorization token extracted from the `authorization` header of the gRPC request.\n\n`AuthInfo` includes a pointer to the `pkix.Name` struct.\nThis struct contains an [x.509](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/7.5?topic=certificates-distinguished-names) Distinguished Name from the caller's mTLS certificate.\n\n#### `Claims`\n\n`Claims` is a struct that contains information about permission claims granted to the caller.\n\n`Authorizer` assumes that the caller has been properly authenticated, and trusts the `Claims` when making an authorization decision.\n\n#### Default JWT ClaimMapper\n\nTemporal offers a default JWT `ClaimMapper` that extracts the information needed to form Temporal `Claims`.\nThis plugin requires a public key to validate digital signatures.\n\nTo get an instance of the default JWT `ClaimMapper`, call `NewDefaultJWTClaimMapper` and provide it with the following:\n\n- a `TokenKeyProvider` instance\n- a `config.Authorization` pointer\n- a logger\n\nThe code for the default `ClaimMapper` can also be used to build a custom `ClaimMapper`.\n\n#### Token key provider\n\nA `TokenKeyProvider` obtains public keys from specified issuers' URIs that adhere to a specific format.\nThe default JWT `ClaimMapper` uses this component to obtain and refresh public keys over time.\n\nTemporal provides an `rsaTokenKeyProvider`.\nThis component dynamically obtains public keys that follow the [JWKS format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).\n`rsaTokenKeyProvider` uses only the `RSAKey` and `Close` methods.\n\n```go\nprovider := authorization.NewRSAKeyProvider(cfg)\n```\n\n:::note\n\n`KeySourceURIs` are the HTTP endpoints that return public keys of token issuers in the [JWKS format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).\n`RefreshInterval` defines how frequently keys should be refreshed.\nFor example, [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) exposes endpoints such as `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/.well-known/jwks.json`.\n\n:::\n\nBy default, \"permissions\" is used to name the `permissionsClaimName` value.\n\nConfigure the plugin with `config.Config.Global.Authorization.JWTKeyProvider`.\n\n#### JSON Web Token format\n\nThe default JWT `ClaimMapper` expects authorization tokens to be formatted as follows:\n\n```\nBearer <token>\n```\n\nThe Permissions Claim in the JWT Token is expected to be a collection of Individual Permission Claims.\nEach Individual Permission Claim must be formatted as follows:\n\n```\n<namespace> : <permission>\n```\n\nThese permissions are then converted into Temporal roles for the caller.\nThis can be one of Temporal's four values:\n\n- read\n- write\n- worker\n- admin\n\nMultiple permissions for the same Namespace are overridden by the `ClaimMapper`.\n\n##### Example of a payload for the default JWT ClaimMapper\n\n```\n{\n   \"permissions\":[\n      \"system:read\",\n      \"namespace1:write\"\n   ],\n   \"aud\":[\n      \"audience\"\n   ],\n   \"exp\":1630295722,\n

If any part of it is not serializable as JSON (for example, a Date—see [JSON data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types)), an error will be thrown.\n\nThe default converter also supports decoding binary Protobufs.\n\n## Custom Data Converter\n\nApplications can create their own custom Data Converters to alter the format (for example using [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) instead of JSON) or add compression or encryption.\n\nTo use a custom Data Converter, provide it in the following contexts:\n\n- The Client and Worker in the SDKs you use.\n- Temporal Web via [`tctl data-converter web`](/tctl-v1/dataconverter#web) (for displaying decoded data in the Web UI).\n- `tctl` via [`--data-converter-plugin`](/tctl-next/#--data-converter-plugin) (for displaying decoded headers in `tctl` output).\n\nCustom Data Converters are not applied to all data:\n\n- `searchAttributes` are always encoded with JSON.\n- Headers are not encoded by the SDK (the one exception will be—when implemented—the SDK [running OTel baggage through custom Codecs](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/514)).\n\nA custom Data Converter has three parts:\n\n- [Payload Converter](#payload-converter)\n- [Payload Codec](#payload-codec)\n- [Failure Converter](#failure-converter)\n\n### Payload Converter\n\nSome SDKs have the concept of a Payload Converter that's part of the Data Converter and does the conversion from a value to a Payload and back.\n\n### Payload Codec\n\nIn [TypeScript](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/data-converters#custom-data-converter), [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#PayloadCodec), and [Python](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.converter.DataConverter.html), data conversion happens in two stages:\n\n1. A Payload Converter converts a value into a [`Payload`](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.common.v1.Payload).\n2. A Payload Codec transforms an array of Payloads (for example, a list of Workflow arguments) into another array of Payloads.\n\nThe Payload Codec is an optional step that happens between the wire and the Payload Converter:\n\n```\nTemporal Server <--> Wire <--> Payload Codec <--> Payload Converter <--> User code\n```\n\nCommon Payload Codec transformations are compression and encryption.\n\nIn codec implementations, we recommended running the function (whether it be compressing, encrypting, etc) on the entire input Payload, and putting the result in a new Payload's `data` field. That way, the input Payload's headers are preserved. See, for example:\n\n- [`ZlibCodec`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/706516c7077ba2e9b40304aeddbed47e25b2a68f/converter/codec.go#L77-L105) in the Go SDK\n- [Encryption Data Converter](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/15be864c80d4d983ebb8a8fbd3fa5263bcef6930/encryption/data_converter.go#L100-L126) in Go's encryption sample\n\nTo view data that's been converted by a codec in the Web UI and tctl, use a [Codec Server](/security#codec-server).\n\n#### Encryption\n\nDoing encryption in a custom Data Converter ensures that all application data is encrypted during the following actions:\n\n- Being sent to/from Temporal Server.\n- Moving inside Temporal Server.\n- Stored by Temporal Server.\n\nThen data exists unencrypted in memory only on the Client and in the Worker Process that is executing Workflows and Activities on hosts that the application developer controls.\n\nOur encryption samples use AES GCM with 256-bit keys:\n\n- [TypeScript sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/encryption)\n- [Go sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/encryption)\n- [Python sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/tree/main/encryption)\n- [Java sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/main/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/encryptedpayloads)\n\n### Failure Converter\n\nA Failure Converter converts error objects to proto [Failures](/temporal#failure) and back.\n\nThe default Failure Converter copies error messages and stack traces as plain text.\nIf your errors may contain sensitive information, you can encrypt the message and stack trace by configuring the default Failure Converter to use your [Payload Codec](#payload-codec), in which case it will move your `message` and `stack_trace` fields to a Payload that's run through your codec.\n\nYou can make a custom Failure Converter, but if you use multiple SDKs, you'd have to implement the same logic in each.\n\n- TypeScript: [`DefaultFailureConverter`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.DefaultFailureConverter)\n- Go: [`GetDefaultFailureConverter`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.18.0/temporal#GetDefaultFailureConverter)\n- Python: [`DefaultFailureConverter`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.converter.DefaultFailureConverter.html)\n- Java: _Not yet supported_\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-a-failure.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-failure.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-failure","title":"What is a Failure?","description":"Temporal Failures are representations of various types of errors that occur in the system.","label":"Failure","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTemporal Failures are representations (in the SDKs and Event History) of various types of errors that occur in the system.\n\n- KB article: [Temporal Failures](/kb/failures)\n\nFailure handling is an essential part of development.\nFor more information, including the difference between application-level and platform-level failures, see [Handling Failure From First Principles](https://dominik-tornow.medium.com/handling-failures-from-first-principles-1ed976b1b869).\nFor the practical application of those concepts in Temporal, see [Failure Handling in Practice](https://temporal.io/blog/failure-handling-in-practice).\n\nFor languages that throw (or raise) errors (or exceptions), throwing an error that is not a Temporal Failure from a Workflow fails the Workflow Task (and the Task will be retried until it succeeds), whereas throwing a Temporal Failure (or letting a Temporal Failure propagate from Temporal calls, like an [Activity Failure](/kb/failures#activity-failure) from an Activity call) fails the Workflow Execution.\nFor more information, see [Application Failure](/kb/failures#application-failure).\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-a-frontend-service.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-frontend-service.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-frontend-service","title":"What is a Frontend Service?","description":"The Frontend Service is a stateless gateway service that exposes a strongly typed Proto API.

History Shards represents the number of concurrent database operations that can occur for a Cluster.\nThis means that the number of History Shards in a Temporal Cluster plays a significant role in the performance of your Temporal Application.\n\nBefore integrating a database, the total number of History Shards for the Temporal Cluster must be chosen and set in the Cluster's configuration (see [persistence](/references/configuration#persistence)).\nAfter the Shard count is configured and the database integrated, the total number of History Shards for the Cluster cannot be changed.\n\nIn theory, a Temporal Cluster can operate with an unlimited number of History Shards, but each History Shard adds compute overhead to the Cluster.\nTemporal Clusters have operated successfully using anywhere from 1 to 128K History Shards, with each Shard responsible for tens of thousands of Workflow Executions.\nOne Shard is useful only in small scale setups designed for testing, while 128k Shards is useful only in very large scale production environments.\nThe correct number of History Shards for any given Cluster depends entirely on the Temporal Application that it is supporting and

[Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) that spawns it.\n\nSome Activity Executions are very short-living and do not need the queuing semantic, flow control, rate limiting, and routing capabilities.\nFor this case, Temporal supports the Local Activity feature.\n\nThe main benefit of Local Activities is that they use less Temporal Cluster resources (for example, fewer History events) and have much lower latency overhead (because no need to roundtrip to the Cluster) compared to normal Activity Executions.\nHowever, Local Activities are subject to shorter durations and a lack of rate limiting.\n\nConsider using Local Activities for functions that are the following:\n\n- can be implemented in the same binary as the Workflow that calls them.\n- do not require global rate limiting.\n- do not require routing to a specific Worker or Worker pool.\n- no longer than a few seconds, inclusive of retries.\n\nIf it takes longer than 80% of the Workflow Task Timeout (which is 10 seconds by default), the Worker will ask the Cluster to create a new Workflow Task to extend the \"lease\" for processing the Local Activity.\nThe Worker will continue doing so until the Local Activity has completed.\nThis is called Workflow Task Heartbeating.\nThe drawbacks of long-running Local Activities are:\n\n- Each new Workflow Task results in 3 more Events in History.\n- The Workflow won't get notified of new events like Signals and completions until the next Workflow Task Heartbeat.\n- New Commands created by the Workflow concurrently with the Local Activity will not be sent to the Cluster until either the Local Activity completes or the next Workflow Task Heartbeat.\n\nUsing a Local Activity without understanding its limitations can cause various production

of isolation within the Temporal Platform.\n\nA single Namespace is still multi-tenant.\n\n### Usage\n\nNamespaces are created on the Temporal Cluster, and provide a range of controls to achieve isolation on Workflow Executions.\n\n- Namespaces are a mechanism for resource isolation. Heavy traffic from one Namespace will not impact other Namespaces running on the same Cluster.\n  For example, you can use Namespaces to match the development lifecycle by having separate `dev` and `prod` Namespaces.\n- If no other Namespace is specified, the Temporal Cluster uses the Namespace \"default\" for all Temporal SDKs and tctl.\n  See the [Registration](#registration) section for details.\n- Namespaces created on self-hosted Temporal Clusters are case-sensitive. For example, `foo` and `Foo` are two different Namespaces.\n  On Temporal Cloud, Namespaces are case-insensitive, and we recommend using lowercase for Namespace names to avoid potential issues.\n- **Membership**: [Task Queue](/concepts/what-is-a-task-queue) names and [Workflow Ids](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id) must all correspond to a specific Namespace.\n  For example, when a Workflow Execution is spawned, it does so within a specific Namespace.\n- **Uniqueness**: Temporal guarantees a unique Workflow Id within a Namespace.\n  Workflow Executions may have the same Workflow Id if they are in different Namespaces.\n- **Namespace Configuration**: Various configuration options like the [Retention Period](/concepts/what-is-a-retention-period) and the [Archival](/concepts/what-is-archival) destination are configured per Namespace through a special CRUD API or through [`tctl`](/tctl-v1/namespace).\n\n### Registration\n\nRegistering a Namespace creates the Namespace on the Temporal Cluster.\nWhen you register your Namespace, you must also set the [Retention Period](/concepts/what-is-a-retention-period) for the Namespace.\n\nOn Temporal Cloud, use the [Temporal Cloud UI](/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud) or [tcld commands](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to create and manage Namespaces.\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you can register your Namespaces using tctl (recommended) or programmatically using APIs. Note that these APIs and tctl commands will not work with Temporal Cloud.\n\nAll SDKs require a Namespace on the Temporal Cluster (or Temporal Cloud) for their Client calls. If not set using Client options, the Workflow Client API looks for the `default` Namespace. If there is no default Namespace registered with your Temporal Cluster (or Temporal Cloud), all calls will throw errors.\nYou must register your Namespace with the Temporal Cluster (or Temporal Cloud) before setting it in your Client.\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you can register your Namespaces in the following ways:\n\n- In your Cluster setup, create your Namespaces, including the default, in your setup script.\n  For example:\n\n  - If deploying through Docker Compose or using the [auto-setup image](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-builds/blob/main/docker/auto-setup.sh) in a custom Docker Compose application, the Namespace \"default\" is created, through the auto-setup script.\n  - If deploying through the [Temporal Helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts), you can create the \"default\" Namespace by using tctl; for example, `tctl --namespace default namespace register`.\n\n- Use the `tctl namespace register` command with the `--retention` modfiier to register your Namespaces, one at a time, and set the Retention Period on each.\n\n  - [How to register a new Namespace using tctl](/tctl-v1/namespace#register)\n  - [How to register a new Namespace using SDK](/app-dev-context/namespaces)\n\n- In your Client program, register your Namespace using `RegisterNamespaceRequest` API available in all the SDKs.\n\nNote that registering a Namespace takes up to 15 seconds to complete. Ensure that you are waiting for this process to complete before making calls to the Namespace.\n\n### Manage Namespaces\n\nUse a custom [Authorizer](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin) on your Frontend Service in the Temporal Cluster to set restrictions on who can create, update, or deprecate Namespaces.\n\nOn Temporal Cloud, use the [Temporal Cloud UI](/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud) or [tcld commands](/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to manage Namespaces.\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you can manage your registered Namespaces using tctl (recommended) or programmatically using APIs. Note that these APIs and tctl commands will not work with Temporal Cloud.\n\n- Update information and configuration for a registered Namespace on your Temporal Cluster:\n\n  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace update`](/tctl-v1/namespace#update)\n  - Use the [`UpdateNamespace` API](/app-dev-context/namespaces) to update configuration on a Namespace.\n\n- Get details for a registered Namespace on your Temporal Cluster:\n\n  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace describe`](/tctl-v1/namespace#describe)\n  - Use the [`DescribeNamespace` API](/app-dev-context/namespaces) to return information and configuration details for a registered Namespace.\n\n- Get details for all registered Namespaces on your Temporal Cluster:\n\n  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace list`](/tctl-v1/namespace#list)\n  - Use the [`ListNamespace` API](/app-dev-context/namespaces) to return information and configuration details for all registered Namespaces on your Temporal Cluster.\n\n- Deprecate a Namespace: The [`DeprecateNamespace` API](/app-dev-context/namespaces) updates the state of a registered Namespace to \"DEPRECATED\". Once a Namespace is deprecated, you cannot start new Workflow Executions on it. All existing and running Workflow Executions on a deprecated Namespace will continue to run.\n\n- Delete a Namespace: Deletes a Namespace and all Workflow Executions on the Namespace. Note that this API is supported for Temporal Server version 1.17 and later.\n- With tctl: [`tctl namespace delete`](/tctl-next/namespace#delete). Note that this feature is only available in the [tctl v2.0.0-beta](/tctl-next/namespace#delete).\n- Use the [`DeleteNamespace` API](/app-dev-context/namespaces) to delete a registered Namespaces. All the running Workflow Executions on a deleted Namespace are also deleted.\n\n### Setting\n\nSet Namespaces in your SDK Client to isolate your Workflow Executions to the Namespace.\nIf you do not set a Namespace, all Workflow Executions started using the Client will be associated with the \"default\" Namespace. This means, you must have a default Namespace called \"default\" registered with your Temporal Cluster.

When this happens an error is returned.\n  - Setting the value to 0 also means unlimited.\n  - Setting the value to 1 means a single execution attempt and no retries.\n  - Setting the value to a negative integer results in an error when the execution is invoked.\n- **Use case**: Use this attribute to ensure that retries do not continue indefinitely.\n  However, in the majority of cases, we recommend relying on the Workflow Execution Timeout, in the case of [Workflows](#workflow), or Schedule-To-Close Timeout, in the case of [Activities](#activity), to limit the total duration of retries instead of using this attribute.\n\n### Non-Retryable Errors\n\n- **Description**: Specifies errors that shouldn't be retried.\n  - **Default is none.**\n  - If one of those errors occurs, the [Activity Task Execution](#activity-task-execution) or [Workflow Execution](#workflow-execution) is not retried.\n  - The errors are matched against the `type` field of the [ApplicationFailure](/kb/failures#application-failure).\n- **Use case**: There may be errors that you know of that should not trigger a retry.\n  In this case, you can specify them such that, if they occur, the given execution is not retried.\n\n## Retry interval\n\nThe wait time before a retry is the _retry interval_. A retry interval is the smaller of two values:\n\n- The [Initial Interval](#initial-interval) multiplied by the [Backoff Coefficient](#backoff-coefficient) raised to the power of the number of retries.\n- The [Maximum Interval](#maximum-interval).\n\n## Event History\n\nThere are some subtle nuances to how Events are recorded to an Event History when a Retry Policy comes into play.\n\n- For an Activity Execution, the [ActivityTaskStarted](/concepts/what-is-an-event#activitytaskstarted) Event will not show up in the Workflow Execution Event History until the Activity Execution has completed or failed (having exhausted all retries).\n  This is to avoid filling the Event History with noise.\n  Use the Describe API to get a pending Activity Execution's attempt count.\n\n- For a Workflow Execution with a Retry Policy, if the Workflow Execution fails, the Workflow Execution will [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new) and the associated Event is written to the Event History.\n  The [WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew](/concepts/what-is-an-event#workflowexecutioncontinuedasnew) Event will have an \"initiator\" field that will specify the Retry Policy as the value and the new Run Id for the next retry attempt.\n  The new Workflow Execution is created immediately.\n  But the first Workflow Task won't be scheduled until the backoff duration is exhausted.\n

event.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-a-run-id.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-run-id.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-run-id","title":"What

`TemporalScheduledById` Search Attribute is added to the Workflow Execution.\n  The value is the Schedule Id.\n\n### Spec\n\nThe Schedule Spec describes when the Action is taken.\nThere are two kinds of Schedule Spec:\n\n- A simple interval, like \"every 30 minutes\" (aligned to start at the Unix epoch, and optionally including a phase offset).\n- A calendar-based expression, similar to the \"cron expressions\" supported by lots of software, including the older Temporal Cron feature.\n\nThese two kinds have multiple representations, depending on the interface or SDK you're using, but they all support the same features.\n\nIn tctl, for example, an interval is specified as a string like `45m` to mean every 45 minutes, or `6h/5h` to mean every 6 hours but at the start of the fifth hour within each period.\n\nIn tctl, a calendar expression can be specified as either a traditional cron string with five (or six or seven) positional fields, or as JSON with named fields:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"year\": \"2022\",\n  \"month\": \"Jan,Apr,Jul,Oct\",\n  \"dayOfMonth\": \"1,15\",\n  \"hour\": \"11-14\"\n}\n```\n\nThe following calendar JSON fields are available:\n\n- `year`\n- `month`\n- `dayOfMonth`\n- `dayOfWeek`\n- `hour`\n- `minute`\n- `second`\n- `comment`\n\nEach field can contain a comma-separated list of ranges (or the `*` wildcard), and each range can include a slash followed by a skip value.\nThe `hour`, `minute`, and `second` fields default to `0` while the others default to `*`, so you can describe many useful specs with only a few fields.\n\nFor `month`, names of months may be used instead of integers (case-insensitive, abbreviations permitted).\nFor `dayOfWeek`, day-of-week names may be used.\n\nThe `comment` field is optional and can be used to include a free-form description of the intent of the calendar spec, useful for complicated specs.\n\nNo matter which form you supply, calendar and interval specs are converted to canonical representations.\nWhat you see when you \"describe\" or \"list\" a Schedule might not look exactly like what you entered, but it has the same meaning.\n\nOther Spec features:\n\n**Multiple intervals/calendar expressions:** A Spec can have combinations of multiple intervals and/or calendar expressions to define a specific Schedule.\n\n**Time bounds:** Provide an absolute start or end time (or both) with a Spec to ensure that no actions are taken before the start time or after the end time.\n\n**Exclusions:** A Spec can contain exclusions in the form of zero or more calendar expressions.\nThis can be used to express scheduling like \"each Monday at noon except for holidays.\nYou'll have to provide your own set of exclusions and include it in each schedule; there are no pre-defined sets.\n(This feature isn't currently exposed in tctl or the Temporal Web UI.)\n\n**Jitter:** If given, a random offset between zero and the maximum jitter is added to each Action time (but bounded by the time until the next scheduled Action).\n\n**Time zones:** By default, calendar-based expressions are interpreted in UTC.\nTemporal recommends using UTC to avoid various surprising properties of time zones.\nIf you don't want to use UTC, you can provide the name of a time zone.\nThe time zone definition is loaded on the Temporal Server Worker Service from either disk or the fallback embedded in the binary.\n\nFor more operational control, embed the contents of the time zone database file in the Schedule Spec itself.\n(Note: this isn't currently exposed in tctl or the web UI.)\n\n### Pause\n\nA Schedule can be Paused.\nWhen a Schedule is Paused, the Spec has no effect.\nHowever, you can still force manual actions by using the [tctl schedule trigger](/tctl-v1/schedule#trigger) command.\n\nTo assist communication among developers and operators, a “notes” field can be updated on pause or resume to store an explanation for the current state.\n\n### Backfill\n\nA Schedule can be Backfilled.\nWhen a Schedule is Backfilled, all the Actions that would have been taken over a specified time period are taken now (in parallel if the `AllowAll` [Overlap Policy](#overlap-policy) is used; sequentially if `BufferAll` is used).\nYou might use this to fill in runs from a time period when the Schedule was paused due to an external condition that's now resolved, or a period before the Schedule was created.\n\n### Limit number of Actions\n\nA Schedule can be limited to a certain number of scheduled Actions (that is, not trigger immediately).\nAfter that it will act as if it were paused.\n\n### Policies\n\nA Schedule supports a set of Policies that enable customizing behavior.\n\n#### Overlap Policy\n\nThe Overlap Policy controls what happens when it is time to start a Workflow Execution but a previously started Workflow Execution is still running.\nThe following options are available:\n\n- `Skip`: **Default**.\n  Nothing happens; the Workflow Execution is not started.\n- `BufferOne`: Starts the Workflow Execution as soon as the current one completes.\n  The buffer is limited to one.\n  If another Workflow Execution is supposed to start, but one is already in the buffer, only the one in the buffer eventually starts.\n- `BufferAll`: Allows an unlimited number of Workflows to buffer.\n  They are started sequentially.\n- `CancelOther`: Cancels the running Workflow Execution, and then starts the new one after the old one completes cancellation.\n- `TerminateOther`: Terminates the running Workflow Execution and starts the new one immediately.\n- `AllowAll` Starts any number of concurrent Workflow Executions.\n  With this policy (and only this policy), more than one Workflow Execution, started by the Schedule, can run simultaneously.\n\n#### Catchup Window\n\nThe Temporal Cluster might be down or unavailable at the time when a Schedule should take an Action.\nWhen it comes back up, the Catchup Window controls which missed Actions should be taken at that point.\nThe default is one minute, which means that the Schedule attempts to take any Actions that wouldn't be more than one minute late.\nAn outage that lasts longer than the Catchup Window could lead to missed Actions.\n(But you can always [Backfill](#backfill).)\n\n#### Pause-on-failure\n\nIf this policy is set, a Workflow Execution started by a Schedule that ends with a failure or timeout (but not Cancellation or Termination) causes the Schedule to automatically pause.\n\nNote that with the `AllowAll` Overlap Policy, this pause might not apply to the next Workflow Execution, because the next Workflow Execution might have started before the failed one finished.\nIt applies only to Workflow Executions that were scheduled to start after the failed one finished.\n\n### Last completion result\n\nA Workflow started by a Schedule can obtain the completion result from the most recent successful run.\n(How you do this depends on the SDK you're using.)\n\nFor overlap policies that don't allow overlap, “the most recent successful run” is straightforward to define.\nFor the `AllowAll` policy, it refers to the run that completed most recently, at the time that the run in question is started.\nConsider the following overlapping runs:\n\n```\ntime -------------------------------------------->\n A     |----------------------|\n B               |-------|\n C                          |---------------|\n D                                |--------------T\n```\n\nIf D asks for the last completion result at time T, it gets the result of A.\nNot B, even though B started more recently, because A completed later.\nAnd not C, even though C completed after A, because the result for D is captured when D is started, not when it's queried.\n\nFailures and timeouts do not affect the last completion result.\n\n### Last failure\n\nA Workflow started by a Schedule can obtain the details of the failure of the most recent run that ended at the time when the Workflow in question was started. Unlike last completion result, a _successful_ run _does_ reset the last failure.\n\n### Limitations\n\n:::info Experimental\n\nThe Scheduled Workflows feature is available in Temporal Server version 1.18.\n\nInternally, a Schedule is implemented as a Workflow.\nIf you're using Advanced Visibility (Elasticsearch), these Workflow Executions are hidden from normal views.\nIf you're using Standard Visibility, they are visible, though there's no need to interact with them directly.\n\n:::\n\nNative support for Schedules in language SDKs is coming soon.\nFor now, `tctl` and the web UI are the main interfaces to Schedules.\nFor advanced use, you can also use the gRPC API by getting a `WorkflowServiceClient` object from the SDK and calling methods such as `CreateSchedule`.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-a-search-attribute.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute","title":"What is a Search Attribute?","description":"A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.","label":"Search Attribute","tags":["term","explanation","filtered-lists","visibility"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Search Attribute is an indexed field used in a [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter) to filter a list of [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution) that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.\n\nIf a [Temporal Cluster](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster) does not have [Elasticsearch integrated](/clusters/how-to-integrate-elasticsearch-into-a-temporal-cluster), but a Workflow Execution is spawned and tagged with Search Attributes, no errors occur.\nHowever, you won't be able to use [Advanced Visibility](/concepts/what-is-advanced-visibility) List APIs and List Filters to find and list the Workflow Execution.\n\nWhen using [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new) or a [Temporal Cron Job](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job), Search Attributes are carried over to the new Workflow Run by default.\n\n#### Search Attributes maximums\n\nDefault total maximum number of Search Attribute **keys** per Temporal Cluster is 100.\n\n<!-- TODO - [How to configure maximum number of Search Attribute keys per Cluster](#) -->\n\nDefault single Search Attribute **value** size limit is 2 KB.\n\n<!-- TODO - [How to configure Search Attribute value size limit](#) -->\n\nTotal Search Attribute size: 40 KB\n\n<!-- TODO - [How to configure total Search Attribute size limite](#) -->\n\n<!-- temp keeping for reference\nThis is configurable with [`SearchAttributesNumberOfKeysLimit`, `SearchAttributesTotalSizeLimit` and `SearchAttributesSizeOfValueLimit`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L440-L442), if you know what you are doing.\n-->\n\n#### Default Search Attributes\n\nA Temporal Cluster that is integrated with Elasticsearch has a set of default Search Attributes already available.\nThese Search Attributes are created when the initial index is created.\n\n| NAME                  | TYPE     | DEFINITION                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| WorkflowType          | Keyword  | The type of Workflow.                                                                                                                                                        |\n| WorkflowId            | Keyword  | Identifies the Workflow Execution.                                                                                                                                           |\n| ExecutionStatus       | Keyword  | The current state of the Workflow Execution.                                                                                                                                 |\n| StartTime             | Datetime | The time at which the Workflow Execution started.                                                                                                                            |\n| CloseTime             | Datetime | The time at which the Workflow Execution completed.                                                                                                                          |\n| ExecutionTime         | Datetime | Same as StartTime for the most cases but different for cron Workflows and retried Workflows.

Each word in a **Text** is considered a searchable keyword.\n  For a UUID, that can be problematic because Elasticsearch indexes each portion of the UUID separately.\n  To have the whole string considered as a searchable keyword, use the **Keyword** type.\n  For example, if the key `ProductId` has the value of `2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`:\n  - As a **Keyword** it would be matched only by `ProductId = \"2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`.\n  - As a **Text** it would be matched by `ProductId = 2dd8`, which could cause unwanted matches.\n- The **Text** type cannot be used in the \"Order By\" clause.\n\n- [How to view Search Attributes using tctl](/tctl-v1/cluster#get-search-attributes)\n\n#### Search Attributes as Workflow Execution metadata\n\nTo actually have results

that wasn't drained for that time.\n\nThere are two types of Task Queues, Activity Task Queues and Workflow Task Queues.\n\n![Task Queue component](/diagrams/task-queue.svg)\n\nTask Queues are very lightweight components.\nTask Queues do not require explicit registration but instead are created on demand when a Workflow Execution or Activity spawns or when a Worker Process subscribes to it.\nWhen a Task Queue is created, both a Workflow Task Queue and an Activity Task Queue are created under the same name.\nThere is no limit to the number of Task Queues a Temporal Application can use or a Temporal Cluster can maintain.\n\nWorkers poll for Tasks in Task Queues via synchronous RPC.\nThis implementation offers several benefits:\n\n- A Worker Process polls for a message only when it has spare capacity, avoiding overloading itself.\n- In effect, Task Queues enable load balancing across many Worker Processes.\n- Task Queues enable what we call [Task Routing](/concepts/what-is-task-routing), which is the routing of specific Tasks to specific Worker Processes or even a specific process.\n- Task Queues support server-side throttling, which enables you to limit the Task dispatching rate to the pool of Worker Processes while still supporting Task dispatching at higher rates when spikes happen.\n- When all Worker Processes are down, messages simply persist in a Task Queue, waiting for the Worker Processes to recover.\n- Worker Processes do not need to advertise themselves through DNS or any other network discovery mechanism.\n- Worker Processes do not need to have any open ports, which is more secure.\n\nAll Workers listening to a given Task Queue must have identical registrations of Activities and/or Workflows.\nThe one exception is during a Server upgrade, where it is okay to have registration temporarily misaligned while the binary rolls out.\n\n#### Where to set Task Queues\n\nThere are four places where the name of the Task Queue can be set by the developer.\n\n1. A Task Queue must be set when spawning a Workflow Execution:\n\n- [How to start a Workflow Execution using an SDK](/application-development/foundations#set-task-queue)\n- [How to start a Workflow Execution using tctl](/tctl-v1/workflow#start)\n\n2. A Task Queue name must be set when creating a Worker Entity and when running a Worker Process:\n\n- [How to develop a Worker Program](/application-development/foundations#run-worker-processes)\n\nNote that all Worker Entities listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.\n\nIf a Worker Entity polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it will fail that Task.\nHowever, the failure of the Task will not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.\n\n3. A Task Queue name can be provided when spawning an Activity Execution:\n\nThis is optional.\nAn Activity Execution inherits the Task Queue name from its Workflow Execution if one is not provided.\n\n- [How to start an Activity Execution](/application-development/foundations#activity-execution)\n\n4.

Currently, we test with the following Prometheus and Grafana versions:\n\n- **Prometheus >= v2.0**\n- **Grafana >= v2.5**\n\n### Visibility\n\nTemporal has built-in [Visibility](/concepts/what-is-visibility) features.\nTo enhance this feature, Temporal supports an [integration with Elasticsearch](/clusters/how-to-integrate-elasticsearch-into-a-temporal-cluster).\n\n- Elasticsearch v8 is supported from Temporal version 1.18.0 onwards\n- Elasticsearch v7.10 is supported from Temporal version 1.7.0 onwards\n- Elasticsearch v6.8 is supported up to Temporal version 1.17.x\n- Elasticsearch v6.8 and v7.10 versions are explicitly supported with AWS Elasticsearch\n\n### mTLS encryption\n\nTemporal supports Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) as a method of encrypting network traffic between services within a Temporal Cluster, or between application processes and a Cluster.\n\nMutual TLS can be enabled in Temporal’s [TLS configuration](/references/configuration#tls).\nThis configuration can be passed through `WithConfig` or `WithConfigLoader`.\n\nThis configuration includes two sections that serve to separate intra-cluster and external traffic. That way, different certificates and settings can be used to encrypt each section of traffic:\n\n- `internode`: configuration for encrypting communication between nodes within the Cluster.\n- `frontend`: configuration for encrypting the Frontend's public endpoints\n\n### Temporal Client connections\n\nA client's network access can be limited by using certificates issued by a specific Certificate Authority (CA).\n\nTo restrict access to Temporal Cluster endpoints, use the `clientCAFiles` or `clientCAData` property and the `requireClientAuth` property.\nThese properties can be specified in both the `internode` and `frontend` sections of the [mTLS configuration](/references/configuration#tls).\n\n#### Server name specification\n\nSpecify the `serverName` in the `client` section of your mTLS configuration to prevent spoofing and [MITM attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).\n\nEntering a value for `serverName` enables established connections to authenticate the endpoint.\nThis ensures that the server certificate presented to any connected client has the specified server name in its CN property.\n\nThis measure can be used for `internode` and `frontend` endpoints.\n\nFor more information on mTLS configuration, refer to our [TLS configuration guide](/references/configuration#tls).\n\n### Auth\n\n**Authentication** is the process of verifying users who want to access your application are actually the users you want accessing it.\n**Authorization** is the verification of applications and data that a user on your Cluster or application has access to.\n\nTemporal has several authentication protocols that can be set to restrict access to your data.\nThese protocols address three areas: servers, client connections, and users.\n\nServer attacks can be prevented by specifying `serverName` in the `client` section of your mTLS configuration.\nThis can be done for both `frontend` and `internode` endpoints.\n\nClient connections can be restricted to certain endpoints by requiring certificates from a specific CA.\nModify the `clientCaFiles`, `clientCaData`, and `requireClientAuth` properties in the `internode` and `frontend` sections of the mTLS configuration.\n\nUser access can be restricted through extensibility points and plugins.\nWhen implemented, the `frontend` invokes the plugin before executing the requested operation.\n\nTemporal offers two plugin interfaces for API call authentication and authorization.\n\n- [`ClaimMapper`](/concepts/what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin)\n- [`Authorizer`](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin)\n\nThe logic of both plugins can be customized to fit a variety of use cases.\nWhen provided, the frontend invokes the implementation of the plugins before running the requested operation.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-a-temporal-cron-job.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job","title":"What is a Temporal Cron Job?","description":"A Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.","label":"Temporal Cron Job","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.\n\n- [How to set a Cron Schedule](/application-development/features#temporal-cron-jobs)\n\n![Temporal Cron Job timeline](/diagrams/temporal-cron-job.svg)\n\nA Temporal Cron Job is similar to a classic unix cron job.\nJust as a unix cron job accepts a command and a schedule on which to execute that command, a Cron Schedule can be provided with the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.\nIf a Cron Schedule is provided, the Temporal Server will spawn an execution for the associated Workflow Type per the schedule.\n\nEach Workflow Execution within the series is considered a Run.\n\n- Each Run receives the same input parameters as the initial Run.\n- Each Run inherits the same Workflow Options as the initial Run.\n\nThe Temporal Server spawns the first Workflow Execution in the chain of Runs immediately.\nHowever, it calculates and applies a backoff (`firstWorkflowTaskBackoff`) so that the first Workflow Task of the Workflow Execution does not get placed into a Task Queue until the scheduled time.\nAfter each Run Completes, Fails, or reaches the [Workflow Run Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-run-timeout), the same thing happens: the next run will be created immediately with a new `firstWorkflowTaskBackoff` that is calculated based on the current Server time and the defined Cron Schedule.\n\nThe Temporal Server spawns the next Run only after the current Run has Completed, Failed, or has reached the Workflow Run Timeout.\nThis means that, if a Retry Policy has also been provided, and a Run Fails or reaches the Workflow Run Timeout, the Run will first be retried per the Retry Policy until the Run Completes or the Retry Policy has been exhausted.\nIf the next Run, per the Cron Schedule, is due to spawn while the current Run is still Open (including retries), the Server automatically starts the new Run after the current Run completes successfully.\nThe start time for this new Run and the Cron definitions are used to calculate the `firstWorkflowTaskBackoff` that is applied to the new Run.\n\nA [Workflow Execution Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout) is used to limit how long a Workflow can be executing (have an Open status), including retries and any usage of Continue As New.\nThe Cron Schedule runs until the Workflow Execution Timeout is reached or you terminate the Workflow.\n\n![Temporal Cron Job Run Failure with a Retry Policy](/diagrams/temporal-cron-job-failure-with-retry.svg)\n\n### Cron Schedules\n\nCron Schedules are interpreted in UTC time by default.\n\nThe Cron Schedule is provided as a string and must follow one of two specifications:\n\n**Classic specification**\n\nThis is what the \"classic\" specification looks like:\n\n```\n┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)\n│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)\n│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)\n│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)\n│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)\n│ │ │ │ │\n│ │ │ │ │\n* * * * *\n```\n\nFor example, `15 8 * * *` causes a Workflow Execution to spawn daily at 8:15 AM UTC.\nUse the [crontab guru site](https://crontab.guru/) to test your cron expressions.\n\n### `robfig` predefined schedules and intervals\n\nYou can also pass any of the [predefined schedules](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3#hdr-Predefined_schedules) or [intervals](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3#hdr-Intervals) described in the [`robfig/cron` documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3).\n\n```\n| Schedules              | Description                                | Equivalent To |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |\n| @yearly (or @annually) | Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st        | 0 0 1 1 *     |\n| @monthly               | Run once a month, midnight, first of month | 0 0 1 * *     |\n| @weekly                | Run once a week, midnight between Sat/Sun  | 0 0 * * 0     |\n| @daily (or @midnight)  | Run once a day, midnight                   | 0 0 * * *     |\n| @hourly                | Run once an hour, beginning of hour        | 0 * * * *     |\n```\n\nFor example, \"@weekly\" causes a Workflow Execution to spawn once a week at midnight between Saturday and Sunday.\n\nIntervals just take a string that can be accepted by [time.ParseDuration](http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).\n\n```\n@every <duration>\n```\n\n### Time zones\n\n_This feature only applies in Temporal 1.15 and up_\n\nYou can change the time zone that a Cron Schedule is interpreted in by prefixing the specification with `CRON_TZ=America/New_York` (or your [desired time zone from tz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)). `CRON_TZ=America/New_York 15 8 * * *` therefore spawns a Workflow Execution every day at 8:15 AM New York time, subject to caveats listed below.\n\nConsider that using time zones in production introduces a surprising amount of complexity and failure modes!\n**If at all possible, we recommend specifying Cron Schedules in UTC (the default)**.\n\nIf you need to use time zones, here are a few edge cases to keep in mind:\n\n- **Beware Daylight Saving Time**: If a Temporal Cron Job is scheduled around the time when daylight saving time (DST) begins or ends (for example, `30 2 * * *`), **it might run zero, one, or two times in a day**! The Cron library that we use does not do any special handling of DST transitions. Avoid schedules that include times that fall within DST transition periods.\n  - For example, in the US, DST begins at 2 AM. When you \"fall back,\" the clock goes `1:59 … 1:00 … 1:01 … 1:59 … 2:00 … 2:01 AM` and any Cron jobs that fall in that 1 AM hour are fired again. The inverse happens when clocks \"spring forward\" for DST, and Cron jobs that fall in the 2 AM hour are skipped.\n  - In other time zones like Chile and Iran, DST \"spring forward\" is at midnight. 11:59 PM is followed by 1 AM, which means `00:00:00` never happens.\n- **Self Hosting note**: If you manage your own Temporal Cluster, you are responsible for ensuring that it has access to current `tzdata` files. The official Docker images are built with [tzdata](https://docs.w3cub.com/go/time/tzdata/index) installed (provided by Alpine Linux), but ultimately you should be aware of how tzdata is deployed and updated in your infrastructure.\n- **Updating Temporal**: If you use the official Docker images, note that an upgrade of the Temporal Cluster may include an update to the tzdata files, which may change the meaning of your Cron Schedule. You should be aware of upcoming changes to the definitions of the time zones you use, particularly around daylight saving time start/end dates.\n- **Absolute Time Fixed at Start**: The absolute start time of the next Run is computed and stored in the database when the previous Run completes, and is not recomputed. This means that if you have a Cron Schedule that runs very infrequently, and the definition of the time zone changes between one Run and the next, the Run might happen at the wrong time. For example, `CRON_TZ=America/Los_Angeles 0 12 11 11 *` means \"noon in Los Angeles on November 11\" (normally not in DST). If at some point the government makes any changes (for example, move the end of DST one week later, or stay on permanent DST year-round), the meaning of that specification changes. In that first year, the Run happens at the wrong time, because it was computed using the older definition.\n\n### How to stop a Temporal Cron Job\n\nA Temporal Cron Job does not stop spawning Runs until it has been Terminated or until the [Workflow Execution Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout) is reached.\n\nA Cancellation Request affects only the current Run.\n\nUse the Workflow Id in any requests to Cancel or Terminate.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-a-temporal-sdk.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-sdk.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-temporal-sdk","title":"What is a Temporal SDK?","description":"A Temporal SDK is a language-specific library that offers APIs to construct and use a Temporal Client to communicate with a Temporal Cluster, develop Workflow Definitions, and develop Worker Programs.","label":"Temporal SDK","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Temporal SDK is a language-specific library that offers APIs to do the following:\n\n1.

Code changes are made to a Workflow Definition that is in use by a running Workflow Execution.\n2. There is intrinsic non-deterministic logic (such as inline random branching).\n\n### Code changes can cause non-deterministic behavior\n\nThe Workflow Definition can change in very limited ways once there is a Workflow Execution depending on it.\nTo alleviate non-deterministic issues that arise from code changes, we recommend using [Workflow Versioning](#workflow-versioning).\n\nFor example, let's say we have a Workflow Definition that defines the following sequence:\n\n1. Start and wait on a Timer/sleep.\n2. Spawn and wait on an Activity Execution.\n3. Complete.\n\nWe start a Worker and spawn a Workflow Execution that uses that Workflow Definition.\nThe Worker would emit the [StartTimer](/references/commands/#starttimer) Command and the Workflow Execution would become suspended.\n\nBefore the Timer is up, we change the Workflow Definition to the following sequence:\n\n1. Spawn and wait on an Activity Execution.\n2. Start and wait on a Timer/sleep.\n3. Complete.\n\nWhen the Timer fires, the next Workflow Task will cause the Workflow Function to re-execute.\nThe first Command the Worker sees would be ScheduleActivityTask Command, which wouldn't match up to the expected [TimerStarted](/references/events/#timerstarted) Event.\n\nThe Workflow Execution would fail and return a non-deterministic error.\n\nThe following are examples of minor changes that would not result in non-determinism errors when re-executing a History which already contain the Events:\n\n- Changing the duration of a Timer (unless changing from a duration of 0).\n- Changing the arguments to:\n  - The Activity Options in a call to spawn an Activity Execution (local or nonlocal).\n  - The Child Workflow Options in a call to spawn a Child Workflow Execution.\n  - Call to Signal an External Workflow Execution.\n- Adding a Signal Handler for a Signal Type that has not been sent to this Workflow Execution.\n\n### Intrinsic non-deterministic logic\n\nIntrinsic non-determinism is when a Workflow Function Execution might emit a different sequence of Commands on re-execution, regardless of whether all the input parameters are the same.\n\nFor example, a Workflow Definition can not have inline logic that branches (emits a different Command sequence) based off a local time setting or a random number.\nIn the representative pseudocode below, the `local_clock()` function returns the local time, rather than Temporal-defined time:\n\n```text\nfn your_workflow() {\n  if local_clock().is_before(\"12pm\") {\n    await workflow.sleep(duration_until(\"12pm\"))\n  } else {\n    await your_afternoon_activity()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEach Temporal SDK offers APIs that enable Workflow Definitions to have logic that gets and uses time, random numbers, and data from unreliable resources.\nWhen those APIs are used, the results are stored as part of the Event History, which means that a re-executed Workflow Function will issue the same sequence of Commands, even if there is branching involved.\n\nIn other words, all operations that do not purely mutate the Workflow Execution's state should occur through a Temporal SDK API.\n\n### Workflow Versioning\n\nThe Workflow Versioning feature enables the creation of logical branching inside a Workflow Definition based on a developer specified version identifier.\nThis feature is useful for Workflow Definition logic needs to be updated, but there are running Workflow Executions that currently depends on it.\nIt is important to note that a practical way to handle different versions of Workflow Definitions, without using the versioning API, is to run the different versions on separate Task Queues.\n\n- [How to version Workflow Definitions in Go](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/go/versioning)\n- [How to version Workflow Definitions in Java](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/java/versioning)\n- [How to version Workflow Definitions in TypeScript](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/patching)\n\n### Handling unreliable Worker Processes\n\nYou do not handle Worker Process failure or restarts in a Workflow Definition.\n\nWorkflow Function Executions are completely oblivious to the Worker Process in terms of failures or downtime.\nThe Temporal Platform ensures that the state of a Workflow Execution is recovered and progress resumes if there is an outage of either Worker Processes or the Temporal Cluster itself.\nThe only reason a Workflow Execution might fail is due to the code throwing an error or exception, not because of underlying infrastructure outages.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout","title":"What is a Workflow Execution Timeout?","description":"A Workflow Execution Timeout is the maximum time that a Workflow Execution can be executing (have an Open status) including retries and any usage of Continue As New.","label":"Workflow Execution Timeout","tags":["term","explanation","timeouts"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Workflow Execution Timeout is the maximum time that a Workflow Execution can be executing (have an Open status) including retries and any usage of Continue As New.\n\n- [How to set a Workflow Execution Timeout](/app-dev-context/workflow-retries)\n\n![Workflow Execution Timeout period](/diagrams/workflow-execution-timeout.svg)\n\n**The default value is ∞ (infinite).**\nIf this timeout is reached, the Workflow Execution changes to a Timed Out status.\nThis timeout is different from the [Workflow Run Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-run-timeout).\nThis timeout is most commonly used for stopping the execution of a [Temporal Cron Job](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job) after a certain amount of time has passed.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-a-workflow-execution.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution","title":"What is a Workflow Execution?","description":"A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution.

During a Replay the Commands that are generated are checked against an existing Event History. Replays are necessary and often happen to give the effect that Workflow Executions are resumable, reliable, and durable.\n\nFor more information, see [Deterministic constraints](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints).\n\nIf a failure occurs, the Workflow Execution picks up where the last recorded event occurred in the Event History.\n\n- [How to use Replay APIs to test Workflow Definitions](/app-dev-context/replays)\n\n### Commands and awaitables\n\nA Workflow Execution does two things:\n\n1. Issue [Commands](/concepts/what-is-a-command).\n2. Wait on an Awaitables (often called Futures).\n\n![Command generation and waiting](/diagrams/workflow-execution-progession-simple.svg)\n\nCommands are issued and Awaitables are provided by the use of Workflow APIs in the [Workflow Definition](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition).\n\nCommands are generated whenever the Workflow Function is executed.\nThe Worker Process supervises the Command generation and makes sure that it maps to the current Event History.\n(For more information, see [Deterministic constraints](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints).)\nThe Worker Process batches the Commands and then suspends progress to send the Commands to the Cluster whenever the Workflow Function reaches a place where it can no longer progress without a result from an Awaitable.\n\nA Workflow Execution may only ever block progress on an Awaitable that is provided through a Temporal SDK API.\nAwaitables are provided when using APIs for the following:\n\n- Awaiting: Progress can block using explicit \"Await\" APIs.\n- Requesting cancellation of another Workflow Execution: Progress can block on confirmation that the other Workflow Execution is cancelled.\n- Sending a [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal): Progress can block on confirmation that the Signal sent.\n- Spawning a [Child Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-child-workflow-execution): Progress can block on confirmation that the Child Workflow Execution started, and on the result of the Child Workflow Execution.\n- Spawning an [Activity Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution): Progress can block on the result of the Activity Execution.\n- Starting a Timer: Progress can block until the Timer fires.\n\n### Status\n\nA Workflow Execution can be either Open or Closed.\n\n![Workflow Execution statuses](/diagrams/workflow-execution-statuses.svg)\n\n**Open**\n\n- Running: The only Open status for a Workflow Execution.\n  When the Workflow Execution is Running, it is either actively progressing or is waiting on something.\n\n**Closed**\n\nA Closed status means that the Workflow Execution cannot make further progress because of one of the following reasons:\n\n- Cancelled: The Workflow Execution successfully handled a cancellation request.\n- Completed: The Workflow Execution has completed successfully.\n- Continued-As-New: The Workflow Execution [Continued-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new).\n- Failed: The Workflow Execution returned an error and failed.\n- Terminated: The Workflow Execution was terminated.\n- Timed Out: The Workflow Execution reached a timeout limit.\n\n### Workflow Execution Chain\n\nA Workflow Execution Chain is a sequence of Workflow Executions that share the same Workflow Id.\nEach link in the Chain is often called a Workflow Run.\nEach Workflow Run in the sequence is connected by one of the following:\n\n- [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new)\n- [Retries](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy)\n- [Temporal Cron Job](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job)\n\nA Workflow Execution is uniquely identified by its [Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace), [Workflow Id](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id), and [Run Id](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id).\n\nThe [Workflow Execution Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout) applies to a Workflow Execution Chain.\nThe [Workflow Run Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-run-timeout) applies to a single Workflow Execution (Workflow Run).\n\n### Event loop\n\nA Workflow Execution is made up of a sequence of [Events](/concepts/what-is-an-event) called an [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history).\nEvents are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to either Commands or actions requested by a Temporal Client (such as a request to spawn a Workflow Execution).\n\n![Workflow Execution](/diagrams/workflow-execution-swim-lane-01.svg)\n\n### Time constraints\n\n**Is there a limit to how long Workflows can run?**\n\nNo, there is no time constraint on how long a Workflow Execution can be Running.\n\nHowever, Workflow Executions intended to run indefinitely should be written with some care.\nThe Temporal Cluster stores the complete Event History for the entire lifecycle of a Workflow Execution.\nThere is a hard limit of 50,000 Events in a Workflow Execution Event History, as well as a hard limit of 50 MB in terms of size.\nThe Temporal Cluster logs a warning at every 10,000 Events.\nWhen the Event History reaches 50,000 Events or the size limit of 50 MB, the Workflow Execution is forcefully terminated.\n\nTo prevent _runaway_ Workflow Executions, you can use the Workflow Execution Timeout, the Workflow Run Timeout, or both.\nA Workflow Execution Timeout can be used to limit the duration of Workflow Execution Chain, and a Workflow Run Timeout can be used to limit the duration an individual Workflow Execution (Run).\n\nYou can use the [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new) feature to close the current Workflow Execution and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation.\nThe Workflow Execution spawned from Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.\nFor example, it may be reasonable to use Continue-As-New once per day for a long-running Workflow Execution that is generating a large Event History.\n\n### Limits\n\nEach pending Activity generates a metadata entry in the Workflow's mutable state.\nToo many entries create a large mutable state, which causes unstable persistence.\n\nTo protect the system, Temporal enforces a maximum of 50,000 pending Activities, Child Workflows, external Workflows, and Signals.\nThese limits are set with the following [dynamic configuration keys](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/service/history/configs/config.go):\n\n- `NumPendingChildExecutionsLimit`\n- `NumPendingActivitiesLimit`\n- `NumPendingSignals`\n- `NumPendingCancelRequestsLimit`\n\nBy default, Temporal fails Workflow Task Executions that would cause the Workflow to surpass 50,000 pending Activities, Child Workflows, external Workflows, or Signals.\nSimilar constraints are enforced for `SignalExternalWorkflowExecution`, `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution`, and `StartChildWorkflowExecution` Commands.\n\n:::note\n\nCloud users are limited to 2,000 each of pending Activities, Child Workflows, external Workflows, and Signals.\n\n:::\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-a-workflow-id-reuse-policy.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id-reuse-policy.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id-reuse-policy","title":"What

is an Activity Definition?","description":"An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.","label":"Activity Definition","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAn Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an [Activity Task Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution).\n\n- [How to develop an Activity Definition](/application-development/foundations#develop-activities)\n\nThe term 'Activity Definition' is used to refer to the full set of primitives in any given language SDK that provides an access point to an Activity Function Definition——the method or function that is invoked for an [Activity Task Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution).\nTherefore, the terms Activity Function and Activity Method refer to the source of an instance of an execution.\n\nActivity Definitions are named and referenced in code by their [Activity Type](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-type).\n\n![Activity Definition](/diagrams/activity-definition.svg)\n\n#### Idempotency\n\nTemporal recommends that Activities be idempotent.\n\nAn Activity is idempotent if multiple [Activity Task Executions](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution) do not change the state of the system beyond the first Activity Task Execution.\n\nWe recommend using idempotency keys for critical side effects.\n\nThe lack of idempotency might affect the correctness of your application but does not affect the Temporal Platform.\nIn other words, lack of idempotency does not lead to a platform error.\n\nIn some cases, whether something is idempotent does not affect the correctness of an application.\nFor example, if you have a monotonically incrementing counter, you might not care that retries increment the counter because you don’t care about the actual value, only that the current value is greater than a previous value.\n\n#### Constraints\n\nActivity Definitions are executed as normal functions.\n\nIn the event of failure, the function begins at its initial state when retried (except when Activity Heartbeats are established).\n\nTherefore, an Activity Definition has no restrictions on the code it contains.\n\n#### Parameters\n\nAn Activity Definition can support as many parameters as needed.\n\nAll values passed through these parameters are recorded in the [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history) of the Workflow Execution.\nReturn values are also captured in the Event History for the calling Workflow Execution.\n\nActivity Definitions must contain the following parameters:\n\n- Context: an optional parameter that provides Activity context within multiple APIs.\n- Heartbeat: a notification from the Worker to the Temporal Cluster that the Activity Execution is progressing. Cancelations are allowed only if the Activity Definition permits Heartbeating.\n- Timeouts: intervals that control the execution and retrying of Activity Task Executions.\n\nOther parameters, such as [Retry Policies](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy) and return values, can be seen in the implementation guides, listed in the next section.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-an-activity-execution.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution.md","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution","title":"What is an Activity Execution?","description":"An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.","label":"Activity Execution","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAn Activity Execution is the full chain of [Activity Task Executions](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution).\n\n- [How to spawn an Activity Execution](/application-development/foundations#activity-execution)\n\n![Activity Execution](/diagrams/activity-execution.svg)\n\nBy default, an Activity Execution has no time limit.\nActivity Execution [timeouts](/application-development/features#activity-timeouts) and [retry policies](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy) can be customized.\n\nIf an Activity Execution fails (because it exhausted all retries, threw a [non-retryable error](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy#non-retryable-errors), or was canceled), the error is returned to the [Workflow](/workflows), which decides how to handle it.\n\n### Cancellation\n\nActivity Cancellation:\n\n- lets the Activity know it doesn't need to keep doing work, and\n- gives the Activity time to clean up any resources it has created.\n\nActivities can only receive Cancellation if they emit Heartbeats or in Core-based SDKs (TypeScript/Python) are Local Activities (which don't heartbeat but receive Cancellation anyway).\n\nAn Activity may receive Cancellation if:\n\n- The Activity was requested to be Cancelled. This can often cascade from Workflow Cancellation, but not always—SDKs have ways to stop Cancellation from cascading. <!-- TODO link to workflow cancellation -->\n- The Activity was considered failed by the Server because any of the Activity timeouts have triggered (for example, the Server didn't receive a heartbeat within the Activity's Heartbeat timeout). The [Cancelled Failure](/kb/failures#cancelled-failure) that the Activity receives will have `message: 'TIMED_OUT'`.\n- The Workflow Run reached a [Closed state](/workflows#status), in which case the Cancelled Failure will have `message: 'NOT_FOUND'`.\n- In some SDKs:\n  - The Worker is shutting down.\n  - An Activity sends a Heartbeat but the Heartbeat details can't be converted by the Worker's configured [Data Converter](/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter). This fails the Activity Task Execution with an Application Failure.\n\nThere are different ways to receive Cancellation depending on the SDK. <!-- TODO link to dev guide -->\nAn Activity may accept or ignore Cancellation:\n\n- To allow Cancellation to happen, let the Cancellation Failure propagate.\n- To ignore Cancellation, catch it and continue executing.\n\nSome SDKs have ways to shield tasks from being stopped while still letting the Cancellation propagate.\n\nThe Workflow can also decide if it wants to wait for the Activity Cancellation to be accepted or to proceed without waiting.\n\nCancellation can only be requested a single time.\nIf you try to cancel your Activity Execution more than once, it will not receive more than one Cancellation request.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-an-activity-heartbeat.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-an-activity-heartbeat.md","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-heartbeat","title":"What is an Activity Heartbeat?","description":"An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster.

Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.\nHeartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.\n\n#### Throttling\n\nHeartbeats may not always be sent to the Cluster—they may be throttled by the Worker.\nThe throttle interval is the smaller of the following:\n\n- If `heartbeatTimeout` is provided, `heartbeatTimeout * 0.8`; otherwise, `defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval`\n- `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval`\n\n`defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval` is 30 seconds by default, and `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval` is 60 seconds by default.\nEach can be set in Worker options.\n\nThrottling is implemented as follows:\n\n- After sending a Heartbeat, the Worker sets a timer for the throttle interval.\n- The Worker stops sending Heartbeats, but continues receiving Heartbeats from the Activity and remembers the most recent one.\n- When the timer fires, the Worker:\n  - Sends the most recent Heartbeat.\n  - Sets the timer again.\n\n#### Which Activities should Heartbeat?\n\nHeartbeating is best thought about not in terms of time, but in terms of \"How do you know you are making progress?\"\nFor short-term operations, progress updates are not a requirement.\nHowever, checking the progress and status of Activity Executions that run over long periods is almost always useful.\n\nConsider the following when setting Activity Hearbeats:\n\n- Your underlying task must be able to report definite progress.\n  Note that your Workflow cannot read this progress information while the Activity is still executing (or it would have to store it in Event History).\n  You can report progress to external sources if you need it exposed to the user.\n\n- Your Activity Execution is long-running, and you need to verify whether the Worker that is processing your Activity is still alive and has not run out of memory or silently crashed.\n\nFor example, the following scenarios are suitable for Heartbeating:\n\n- Reading a large file from Amazon S3.\n- Running a ML training job on some local GPUs.\n\nAnd the following scenarios are not suitable for Heartbeating:\n\n- Making a quick API call.\n- Reading a small file from disk.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-an-activity-id.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-an-activity-id.md","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-id","title":"What

Event History.\n\nAll values passed to a Workflow Execution through parameters or returned through a result value are recorded into the Event History.\nA Temporal Cluster stores the full Event History of a Workflow Execution for the duration of a Namespace's retention period.\nA Workflow Execution that periodically executes many Activities has the potential of hitting the size limit.\n\nA very large Event History can adversely affect the performance of a Workflow Execution.\nFor example, in the case of a Workflow Worker failure, the full Event History must be pulled from the Temporal Cluster and given to another Worker via a Workflow Task.\nIf the Event history is very large, it may take some time to load it.\n\nThe Continue-As-New feature enables developers to complete the current Workflow Execution and start a new one atomically.\n\nThe new Workflow Execution has the same Workflow Id, but a different Run Id, and has its own Event History.\n\nIn the case of [Temporal Cron Jobs](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job), Continue-As-New is actually used internally for the same effect.\n\n- [How to

Executions from active Clusters to other passive Clusters, for backup and state reconstruction.\nWhen necessary, for higher availability, Cluster operators can failover to any of the backup Clusters.\n\nTemporal's Multi-Cluster Replication feature is considered **experimental** and not subject to normal [versioning and support policy](/clusters).\n\nTemporal automatically forwards Start, Signal, and Query requests to the active Cluster.\nThis feature must be enabled through a Dynamic Config flag per [Global Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-global-namespace).\n\nWhen the feature is enabled, Tasks are sent to the Parent Task Queue partition that matches that Namespace, if it exists.\n\nAll Visibility APIs can be used against active and standby Clusters.\nThis enables [Temporal Web](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-web) to work seamlessly for Global Namespaces.\nApplications making API calls directly to the Temporal Visibility API continue to work even if a Global Namespace is in standby mode.\nHowever, they might see a lag due to replication delay when querying the Workflow Execution state from a standby Cluster.\n\n#### Namespace Versions\n\nA _version_ is a concept in Multi-Cluster Replication that describes the chronological order of events per Namespace.\n\nWith Multi-Cluster Replication, all Namespace change events and Workflow Execution History events are replicated asynchronously for high throughput.\nThis means that data across clusters is **not** strongly consistent.\nTo guarantee that Namespace data and Workflow Execution data will achieve eventual consistency (especially when there is a data conflict during a failover), a **version** is introduced and attached to Namespaces.\nAll Workflow Execution History entries generated in a Namespace will also come with the version attached to that Namespace.\n\nAll participating Clusters are pre-configured with a unique initial version and a shared version increment:\n\n- `initial version < shared version increment`\n\nWhen performing failover for a Namespace from one Cluster to another Cluster, the version attached to the Namespace will be changed by the following rule:\n\n- for all versions which follow `version % (shared version increment) == (active cluster's initial version)`, find the smallest version which has `version >= old version in namespace`\n\nWhen there is a data conflict, a comparison will be made and Workflow Execution History entries with the highest version will be considered the source of truth.\n\nWhen a cluster is trying to mutate a Workflow Execution History, the version will be checked.\nA cluster can mutate a Workflow Execution History only if the following is true:\n\n- The version in the Namespace belongs to this cluster, i.e.\n  `(version in namespace) % (shared version increment) == (this cluster's initial version)`\n- The version of this Workflow Execution History's last entry (event) is equal or less than the version in the Namespace, i.e.\n  `(last event's version) <= (version in namespace)`\n\n<details>\n<summary>Namespace version change example\n</summary>\n\nAssuming the following scenario:\n\n- Cluster A comes with initial version: 1\n- Cluster B comes with initial version: 2\n- Shared version increment: 10\n\nT = 0: Namespace α is registered, with active Cluster set to Cluster A\n\n```\nnamespace α's version is 1\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 1\n```\n\nT = 1: namespace β is registered, with active Cluster set to Cluster B\n\n```\nnamespace β's version is 2\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 2\n```\n\nT = 2: Namespace α is updated to with active Cluster set to Cluster B\n\n```\nnamespace α's version is 2\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 2\n```\n\nT = 3: Namespace β is updated to with active Cluster set to Cluster A\n\n```\nnamespace β's version is 11\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 11\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### Version history\n\nVersion history is a concept which provides a high level summary of version information in regards to Workflow Execution History.\n\nWhenever there is a new Workflow Execution History entry generated, the version from Namespace will be attached.\nThe Workflow Executions's mutable state will keep track of all history entries (events) and the corresponding version.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Version history example (without data conflict)\n</summary>\n\n-

in Cluster C, same as above\n\n</details>\n\n#### Conflict resolution\n\nWhen a Workflow Execution History diverges, proper conflict resolution is applied.\n\nIn Multi-cluster Replication, Workflow Execution History Events are modeled as a tree, as shown in the second example in [Version History](#version-history).\n\nWorkflow Execution Histories that diverge will have more than one history branch.\nAmong all history branches, the history branch with the highest version is considered the `current branch` and the Workflow Execution's mutable state is a summary of the current branch.\nWhenever there is a switch between Workflow Execution History branches, a complete rebuild of the Workflow Execution's mutable state will occur.\n\nTemporal Multi-Cluster Replication relies on asynchronous replication of Events across Clusters, so in the case of a failover it is possible to have an Activity Task dispatched again to the newly active Cluster due to a replication task lag.\nThis also means that whenever a Workflow Execution is updated after a failover by the new Cluster, any previous replication tasks for that Execution cannot be applied.\nThis results in loss of some progress made by the Workflow Execution in the previous active Cluster.\nDuring such conflict resolution, Temporal re-injects any external Events like Signals in the new Event History before discarding replication tasks.\nEven though some progress could roll back during failovers, Temporal provides the guarantee that Workflow Executions won’t get stuck and will continue to make forward progress.\n\nActivity Execution completions are not forwarded across Clusters.\nAny outstanding Activities will eventually time out based on the configuration.\nYour application should have retry logic in place so that the Activity gets retried and dispatched again to a Worker after the failover to the new Cluster.\nHandling this is similar to handling an Activity Task timeout caused by a Worker restarting.\n\n#### Zombie Workflows\n\nThere is an existing contract that for any Namespace and Workflow Id combination, there can be at most one run (Namespace + Workflow Id + Run Id) open / executing.\n\nMulti-cluster Replication aims to keep the Workflow Execution History as up-to-date as possible among all participating Clusters.\n\nDue to the nature of Multi-cluster Replication (for example, Workflow Execution History events are replicated asynchronously) different Runs (same Namespace and Workflow Id) can arrive at the target Cluster at different times, sometimes out of order, as shown below:\n\n```\n| ------------- |          | ------------- |          | ------------- |\n| Cluster A |  | Network Layer |  | Cluster B |\n| --------- || ------------- |          | ------------- |\n        |                          |                          |\n        | Run 1 Replication Events |                          |\n        | -----------------------> |

|\n| Cluster A |  | Network Layer |  | Cluster B |\n| --------- || ------------- |          | ------------- |\n```\n\nBecause Run 2 appears in Cluster B first, Run 1 cannot be replicated as \"runnable\" due to the rule `at most one Run open` (see above), thus the \"zombie\" Workflow Execution state is introduced.\nA \"zombie\" state is one in which a Workflow Execution which cannot be actively mutated by a Cluster (assuming the corresponding Namespace is active in this Cluster). A zombie Workflow Execution can only be changed by a replication Task.\n\nRun 1 will be replicated similar to Run 2, except when Run 1's execution will become a \"zombie\" before Run 1 reaches completion.\n\n#### Workflow Task processing\n\nIn the context of Multi-cluster Replication, a Workflow Execution's mutable state is an entity which tracks all pending tasks.\nPrior to the introduction of Multi-cluster Replication, Workflow Execution History entries (events) are from a single branch, and the Temporal Server will only append new entries (events) to the Workflow Execution History.\n\nAfter the introduction of Multi-cluster Replication, it is possible that a Workflow Execution can have multiple Workflow Execution History branches.\nTasks generated according to one history branch may become invalidated by switching history branches during conflict resolution.\n\nExample:\n\nT = 0: task A is generated according to Event Id: 4, version: 2\n\n```\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| Events   |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| Event ID | Event Version |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| 1        | 1             |\n| 2        | 1             |\n| 3        | 2

Routing","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTask Routing is simply when a Task Queue is paired with one or more Workers, primarily for Activity Task Executions.\n\nThis could also mean employing multiple Task Queues, each one paired with a Worker Process.\n\nTask Routing has many applicable use cases.\n\n### Flow control\n\nA Worker that consumes from a Task Queue asks for an Activity Task only when it has available capacity, so it is never overloaded by request spikes.\nIf Activity Tasks get created faster than Workers can process them, they are backlogged in the Task Queue.\n\n### Throttling\n\nThe rate at which each Activity Worker polls for and processes Activity Tasks is configurable per Worker.\nWorkers do not exceed this rate even if it has spare capacity.\nThere is also support for global Task Queue rate limiting.\nThis limit works across all Workers for the given Task Queue.\nIt is frequently used to limit load on a downstream service that an Activity calls into.\n\n### Specific environments\n\nIn some cases, you might need to execute Activities in a dedicated environment.\nTo send Activity Tasks to this environment, use a dedicated Task Queue.\n\n#### Route Activity Tasks to a specific host\n\nIn some use cases, such as file processing or machine learning model training, an Activity Task must be routed to a specific Worker Process or Worker Entity.\n\nFor example, suppose that you have a Workflow with the following three separate Activities:\n\n- Download a file.\n- Process the file in some way.\n- Upload a file to another location.\n\nThe first Activity, to download the file, could occur on any Worker on any host.\nHowever, the second and third Activities must be executed by a Worker on the same host where the first Activity downloaded the file.\n\nIn a real-life scenario, you might have many Worker Processes scaled over many hosts.\nYou would need to develop your Temporal Application to route Tasks to specific Worker Processes when needed.\n\nCode samples:\n\n- [Go file processing example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/master/fileprocessing)\n- [Java file processing example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/fileprocessing)\n- [PHP file processing example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/tree/master/app/src/FileProcessing)\n\n#### Sessions\n\nSome SDKs provide a Session API that provides a straightforward way to ensure that Activity Tasks are executed with the same Worker without requiring you to manually specify Task Queue names.\nIt also includes features like **concurrent session limitations** and **worker failure detection**.\n\n- [How to create Worker Sessions in Go](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/go/how-to-create-a-worker-session-in-go)\n\n#### Route Activity Tasks to a specific process\n\nSome Activities load large datasets and cache them in the process.\nThe Activities that rely on those datasets should be routed to the same process.\n\nIn this case, a unique Task Queue would exist for each Worker Process involved.\n\n#### Workers with different capabilities\n\nSome Workers might exist on GPU boxes versus non-GPU boxes.\nIn this case, each type of box would have its own Task Queue and a Workflow can pick one to send Activity Tasks.\n\n### Multiple priorities\n\nIf your use case involves more than one priority, you can create one Task Queue per priority, with a Worker pool per priority.\n\n### Versioning\n\nTask Routing is the simplest way to version your code.\n\nIf you have a new backward-incompatible Activity Definition, start by using a different Task Queue.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"what-is-tctl-next.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-tctl-next.md","id":"concepts/what-is-tctl-next","title":"What

Workflows.\n\nFor example, a real-life production deployment can have 5 Frontend, 15 History, 17 Matching, and 3 Worker Services per cluster.\n\nThe Temporal Server services can run independently or be grouped together into shared processes on one or more physical or virtual machines.\nFor live (production) environments, we recommend that each service runs independently, because each one has different scaling requirements and troubleshooting becomes easier.\nThe History, Matching, and Worker Services can scale horizontally within a Cluster.\nThe Frontend Service scales differently than the others because it has no sharding or partitioning; it is just stateless.\n\nEach service is aware of the others, including scaled instances, through a membership protocol via [Ringpop](https://github.com/temporalio/ringpop-go).\n\n#### Versions and support\n\nAll Temporal Server releases abide by the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/).\n\nFairly precise upgrade paths and support have been established starting from Temporal `v1.7.0`.\n\nWe provide maintenance support for previously published minor and major versions by continuing to release critical bug fixes related to security, the prevention of data loss, and reliability, whenever they are found.\n\nWe aim to publish incremental upgrade guides for each minor and major version, which include specifics about dependency upgrades that we have tested for (such as Cassandra 3.0 -> 3.11).\n\nWe offer maintenance support of the last three **minor** versions after a release and do not plan to \"backport\" patches beyond that.\n\nWe offer maintenance support of **major** versions for at least 12 months after a GA release, and we provide at least 6 months' notice before EOL/deprecating support.\n\n#### Dependencies\n\nTemporal offers official support for, and is tested against, dependencies with the exact versions described in the `go.mod` file of the corresponding release tag.\n(For example, [v1.5.1](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/v1.5.1) dependencies are documented in [the go.mod for

Temporal.","tags":["explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nimport Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\nimport TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n\nOne of the aspects of the Temporal System is that it abstracts the complexity of a distributed system.\nDistributed systems exist to scale computation across multiple machines as the potential load of a system changes.\nIn theory, a distributed system facilitates a reliable and highly performant application.\n\nHowever, any failure that leaves the downstream part of the application waiting for a response can make things very complicated, especially at a large scale.\n\n![Distributed application failures](/diagrams/basic-distributed-system.svg)\n\nHow will a downstream part of the application know if there was a failure before or a failure after changes to the state if there is no response?\nHow will the application track and reconcile an inconsistent state?\n\nIn traditional systems, a large investment is often made to maintain the health of each individual component, visualize the health of the overall system, define timeout constraints for computations, orchestrate retries for computations that fail, and maintain a consistent state.\n\nThese systems are often a mixture of stateless services, databases, cron jobs, and queues.\nAnd as these systems scale, responding to multiple asynchronous events, communicating with unreliable external resources, or tracking the state of something very complex becomes more and more challenging.\n\nTemporal restructures the use of services, databases, cron jobs, queues, host processes, and SDKs, into the Temporal Platform, and addresses failures head on.\n\nIn a traditional system, the service exists to spawn function executions.\nThe Temporal Platform exists to facilitate [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution).\n\n![Temporal vs Traditional system](/diagrams/temporal-vs-traditional.svg)\n\nAlthough the two systems seem similar at first glance, they differ in several significant ways.\n\n**Failure**\n\nWith a traditional system, a service function execution is both volatile and short-lived.\n\n- If a function execution fails, it's not resumable because all execution state is lost. The longer a function execution awaits, the higher the chance of failure.\n- A traditional function execution typically has a limited lifespan, often measured in minutes.\n\nWith Temporal, a Workflow Execution is resumable.\n\n- A Workflow Execution is fully resumable after a failure.\n- Temporal imposes no deadlines on Workflow Executions.\n\n**State**\n\nWith a traditional system, stoppage or failure means that all execution state is lost.\nYour application (or a supporting component) must monitor the service's response to initiate a retry of the service execution.\nA retry starts from its _initial_ state.\n\nWith Temporal, computation resumes from its _latest_ state. All progress is retained.\n\n**Communication**\n\nWith a traditional system, you can't communicate with a function execution.\n\nWith Temporal, [Signals](/concepts/what-is-a-signal) and [Queries](/concepts/what-is-a-query) enable data to be sent to or extracted from a Workflow Execution.\n\n**Scope**\n\nWith a traditional system, a service function execution can at best represent a business process.\nTypically, it represents only a part of a business process.\n\nA Temporal Workflow Execution can represent a business process or an entire business object.\n\n### Example subscription use case\n\nLet's look at a subscription-based use case to compare the difference between a Temporal Application and other traditional approaches.\n\nThe basic business steps are as follows:\n\n1. A customer signs up for a service that has a trial period.\n2. After the trial period, if the customer has not canceled, they should be charged once a month.\n3. The customer has to be notified via email about the charges and should be able to cancel the subscription at any time.\n\nThis business logic is not very complicated and can be expressed in a few dozen lines of code.\nAny practical implementation also has to ensure that the business process is fault-tolerant and scalable.\n\n**Database-centric design approach**\n\nThe first approach might be to center everything around a database where an application process would periodically scan the database tables for customers in specific states, execute necessary actions, and update the database to reflect changes.\n\nHowever, there are various drawbacks.\n\n- The most obvious one is that the application state machine of the customer's state quickly becomes extremely complicated.\n  For example, if a credit card charge attempt fails or sending an email fails due to a downstream system's unavailability, the state is now in limbo.\n- Failed calls likely need to be retried for a long time, and these calls need to be throttled to not overload external resources.\n- There needs to be logic to handle corrupted customer records to avoid blocking the whole process.\n- Additionally, databases have performance and scalability limitations (eventually requiring sharding) and are not efficient for scenarios that require constant polling.\n\n**Queue system design approach**\n\nThe next commonly employed approach is to use a timer service and queues.\nUpdates are pushed to a queue while a service consumes them one at a time, updating a database, and possibly pushing more messages into other downstream queues.\nA timer service can be used to schedule queue polling or database actions.\n\nWhile this approach has shown to scale a bit better, the programming model can become very complex and error-prone, as there are usually no transactional updates between a queuing system, a timer service, and a database.\n\n**Temporal design approach**\n\nThe Temporal Platform approach aims to encapsulate and implement the entire business logic in a simple function or object method.\nThanks to the Temporal Platform, the function/method is durably stateful, and the implementer doesn't need to employ any additional systems to ensure consistency and fault tolerance.\n\nHere are example Workflow Definitions that implement the subscription management use case in Java, Go, Typescript and PHP:\n\n<Tabs\ndefaultValue=\"java\"\nvalues={[\n{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},\n{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},\n{label: 'Typescript', value: 'ts'},\n{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},\n]\n}>\n\n<TabItem value=\"go\">\n\n<!--SNIPSTART subscription-go-workflow-definition-->\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value=\"java\">\n\n<!--SNIPSTART subscription-java-workflow-definition-implementation-->\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value=\"ts\">\n\n<!--SNIPSTART subscription-ts-workflow-definition-->\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value=\"php\">\n\n<!--SNIPSTART subscription-php-workflow-definition-implementation-->\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\nAgain, it is important to note that this is working application code that directly implements the business logic.\nIf any of the operations take a long time, the code is not going to change.\n\nIt is completely okay to be blocked on `chargeCustomerForBillingPeriod` for a day or more if the downstream processing service is down or not responding.\nIn the same way, it is a completely normal operation to sleep for 30 days directly inside the Workflow code.\nThis is possible because infrastructure failures won't affect the Workflow state—including threads, blocking calls, and any variables.\n\nThe Temporal Platform has practically no scalability limits on the number of open Workflow Executions, so this code can be used over and over even if your application has hundreds of millions of customers.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"api-reference-go.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/go/api-reference-go.md","id":"go/api-reference-go","title":"API

*YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context) error {\n // ...\n}\n\nfunc(a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinitionTwo(ctx context.Context) error {\n // ...\n}\n```\n\nAn _Activity struct_ can have more than one method, with each method acting as a separate Activity Type.\nActivities written as struct methods can use shared struct variables, such as:\n\n- an application level DB pool\n- client connection to another service\n- reusable utilities\n- any other expensive resources that you only want to initialize once per process\n\nBecause this is such a common need, the rest of this guide shows Activities written as `struct` methods.\n\n### Parameters\n\nThe first parameter of an Activity Definition is `context.Context`.\nThis parameter is optional for an Activity Definition, though it is recommended, especially if the Activity is expected to use other Go SDK APIs.\n\nAn Activity Definition can support as many other custom parameters as needed.\nHowever, all parameters must be serializable (parameters can’t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers), and it is recommended to pass a single struct that can be updated later.\n\n```go\ntype YourActivityParam struct {\n ActivityParamFieldOne string\n ActivityParamFieldTwo int\n}\n\ntype YourActivityStruct struct {\n // ...\n}\n\nfunc (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) error {\n // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Return values\n\nA Go-based Activity Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination (same as a Workflow Definition).\nYou may wish to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values, just keep in mind they must all be serializable.\n\n```go\ntype YourActivityResult struct{\n  ActivityResultFieldOne string\n  ActivityResultFieldTwo int\n}\n\nfunc (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (YourActivityResult, error) {\n  // ...\n  result := YourActivityResult {\n    ActivityResultFieldOne: a.ActivityFieldOne,\n    ActivityResultFieldTwo: a.ActivityFieldTwo,\n  }\n  return result, nil\n}\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"develop-workflows.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/go/develop-workflows.md","id":"go/develop-workflows","title":"Develop a Workflow in Go","description":"In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, a Workflow Definition is an exportable function.","label":"Workflow Development","tags":["developer-guide","go"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nIn the Temporal Go SDK programming model, a [Workflow Definition](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition) is an exportable function.\n\n```go\nfunc YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context) error {\n  // ...\n  return nil\n}\n```\n\nIn Go, by default, the Workflow Type name is the same as the function name.\n\n### Parameters\n\nThe first parameter of a Go-based Workflow Definition must be of the [`workflow.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Context) type, as it is used by the Temporal Go SDK to pass around Workflow Execution context, and virtually all the Go SDK APIs that are callable from the Workflow require it.\nIt is acquired from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow) package.\n\n```go\nimport (\n   \"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow\"\n)\n\nfunc YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param string) error {\n // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `workflow.Context` entity operates similarly to the standard `context.Context` entity provided by Go.\nThe only difference between `workflow.Context` and `context.Context` is that the `Done()` function, provided by `workflow.Context`, returns `workflow.Channel` instead of the standard Go `chan`.\n\nThe second parameter, `string`, is a custom parameter that is passed to the Workflow when it is invoked.\nA Workflow Definition may support multiple custom parameters, or none.\nThese parameters can be regular type variables or safe pointers.\nHowever, the best practice is to pass a single parameter that is of a `struct` type, so there can be some backward compatibility if new parameters are added.\n\n```go\ntype YourWorkflowParam struct {\n WorkflowParamFieldOne string\n WorkflowParamFieldTwo int\n}\n\nfunc YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {\n // ...\n}\n```\n\nAll Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable, regardless of whether pointers or regular type values are used.\nParameters can’t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers.\n\n### Return values\n\nA Go-based Workflow Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination.\nAgain, the best practice here is to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values.\n\n```go\ntype YourWorkflowResponse struct{\n WorkflowResultFieldOne string\n WorkflowResultFieldTwo int\n}\n\nfunc YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {\n // ...\n if err != nil {\n   return \"\", err\n }\n responseVar := YourWorkflowResponse {\n   FieldOne: \"super\",\n   FieldTwo: 1,\n }\n return responseVar, nil\n}\n```\n\nA Workflow Definition written in Go can return both a custom value and an error.\nHowever, it's not possible to receive both a custom value and an error in the calling process, as is normal in Go.\nThe caller will receive either one or the other.\nReturning a non-nil `error` from a Workflow indicates that an error was encountered during its execution and the Workflow Execution should be terminated, and any custom return values will be ignored by the system.\n\n### Logic requirements\n\nIn Go, Workflow Definition code cannot directly do the following:\n\n- Iterate over maps using `range`, because with `range` the order of the map's iteration is randomized.\n  Instead you can collect the keys of the map, sort them, and then iterate over the sorted keys to access the map.\n  This technique provides deterministic results.\n  You can also use a Side Effect or an Activity to process the map instead.\n- Call an external API, conduct a file I/O operation, talk to another service, etc. (Use an Activity for these.)\n\nThe Temporal Go SDK has APIs to handle equivalent Go constructs:\n\n- `workflow.Now()` This is a replacement for `time.Now()`.\n- `workflow.Sleep()` This is a replacement for `time.Sleep()`.\n- `workflow.GetLogger()` This ensures that the provided logger does not duplicate logs during a replay.\n- `workflow.Go()` This is a replacement for the `go` statement.\n- `workflow.Channel` This is a replacement for the native `chan` type.\n  Temporal provides support for both buffered and unbuffered channels.\n- `workflow.Selector` This is a replacement for the `select` statement.\n  Learn more on the [Go SDK Selectors](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/go/selectors) page.\n- `workflow.Context` This is a replacement for `context.Context`.\n  See [Tracing](/app-dev-context/tracing) for more information about context propagation.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"error-handling.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/go/error-handling.md","id":"go/error-handling","title":"Error Handling

{\n   // ...\n }\n // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe instance of `WorkflowRun` has the following three methods:\n\n- `GetWorkflowID()`: Returns the Workflow Id of the invoked Workflow Execution.\n- `GetRunID()`: Always returns the Run Id of the initial Run (See [Continue As New](#)) in the series of Runs that make up the full Workflow Execution.\n- `Get`: Takes a pointer as a parameter and populates the

calls to spawn Activity Executions.","label":"Worker Session","tags":["go","developer-guide"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nFirst, [enable Sessions on the Worker via the Worker Options](/go/how-to-set-workeroptions-in-go#enablesessionworker).\n\nNext, use the [`CreateSession`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#CreateSession) API to create a Context object that can be passed to calls to spawn Activity Executions.\n\nPass an instance of `workflow.Context` and [`SessionOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#SessionOptions) to the `CreateSession` API call and get a Session Context which contains metadata information of the Session.\n\nUse the Session Context to spawn all Activity Executions that should belong to the Session.\nAll associated Activity Tasks are then processed by the same Worker Entity.\n\n```go\nfunc YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, fileID string) (err error) {\n // ...\n sessionOptions := &workflow.SessionOptions{\n   CreationTimeout:  time.Minute,\n   ExecutionTimeout: time.Minute,\n }\n sessionCtx, err := workflow.CreateSession(ctx, sessionOptions)\n if err != nil {\n   return err\n }\n defer workflow.CompleteSession(sessionCtx)\n\n var activityResult1 *ActivityResult1\n err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(sessionCtx, ActivityFunction1, param1).Get(sessionCtx, &activityResult1)\n if err != nil {\n   return err\n }\n\n var activityResult2 *ActivityResult2\n err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(sessionCtx, ActivityFunction2, *activityResult1).Get(sessionCtx, &activityResult2)\n if err != nil {\n   return err\n }\n\n return workflow.ExecuteActivity(sessionCtx, uploadFileActivityName, *activityResult2).Get(sessionCtx, nil)\n}\n```\n\nWhen the `CreateSession` API is called, the Task Queue name that is specified in the `ActivityOptions` is used (or in the `StartWorkflowOptions` if the Task Queue name is not specified in `ActivityOptions`), and a Session is created with one of the Workers polling that Task Queue.\n\nThe Session Context is cancelled if the Worker executing this Session dies or `CompleteSession()` is called.\nWhen using the returned Session Context to spawn Activity Executions, a `workflow.ErrSessionFailed` error may be returned if the Session framework detects that the Worker executing this Session has died.\nThe failure of Activity Executions won't affect the state of the Session, so you still need to handle the errors returned from your Activities and call `CompleteSession()` if necessary.\n\n`CreateSession()` will return an error if the context passed in already contains an open Session.\nIf all the Workers are currently busy and unable to handle a new Session, the framework will keep retrying until the `CreationTimeout` you specified in `SessionOptions` has passed before returning an error (check the **Concurrent Session Limitation** section for more details).\n\n`CompleteSession()` releases the resources reserved on the Worker, so it's important to call it as soon as you no longer need the Session.\nIt will cancel the session context and therefore all the Activity Executions using that Session Context.\nNote that it's safe to call `CompleteSession()` on a failed Session, meaning that you can call it from a `defer` function after the Session is successfully created.\n\n#### Session metadata\n\n```go\ntype SessionInfo struct {\n // A unique Id for the session\n SessionID         string\n // The hostname of the worker that is executing the session\n HostName          string\n // ... other unexported fields\n}\n\nfunc GetSessionInfo(ctx Context) *SessionInfo\n```\n\nThe Session Context also stores some Session metadata, which can be retrieved by the `GetSessionInfo()` API.\nIf the Context passed in doesn't contain any Session metadata, this API will return a `nil` pointer.\n\n#### Limiting concurrent Sessions\n\nTo limit the number of concurrent Sessions running on a Worker, set the `MaxConcurrentSessionExecutionSize` field of `worker.Options` to the desired value.\nBy default, this field is set to a very large value, so there's no need to manually set it if no limitation is needed.\n\nIf a Worker hits this limitation, it won't accept any new `CreateSession()` requests until one of the existing sessions is completed. `CreateSession()` will return an error if the session can't be created within `CreationTimeout`.\n\n#### Recreate Session\n\nFor long-running Sessions, you may want to use the `ContinueAsNew` feature to split the Workflow into multiple runs when all Activities need to be executed by the same Worker.\nThe `RecreateSession()` API is designed for such a use case.\n\n```go\nfunc RecreateSession(ctx Context, recreateToken []byte, sessionOptions *SessionOptions) (Context, error)\n```\n\nIts usage is the same as `CreateSession()` except that it also takes in a `recreateToken`, which is needed to create a new Session on the same Worker as the previous one.\nYou can get the token by calling the `GetRecreateToken()` method of the `SessionInfo` object.\n\n```go\ntoken := workflow.GetSessionInfo(sessionCtx).GetRecreateToken()\n```\n\n**Is there a complete example?**\n\nYes, the [file processing example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/master/fileprocessing) in the [temporalio/samples-go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go) repo has been updated to use the session framework.\n\n**What happens to my Activity if the Worker dies?**\n\nIf your Activity has already been scheduled, it will be canceled.\nIf not, you will get a `workflow.ErrSessionFailed` error when you call `workflow.ExecuteActivity()`.\n\n**Is the concurrent session limitation per process or per host?**\n\nIt's per Worker Process, so make sure there's only one Worker Process running on the host if you plan to use this feature.\n\n**Future Work**\n\n- Right now, a Session is considered failed if the Worker Process dies.\n  However, for some use cases, you may only care whether the Worker host is alive or not.\n  For these use cases, the Session should be automatically re-established if the Worker Process is restarted.\n\n- The current implementation assumes that all Sessions are consuming the same type of resource and there's only one global limitation.\n  Our plan is to allow you to specify what type of resource your Session will consume and enforce different limitations on different types of resources.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-customize-activity-type-in-go.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/go/how-to-customize-activity-type-in-go.md","id":"go/how-to-customize-activity-type-in-go","title":"How

[`[]ClientInterceptor`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientInterceptor)  |\n\n### `HostPort`\n\n**How to set the Temporal Client's host:port connection in Go**\n\n- Type: `string`\n- Default: [`client.DefaultHostPort`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#pkg-constants) (127.0.0.1:7233)\n\n```go\nclientOptions := client.Options{\n  HostPort: client.DefaultHostPort,\n}\ntemporalClient, err := client.Dial(clientOptions)\n```\n\nThe `HostPort` value is a gRPC address and therefore can also support a special-formatted address of `<resolver>:///<value>` that will use a registered resolver.\nBy default all hosts returned from the resolver will be used in a round-robin fashion.\n\nThe \"dns\" resolver is registered by default.\nUsing a `dns:///` prefixed address will cause a periodic round-robin resolution of all IPs for all DNS addresses.\n\nA custom resolver can be created to provide multiple hosts in other ways.\nFor example, to manually provide multiple IPs to round-robin across, a `google.golang.org/grpc/resolver/` manual resolver can be created and registered with a custom scheme:\n\n```go\nbuilder := manual.NewBuilderWithScheme(\"myresolver\")\nbuilder.InitialState(resolver.State{Addresses: []resolver.Address{{Addr: \"1.2.3.4:1234\"},{Addr: \"2.3.4.5:2345\"}}})\nresolver.Register(builder)\ntemporalClient, err := client.Dial(client.Options{HostPort: \"myresolver:///ignoredvalue\"})\n```\n\nOther more advanced resolvers can also be registered.\n\n### `Namespace`\n\nimport Namespace from './how-to-set-the-namespace-for-a-temporal-client-in-go.md'\n\n<Namespace/>\n\n### `Logger`\n\n**How to use a custom logger in Go**\n\nThis field sets a custom Logger that is used for all logging actions of the instance of the Temporal Client.\n\nAlthough the Go SDK does not support most third-party logging solutions natively, [our friends at Banzai Cloud](https://github.com/sagikazarmark) built the adapter package [logur](https://github.com/logur/logur) which makes it possible to use third party loggers with minimal overhead.\nMost of the popular logging solutions have existing adapters in Logur, but you can find a full list [in the Logur Github project](https://github.com/logur?q=adapter-).\n\nHere is an example of using Logur to support [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus):\n\n```go\npackage main\nimport (\n  \"go.temporal.io/sdk/client\"\n\n\t\"github.com/sirupsen/logrus\"\n\tlogrusadapter \"logur.dev/adapter/logrus\"\n\t\"logur.dev/logur\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  // ...\n  logger := logur.LoggerToKV(logrusadapter.New(logrus.New()))\n  clientOptions := client.Options{\n    Logger: logger,\n  }\n  temporalClient, err := client.Dial(clientOptions)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### `MetricsHandler`\n\nSets the metric scope, which metrics should be reported\n\n- Type: [`metrics.Handler`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal/common/metrics#Handler)\n- Default: None\n\n### `Identity`\n\nSets an identify that can be used to track this host for debugging\n\n### `DataConverter`\n\nSets DataConverter to customize serialization/deserialization of arguments in Temporal\n\n- Type: [`converter.DataConverter`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#DataConverter)\n\n### `ContextPropagators`\n\nSets ContextPropagators that allows users to control the context information passed through a Workflow\n\n- Type: `[]ContextPropagator`\n\n### `ConnectionOptions`\n\nSets options for server connection that allow users to control features of connections such as TLS settings\n\n- Type: `ConnectionOptions`\n\n### `HeadersProvider`\n\nSets custom request headers\n\n- Type: `HeadersProvider`\n\n### `TrafficController`\n\nSet to induce artificial failures in test scenarios\n\n- Type: `TrafficController`\n\n### `Interceptors`\n\ngRPC interceptors that are applied to every RPC call performed by this connection.\nBy default, an interceptor is included; it automatically retries retryable errors.\nIf you do not want to perform automatic retries, set this to an empty list (or a list with your own interceptors).\n\n- Type: `[]ClientInterceptor`\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-set-connectionoptions-in-go.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/go/how-to-set-connectionoptions-in-go.md","id":"go/how-to-set-connectionoptions-in-go","title":"How

default.\n\nIntended use case is to limit resources used by the Worker.\n\nNotice that the value type is a float so that the value can be less than 1 if needed.\nFor example, if set to 0.1, Activity Task Executions will happen once every ten seconds.\nThis can be used to protect down stream services from flooding with requests.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions :=

...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tMaxConcurrentLocalActivityExecutionSize: 1000,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `WorkerLocalActivitiesPerSecond`\n\nRate limits the number of Local Activity Executions per second executed for the Worker.\n\n- Type: `float64`\n- Default: `100000`\n\nA value of `0` sets to the default value.\n\nIntended use case is to limit resources used by the Worker.\n\nNotice that the value type is a float so that the value can be less than 1 if needed.\nFor example, if set to 0.1, Local Activity Task Executions will happen once every ten seconds.\nThis can be used to protect down stream services from flooding with requests.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions :=

the number of Activity Executions that can be started per second.\n\n- Type: `float64`\n- Default: `100000`\n\nA value of `0` sets to the default value.\n\nThis rate is managed by the Temporal Cluster and limits the Activity Tasks per second for the entire Task Queue. This is in contrast to [`WorkerActivityTasksPerSecond`](#workeractivitytaskspersecond) controls activities only per Worker.\n\nNotice that the number is represented in float, so that you can set it to less than 1 if needed.\nFor example, set the number to 0.1 means you want your Activity to be executed once for every 10 seconds.\nThis can be used to protect down stream services from flooding.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tTaskQueueActivitiesPerSecond: 100000,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `MaxConcurrentActivityTaskPollers`\n\nSets the maximum number of goroutines to concurrently poll the Task Queue for Activity Tasks.\n\n- Type: `int`\n- Default: `2`\n\nChanging this value will affect

...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tMaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPollers: 2,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `EnableLoggingInReplay`\n\nSet to enable logging in Workflow Execution replays.\n\n- type: `bool`\n- Default: `false`\n\nIn Workflow Definitions you can use [`workflow.GetLogger(ctx)`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLogger) to write logs.\nBy default, the logger will skip logging during replays, so you do not see duplicate logs.\n\nThis is only really useful for debugging purpose.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tEnableLoggingInReplay: false,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `DisableStickyExecution`\n\n:::caution Deprecated\n\nWhen DisableStickyExecution is `true` it can harm performance.\nIt will be removed soon.\nSee [`SetStickyWorkflowCacheSize`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#SetStickyWorkflowCacheSize) instead.\n\n:::\n\nSet to disable Sticky Executions\n\n- Type: `bool`\n- Default: `false`\n\nSticky Execution runs Workflow Tasks of a Workflow Execution on same host (could be a different Worker, as long as it is on the same host).\nThis is an optimization for Workflow Executions.\nWhen sticky execution is enabled, Worker keeps the Workflow state in memory.\nNew Workflow Task contains the new history events will be dispatched to the same Worker.\nIf this Worker crashes, the sticky Workflow Task will timeout after `StickyScheduleToStartTimeout`, and Temporal Cluster will clear the stickiness for that Workflow Execution and automatically reschedule a new Workflow Task that is available for any Worker to pick up and resume the progress.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tStickyScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Second(5),\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `StickyScheduleToStartTimeout`\n\nSets the Sticky Execution Schedule-To-Start Timeout for Workflow Tasks.\n\n- Type: [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration)\n- Default value is `5`\n\nThe resolution is in seconds.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tStickyScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Second(5),\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `BackgroundActivityContext`\n\n:::caution Not recommended\n\nThis method of passing dependencies between Activity Task Executions is not recommended anymore.\n\nInstead, we recommend using a struct with fields that contain dependencies and [develop Activity Definitions](/application-development/foundations#develop-activities) as struct methods and then pass all the dependencies on the structure initialization.\n\n:::\n\n- Type: [`context.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context)\n\nSets the background `context.Context` for all Activity Types registered with the Worker.\n\nThe context can be used to pass external dependencies such as database connections to Activity Task Executions.\n\n```go\n// ...\nctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), \"your-key\", \"your-value\")\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tBackgroundActivityContext: ctx,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `WorkflowPanicPolicy`\n\nSets how the Workflow Worker handles a non-deterministic Workflow Execution History Event and other panics from Workflow Definition code.\n\n- Type: [`WorkflowPanicPolicy`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#WorkflowPanicPolicy)\n- Default: `BlockWorkflow`\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tDisableStickyExecution: internal.BlockWorkflow,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `WorkerStopTimeout`\n\nSets the Worker's graceful stop timeout\n\n- Type: [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration)\n- Default: `0`\n\nValue resolution is in seconds.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tWorkerStopTimeout: time.Second(0),\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `EnableSessionWorker`\n\nEnables Sessions for Activity Workers.\n\n- Type: `bool`\n- Default: `false`\n\nWhen `true` the Activity Worker creates a Session to sequentially process Activity Tasks for the given Task Queue.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tEnableSessionWorker: true,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `MaxConcurrentSessionExecutionSize`\n\nSets the maximum number of concurrent Sessions that the Worker can support.\n\n- Type: `int`\n- Default: 1000\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tMaxConcurrentSessionExecutionSize: 1000,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `WorkflowInterceptorChainFactories`\n\nSpecifies the factories used to instantiate the Workflow interceptor chain.\n\n- Type: [`[]WorkflowInterceptor`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#WorkflowInterceptor)\n\nThe chain is instantiated for each replay of a Workflow Execution.\n\n### `LocalActivityWorkerOnly`\n\nSets the Worker to only handle Workflow Tasks and local Activity Tasks.\n\n- Type: `bool`\n- Default: `false`\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tLocalActivityWorkerOnly: 1000,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `Identity`\n\nSets the Temporal Client-level Identity value, overwriting the existing one.\n\n- Type: string\n- Default: client identity\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tIdentity: \"your_custom_identity\",\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n### `DeadlockDetectionTimeout`\n\nSets the maximum time that a Workflow Task can execute for.\n\n- Type: [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration)\n- Default: 1\n\nResolution is in seconds.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tDeadlockDetectionTimeout: time.Second(1),\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n//

[`workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ChildWorkflowOptions) applied to it, the Workflow Type, and any parameters that should be passed to the Child Workflow Execution.\n\n`workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions` contain the same fields as `client.StartWorkflowOptions`.\nWorkflow Option fields automatically inherit their values from the Parent Workflow Options if they are not explicitly set.\nIf a custom `WorkflowID` is not set, one is generated when the Child Workflow Execution is spawned.\nUse the [`WithChildOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#WithChildOptions) API to apply Child Workflow Options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.\n\nThe `ExecuteChildWorkflow` call returns an instance of a [`ChildWorkflowFuture`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ChildWorkflowFuture).\n\nCall the `.Get()` method on the instance of `ChildWorkflowFuture` to wait for the result.\n\n```go\nfunc YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ParentParams) (ParentResp, error) {\n\n  childWorkflowOptions := workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions{}\n  ctx = workflow.WithChildOptions(ctx, childWorkflowOptions)\n\n  var result ChildResp\n  err := workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow(ctx, YourOtherWorkflowDefinition, ChildParams{}).Get(ctx, &result)\n  if err != nil {\n    // ...\n  }\n  // ...\n  return resp, nil\n}\n\nfunc YourOtherWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ChildParams) (ChildResp, error) {\n  // ...\n  return resp, nil\n}\n```\n\nTo asynchronously spawn a Child Workflow Execution, the Child Workflow must have an \"Abandon\" Parent Close Policy set in the Child Workflow Options.\nAdditionally, the Parent Workflow Execution must wait for the `ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted` Event to appear in its Event History before it completes.\n\nIf the Parent makes the `ExecuteChildWorkflow` call and then immediately completes, the Child Workflow Execution does not spawn.\n\nTo be sure that the Child Workflow Execution has started, first call the `GetChildWorkflowExecution` method on the instance of the `ChildWorkflowFuture`, which will return a different Future.\nThen call the `Get()` method on that Future, which is what will wait until the Child Workflow Execution has spawned.\n\n```go\nimport (\n  // ...\n  \"go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1\"\n)\n\nfunc YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ParentParams) (ParentResp, error) {\n\n  childWorkflowOptions := workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions{\n

YourOtherWorkflowDefinition, ChildParams{})\n  // Wait for the Child Workflow Execution to spawn\n  var childWE workflow.Execution\n  if err := childWorkflowFuture.GetChildWorkflowExecution().Get(ctx, &childWE); err != nil {\n     return err\n  }\n  // ...\n  return resp, nil\n}\n\nfunc YourOtherWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ChildParams) (ChildResp, error) {\n  // ...\n  return resp, nil\n}\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-go.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/go/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-go.md","id":"go/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-go","title":"How

TestUnitTestSuite(t *testing.T) {\n        suite.Run(t, new(UnitTestSuite))\n}\n```\n\n#### Setup\n\nTo run unit tests, we first define a test suite struct that absorbs both the\nbasic suite functionality from [testify](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite)\nvia `suite.Suite` and the suite functionality from the Temporal test framework via\n`testsuite.WorkflowTestSuite`. Because every test in this test suite will test our Workflow, we\nadd a property to our struct to hold an instance of the test environment. This allows us to initialize\nthe test environment in a setup method. For testing Workflows, we use a `testsuite.TestWorkflowEnvironment`.\n\nNext, we implement a `SetupTest` method to set up a new test environment before each test. Doing so\nensures that each test runs in its own isolated sandbox. We also implement an `AfterTest` function\nwhere we assert that all the mocks we set up were indeed called by invoking `s.env.AssertExpectations(s.T())`.\n\nTimeout for the entire test can be set using `SetTestTimeout` in the Workflow or Activity environment.\n\nFinally, we create a regular test function recognized by the `go test` command, and pass the struct to `suite.Run`.\n\n#### A Simple Test\n\nThe simplest test case we can write is to have the test environment execute the Workflow and then\nevaluate the results.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_Success() {\n        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, \"test_success\")\n\n        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n        s.NoError(s.env.GetWorkflowError())\n}\n```\n\nCalling `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` executes the Workflow logic and any invoked Activities inside the\ntest process. The first parameter of `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` contains the Workflow functions,\nand any subsequent parameters contain values for custom input parameters declared by the Workflow\nfunction.\n\n> Note that unless the Activity invocations are mocked or Activity implementation\n> replaced (see [Activity mocking and overriding](#activity-mocking-and-overriding)), the test environment\n> will execute the actual Activity code including any calls to outside services.\n\nAfter executing the Workflow in the above example, we assert that the Workflow ran through completion\nvia the call to `s.env.IsWorkflowComplete()`. We also assert that no errors were returned by asserting\non the return value of `s.env.GetWorkflowError()`. If our Workflow returned a value, we could have\nretrieved that value via a call to `s.env.GetWorkflowResult(&value)` and had additional asserts on that\nvalue.\n\n#### Activity mocking and overriding\n\nWhen running unit tests on Workflows, we want to test the Workflow logic in isolation. Additionally,\nwe want to inject Activity errors during our test runs. The test framework provides two mechanisms\nthat support these scenarios: Activity mocking and Activity overriding. Both of these mechanisms allow\nyou to change the behavior of Activities invoked by your Workflow without the need to modify the actual\nWorkflow code.\n\nLet's take a look at a test that simulates a test that fails via the \"Activity mocking\" mechanism.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_ActivityFails() {\n        s.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(\n          \"\", errors.New(\"SimpleActivityFailure\"))\n        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, \"test_failure\")\n\n        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n\n        err := s.env.GetWorkflowError()\n        s.Error(err)\n        var applicationErr *temporal.ApplicationError\n        s.True(errors.As(err, &applicationErr))\n        s.Equal(\"SimpleActivityFailure\", applicationErr.Error())\n}\n```\n\nThis test simulates the execution of the Activity `SimpleActivity` that is invoked by our Workflow\n`SimpleWorkflow` returning an error. We accomplish this by setting up a mock on the test environment\nfor the `SimpleActivity` that returns an error.\n\n```go\ns.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(\n  \"\", errors.New(\"SimpleActivityFailure\"))\n```\n\nWith the mock set up we can now execute the Workflow via the `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` method and\nassert that the Workflow completed successfully and returned the expected error.\n\nSimply mocking the execution to return a desired value or error is a pretty powerful mechanism to\nisolate Workflow logic. However, sometimes we want to replace the Activity with an alternate implementation\nto support a more complex test scenario. Let's assume we want to validate that the Activity gets called\nwith the correct parameters.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_ActivityParamCorrect() {\n        s.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(\n          func(ctx context.Context, value string) (string, error) {\n                s.Equal(\"test_success\", value)\n                return value, nil\n        })\n        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, \"test_success\")\n\n        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n        s.NoError(s.env.GetWorkflowError())\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we provide a function implementation as the parameter to `Return`. This allows us to\nprovide an alternate implementation for the Activity `SimpleActivity`. The framework will execute this\nfunction whenever the Activity is invoked and pass on the return value from the function as the result\nof the Activity invocation. Additionally, the framework will validate that the signature of the \"mock\"\nfunction matches the signature of the original Activity function.\n\nSince this can be an entire function, there is no limitation as to what we can do here. In this\nexample, we assert that the `value` param has the same content as the value param we passed to the Workflow.\n\n#### Queries\n\n`TestWorkflowEnvironment` instances have a [`QueryWorkflow()` method](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/temporal/internal#TestWorkflowEnvironment.QueryWorkflow) that lets you query the state of the currently running Workflow.\nFor example, suppose you have a Workflow that lets you query the progress of a long running task as shown below.\n\n```go\nfunc ProgressWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, percent int) error {\n\tlogger := workflow.GetLogger(ctx)\n\n\terr := workflow.SetQueryHandler(ctx, \"getProgress\", func(input []byte) (int, error) {\n\t\treturn percent, nil\n\t})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlogger.Info(\"SetQueryHandler failed.\", \"Error\", err)\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\n\tfor percent = 0; percent<100; percent++ {\n                // Important! Use `workflow.Sleep()`, not `time.Sleep()`, because Temporal's\n                // test environment doesn't stub out `time.Sleep()`.\n\t\tworkflow.Sleep(ctx, time.Second*1)\n\t}\n\n\treturn nil\n}\n```\n\nThis Workflow tracks the current progress of a task in percentage terms, and increments the percentage by 1 every second.\nBelow is how you would write a test case that queries this Workflow.\nNote that you should always query the Workflow either after `ExecuteWorkflow()` is done or in a `RegisterDelayedCallback()` callback, otherwise you'll get a `runtime error` panic.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_ProgressWorkflow() {\n\tvalue := 0\n\n\t// After 10 seconds plus padding, progress should be 10.\n\t// Note that `RegisterDelayedCallback()` doesn't actually make your test wait for 10 seconds!\n\t// Temporal's test framework advances time internally, so this test should take < 1 second.\n\ts.env.RegisterDelayedCallback(func() {\n\t\tres, err := s.env.QueryWorkflow(\"getProgress\")\n\t\ts.NoError(err)\n\t\terr = res.Get(&value)\n\t\ts.NoError(err)\n\t\ts.Equal(10, value)\n\t}, time.Second*10+time.Millisecond*1)\n\n\ts.env.ExecuteWorkflow(ProgressWorkflow, 0)\n\n\ts.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n\n\t// Once the workflow is completed, progress should always be 100\n\tres, err := s.env.QueryWorkflow(\"getProgress\")\n\ts.NoError(err)\n\terr = res.Get(&value)\n\ts.NoError(err)\n\ts.Equal(value, 100)\n}\n```\n\n:::note\n\n`RegisterDelayedCallback` can also be used to send [Signals](/concepts/what-is-a-signal).\nWhen using \"Signal-With-Start\", set the delay to `0`.\n:::\n\n#### Debugging\n\nYou can use a debugger tool provided by your favorite IDE to debug your Workflow Definitions prior to testing or executing them.\n\nThe Temporal Go SDK includes deadlock detection which fails a Workflow Task in case the code blocks over a second without relinquishing execution control.\nBecause of this you can often encounter a `PanicError: Potential deadlock detected` while stepping through Workflow Definitions during debugging.\n\nTo alleviate this issue, you can set the `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` environment variable to `true` before debugging your Workflow Definition.\n\n:::note\n\nMake sure to set `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` to true only during debugging.\n\n:::\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-upsert-custom-search-attributes-to-a-workflow-executions-during-execution-in-go.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/go/how-to-upsert-custom-search-attributes-to-a-workflow-executions-during-execution-in-go.md","id":"go/how-to-upsert-custom-search-attributes-to-a-workflow-executions-during-execution-in-go","title":"How

Searchable Attributes in Go","label":"Search Attributes","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n## Overview\n\nSearch Attributes enable complex and business-logic-focused search queries for Workflow Executions.\nThese are often queried through the Temporal Web UI, but you can also query from within your Workflow code.\n\nMany [Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute) are added to Workflow Executions by default.\nBut these are necessarily focused on Temporal internal state tracking.\n\nFor more debugging and monitoring, you might want to add your own domain-specific Search Attributes, such as `customerId` or `numItems`, that can serve as useful search filters.\n\nThe [Go SDK Client](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client) offers APIs for configuring Search Attributes.\nThere are also APIs on the SDK client for listing Workflows by status.\nGo samples for Search Attributes can be found at [`temporalio/samples-go`](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/master/searchattributes).\n\n## Value types\n\nHere are the [Search Attribute value types](/visibility#types) and their corresponding types in Go:\n\n- Bool = bool\n- Datetime = time.Time\n- Double = float64\n- Int = int64\n- Keyword = string\n- Text = string\n\n## Tagging Search Attributes at Workflow creation\n\nYou can provide key-value pairs as Search Attributes in [StartWorkflowOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#StartWorkflowOptions).\nIn Go, Search Attributes are represented as `map[string]interface{}`.\nThe value provided in the map must be the same type that was added to a Cluster.\n\nThis can be useful for tagging executions with useful attributes you may want to search up later. For example:\n\n```go\nfunc (c *Client) CallYourWorkflow(ctx context.Context, workflowID string, payload map[string]interface{}) error {\n    // ...\n    searchAttributes := map[string]interface{}{\n        \"CustomerId\": payload[\"customer\"],\n        \"MiscData\": payload[\"miscData\"]\n    }\n    options := client.StartWorkflowOptions{\n        ID:                 workflowID,\n        TaskQueue:          app.MyTaskQueue,\n        SearchAttributes:   searchAttributes\n    }\n    we, err := c.Client.ExecuteWorkflow(ctx, options, app.YourWorkflow, payload)\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Upsert Search Attributes during Workflow Execution\n\nIn advanced cases, you may want to dynamically update these attributes as the Workflow progresses.\n[UpsertSearchAttributes](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#UpsertSearchAttributes) is used to add or update Search Attributes from within Workflow code.\n\n`UpsertSearchAttributes` will merge attributes to the existing map in the Workflow.\nConsider this example Workflow code:\n\n```go\nfunc YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, input string) error {\n\n    attr1 := map[string]interface{}{\n        \"CustomIntField\": 1,\n        \"CustomBoolField\": true,\n    }\n    workflow.UpsertSearchAttributes(ctx, attr1)\n\n    attr2 := map[string]interface{}{\n        \"CustomIntField\": 2,\n        \"CustomKeywordField\": \"seattle\",\n    }\n    workflow.UpsertSearchAttributes(ctx, attr2)\n}\n```\n\nAfter the second call to `UpsertSearchAttributes`, the map will contain:\n\n```go\nmap[string]interface{}{\n    \"CustomIntField\": 2, // last update wins\n    \"CustomBoolField\": true,\n    \"CustomKeywordField\": \"seattle\",\n}\n```\n\n## Removing Search Attributes\n\n**There is no support for removing a field.**\n\nHowever, to achieve a similar effect, set the field to some placeholder value.\nFor example, you could set `CustomKeywordField` to `impossibleVal`.\nThen searching `CustomKeywordField != 'impossibleVal'` will match Workflows with `CustomKeywordField` not equal to `impossibleVal`, which includes Workflows without the `CustomKeywordField` set.\n\n## Retrieving Search Attributes\n\nUse the `SearchAttributes` property of `workflow.GetInfo` to get a specific Search Attribute:\n\n```go\n// Get search attributes that were provided when workflow was started.\ninfo := workflow.GetInfo(ctx)\nval := info.SearchAttributes.IndexedFields[\"CustomIntField\"]\n```\n\n## Querying Search Attributes within a Workflow\n\nYou can programmatically retrieve attributes from a Workflow Execution with `GetSearchAttributes`, and log out all fields with `GetIndexedFields`:\n\n```go\nsearchAttributes := workflowExecution.GetSearchAttributes()\nvar builder strings.Builder\nfor k, v := range searchAttributes.GetIndexedFields() {\n    var currentVal interface{}\n    err := converter.GetDefaultDataConverter().FromPayload(v, &currentVal)\n    if err != nil {\n        logger.Error(fmt.Sprintf(\"Get search attribute for key %s failed.\", k), \"Error\", err)\n        return err\n    }\n    builder.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(\"%s=%v\\n\", k, currentVal))\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Search Attributes\n\nThe Go SDK's test suite comes with corresponding methods for mocking and asserting these operations:\n\n```go\nfunc Test_Workflow(t *testing.T) {\n\ttestSuite := &testsuite.WorkflowTestSuite{}\n\tenv := testSuite.NewTestWorkflowEnvironment()\n\tenv.RegisterActivity(ListExecutions)\n\n\t// mock search attributes on start\n\t_ = env.SetSearchAttributesOnStart(map[string]interface{}{\"CustomIntField\": 1})\n\n\t// mock upsert operations\n\tattributes := map[string]interface{}{\n\t\t\"CustomIntField\":      2, // update CustomIntField from 1 to 2, then insert other fields\n\t\t\"CustomKeywordField\":  \"Update1\",\n\t\t\"CustomBoolField\":     true,\n\t\t\"CustomDoubleField\":   3.14,\n\t\t\"CustomDatetimeField\": env.Now().UTC(),\n\t\t\"CustomStringField\":   \"String field is for text. When query, it will be tokenized for partial match. StringTypeField cannot be used in Order By\",\n\t}\n\tenv.OnUpsertSearchAttributes(attributes).Return(nil).Once()\n\n\tattributes = map[string]interface{}{\n\t\t\"CustomKeywordField\": \"Update2\",\n\t}\n\tenv.OnUpsertSearchAttributes(attributes).Return(nil).Once()\n\n\t// mock activity\n\tenv.OnActivity(ListExecutions, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return([]*workflowpb.WorkflowExecutionInfo{{}}, nil).Once()\n\n\tenv.ExecuteWorkflow(SearchAttributesWorkflow)\n\trequire.True(t, env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n\trequire.NoError(t, env.GetWorkflowError())\n}\n```\n\n## Full Search Attributes example code\n\nYou can find full example Search Attributes sample code [in the Temporal `samples-go` repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/master/searchattributes).\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"selectors.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/go/selectors.md","id":"go/selectors","title":"Go SDK Selectors","label":"Selectors","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n## Overview\n\nIn Go, the `select` statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.\nA `select` **blocks until one of its cases can run**, then it executes that case.\nIt chooses one at random if multiple are ready.\n\nHowever, a normal Go select statement can not be used inside of Workflows directly because of the random nature.\nTemporal's Go SDK `Selector`s are similar and act as a replacement.\nThey can block on sending and receiving from Channels but as a bonus can listen on Future deferred work.\nUsage of Selectors to defer and process work (in place of Go's `select`) are necessary in order to ensure deterministic Workflow code execution (though using `select` in Activity code is fine).\n\n## Full API Example\n\nThe API is sufficiently different from `select` that it bears documenting:\n\n```go\nfunc SampleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) error {\n\t// standard Workflow setup code omitted...\n\n\t// API Example: declare a new selector\n\tselector := workflow.NewSelector(ctx)\n\n\t// API Example: defer code execution until the Future that represents Activity result is ready\n\twork := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ExampleActivity)\n\tselector.AddFuture(work, func(f workflow.Future) {\n\t\t// deferred code omitted...\n\t})\n\n\t// more parallel timers and activities initiated...\n\n\t// API Example: receive information from a Channel\n\tvar signalVal string\n\tchannel := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, channelName)\n\tselector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {\n\t\t// matching on the channel doesn't consume the message.\n\t \t// So it has to be explicitly consumed here\n\t\tc.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)\n\t\t// do something with received information\n\t})\n\n\t// API Example: block until the next Future is ready to run\n\t// important! none of the deferred code runs until you call selector.Select\n\tselector.Select(ctx)\n\n\t// Todo: document selector.HasPending\n}\n```\n\n## Using Selectors with Futures\n\nYou usually add `Future`s after `Activities`:\n\n```go\n// API Example: defer code execution until after an activity is done\nwork := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ExampleActivity)\nselector.AddFuture(work, func(f workflow.Future) {\n\t// deferred code omitted...\n})\n```\n\n`selector.Select(ctx)` is the primary mechanism which blocks on and executes `Future` work.\nIt is intentionally flexible; you may call it conditionally or multiple times:\n\n```go\n\t// API Example: blocking conditionally\n  if somecondition != nil {\n\t\tselector.Select(ctx)\n  }\n\n\t// API Example: popping off all remaining Futures\n  for i := 0; i < len(someArray); i++ {\n\t\tselector.Select(ctx) // this will wait for one branch\n\t\t// you can interrupt execution here\n\t}\n```\n\nA Future matches only once per Selector instance even if Select is called multiple times.\nIf multiple items are available, the order of matching is not defined.\n\n### Using Selectors with Timers\n\nAn important use case of futures is setting up a race between a timer and a pending activity, effectively adding a \"soft\" timeout that doesn't result in any errors or retries of that activity.\n\nFor example, [the Timer sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/master/timer) shows how you can write a long running order processing operation where:\n\n- if processing takes too long, we send out a notification email to user about the delay, but we won't cancel the operation\n- if the operation finishes before the timer fires, then we want to cancel the timer.\n\n```go\nvar processingDone bool\nf := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, OrderProcessingActivity)\nselector.AddFuture(f, func(f workflow.Future) {\n\tprocessingDone = true\n\t// cancel timerFuture\n\tcancelHandler()\n})\n\n// use

{\n\tif !processingDone {\n\t\t// processing is not done yet when timer fires, send notification email\n\t\t_ = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, SendEmailActivity).Get(ctx, nil)\n\t}\n})\n\n// wait the timer or the order processing to finish\nselector.Select(ctx)\n```\n\nWe create timers with the `workflow.NewTimer` API.\n\n## Using Selectors with Channels\n\n`selector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {})` is the primary mechanism which receives messages from `Channels`.\n\n```go\n// API Example: receive information from a Channel\nvar signalVal string\nchannel := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, channelName)\nselector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {\n\tc.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)\n\t// do something with received information\n})\n```\n\nMerely matching on the channel doesn't consume the message; it has to be explicitly consumed with a `c.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)` call.\n\n## Querying Selector State\n\nYou can use the `selector.HasPending` API to ensure that signals are not lost when a Workflow is closed (e.g. by `ContinueAsNew`).\n\n## Learn More\n\nUsage of Selectors is best learned by example:\n\n-

Execution.\n\n`workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions` contain the same fields as `client.StartWorkflowOptions`.\nWorkflow Option fields automatically inherit their values from the Parent Workflow Options if they are not explicitly set.\nIf a custom `WorkflowID` is not set, one is generated when the Child Workflow Execution is spawned.\nUse the [`WithChildOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#WithChildOptions) API to apply Child Workflow Options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.\n\nThe `ExecuteChildWorkflow` call

Propagation","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n## Tracing\n\nThe Go SDK provides support for distributed tracing through [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/).\nTracing allows you to view the call graph of a Workflow along with its Activities and any Child Workflows.\n\nTracing can be configured by providing an [opentracing.Tracer](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go#Tracer)\nimplementation in [ClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions) during client instantiation.\nFor more details on how to configure and leverage tracing, see the [OpenTracing documentation](https://opentracing.io/docs/getting-started/).\n\nThe OpenTracing support has been validated using [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), but other implementations mentioned [here](https://opentracing.io/docs/supported-tracers/) should also work.\nTracing functionality utilizes generic context propagation provided by the client.\n\n## Context Propagation\n\nTemporal provides a standard way to propagate a custom context across a Workflow.\nYou can configure a context propagator in via the [ClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions).\nThe context propagator extracts and passes on information present in `context.Context` and `workflow.Context` objects across the Workflow.\nOnce a context propagator is configured, you should be able to access the required values in the context objects as you would normally do in Go.\nYou can see how the Go SDK implements a [tracing context propagator](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/internal/tracer.go).\n\n### Server-Side Headers\n\nOn the server side, Temporal provides a mechanism for propagating context across Workflow transitions called headers.\n\n```proto\nmessage Header {\n    map<string, Payload> fields = 1;\n}\n```\n\n`Client` leverages headers to pass around additional context information.\n[HeaderReader](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#HeaderReader) and [HeaderWriter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#HeaderWriter) are interfaces that allow reading and writing to the Temporal Server headers.\nThe SDK includes [implementations](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/internal/headers.go) for these interfaces.\n`HeaderWriter` sets a value for a header.\nHeaders are held as a map, so setting a value for the same key will overwrite its previous value.\n`HeaderReader` gets a value of a header.\nIt also can iterate through all headers and execute the provided handler function on each header, so that your code can operate on select headers you need.\n\n```go\ntype HeaderWriter interface {\n\tSet(string, *commonpb.Payload)\n}\n\ntype HeaderReader interface {\n\tGet(string) (*commonpb.Payload, bool)\n\tForEachKey(handler func(string, *commonpb.Payload) error) error\n}\n```\n\n### Context Propagators\n\nYou can propagate additional context through Workflow Execution by using a context propagator.\nA context propagator needs to implement the `ContextPropagator` interface that includes the following four methods:\n\n```go\ntype ContextPropagator interface {\n  Inject(context.Context, HeaderWriter) error\n\n  Extract(context.Context, HeaderReader) (context.Context, error)\n\n  InjectFromWorkflow(Context, HeaderWriter) error\n\n  ExtractToWorkflow(Context, HeaderReader) (Context, error)\n}\n```\n\n- `Inject` reads select context keys from a Go [context.Context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/#Context) object and writes them into the headers using the [HeaderWriter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#HeaderWriter) interface.\n- `InjectFromWorkflow` operates similar to `Inject` but reads from a [workflow.Context](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#Context) object.\n- `Extract` picks select headers and put their values into the [context.Context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/#Context) object.\n- `ExtractToWorkflow` operates similar to `Extract` but write to a [workflow.Context](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#Context) object.\n\nThe [tracing context propagator](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/internal/tracer.go) shows a sample implementation of a context propagator.\n\n### Is there a complete example?\n\nThe [context propagation sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/master/ctxpropagation/) configures a custom context propagator and shows context propagation of custom keys across a Workflow and an Activity.\nIt also uses Jaeger for tracing.\n\n### Can I configure multiple context propagators?\n\nYes. Multiple context propagators help to structure code with each propagator having its own scope of responsibility.\n\n## Useful Resources\n\n- [Passing Context with

Definition.\nSignals can then be sent via the Temporal Client or from within a Workflow.\n\n### Define Signal type\n\nStructs should be used to define Signals and carry data, as long as the struct is [serializable via the Data Converter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#CompositeDataConverter.ToPayload).\nThe `Receive()` method on the Data Converter decodes the data into the Struct

Channel.\nGet a new [`Selector`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Selector) and pass it the Signal Channel and a callback function to handle the payload.\n\n```go\nfunc YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {\n  // ...\n  var signal MySignal\n  signalChan := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, \"your-signal-name\")\n  selector :=

len(signal.Message) > 0 && signal.Message != \"SOME_VALUE\" {\n      return errors.New(\"signal\")\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the Workflow code uses `workflow.GetSignalChannel` to open a `workflow.Channel` for the Signal type (identified by the Signal name).\nWe then use a [`workflow.Selector`](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/go/selectors) and the `AddReceive()` to wait on a Signal from this channel.\nThe `more` bool in the callback function indicates that channel is not closed and more deliveries are possible.\n\nBefore completing the Workflow or using [Continue-As-New](/application-development/features#continue-as-new), make sure to do an asynchronous drain on the Signal channel.\nOtherwise, the Signals will be lost.\n\n### Send Signal from Temporal Client\n\nUse the `SignalWorkflow()` method on an instance of the [Go SDK Temporal Client](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client) to send a [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal) to a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution).\n\nPass in both the [Workflow Id](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id) and [Run Id](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id) to uniquely identify the Workflow Execution.\nIf only the Workflow Id is supplied (provide an empty string as the Run Id param), the Workflow Execution that is Running receives the Signal.\n\n```go\n// ...\nsignal := MySignal {\n  Message: \"Some important data\",\n}\nerr = temporalClient.SignalWorkflow(context.Background(), \"your-workflow-id\", runID, \"your-signal-name\", signal)\nif err != nil {\n\tlog.Fatalln(\"Error

Workflow\n\nA Signal can be sent from within a Workflow to a different Workflow Execution using the [`SignalExternalWorkflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#SignalExternalWorkflow) API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package.\n\n```go\n// ...\nfunc YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {\n  //...\n  signal := MySignal {\n    Message:

time.\n\nBecause the Workflow Execution might not exist, this API does not take a Run ID as a parameter\n\n```go\n// ...\nsignal := MySignal {\n  Message: \"Some important data\",\n}\nerr =

definition code of a Temporal Workflow must be deterministic because Temporal uses event sourcing\nto reconstruct the Workflow state by replaying the saved history event data on the Workflow\ndefinition code. This means that any incompatible update to the Workflow Definition code could cause\na non-deterministic issue if not handled correctly.\n\n## Introduction to Versioning\n\nBecause we design for potentially long running Workflows at scale, versioning with Temporal works differently. We explain more in this optional 30 minute introduction: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY)\n\n## workflow.GetVersion()\n\nConsider the following Workflow Definition:\n\n```go\nfunc YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, data string) (string, error) {\n        ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{\n                ScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Minute,\n                StartToCloseTimeout:    time.Minute,\n        }\n        ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)\n        var result1 string\n        err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n        if err != nil {\n                return \"\", err\n        }\n        var result2 string\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityB, result1).Get(ctx, &result2)\n        return result2, err\n}\n```\n\nNow let's say we have replaced ActivityA with ActivityC, and deployed the updated code. If there\nis an existing Workflow Execution that was started by the original version of the Workflow code, where\nActivityA had already completed and the result was recorded to history, the new version of the Workflow\ncode will pick up that Workflow Execution and try to resume from there. However, the Workflow will fail\nbecause the new code expects a result for ActivityC from the history data, but instead it gets the\nresult for ActivityA. This causes the Workflow to fail on the non-deterministic error.\n\nThus we use `workflow.GetVersion().`\n\n```go\nvar err error\nv := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, \"Step1\", workflow.DefaultVersion, 1)\nif v == workflow.DefaultVersion {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n} else {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityC, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n}\nif err != nil {\n        return \"\", err\n}\n\nvar result2 string\nerr = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityB, result1).Get(ctx, &result2)\nreturn result2, err\n```\n\nWhen `workflow.GetVersion()` is run for the new Workflow Execution, it records a marker in the Workflow history so that all future calls to `GetVersion` for this change Id—`Step 1` in the example—on this Workflow Execution will always return the given version number, which is `1` in the example.\n\nIf you make an additional change, such as replacing ActivityC with ActivityD, you need to\nadd some additional code:\n\n```go\nv := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, \"Step1\", workflow.DefaultVersion, 2)\nif v == workflow.DefaultVersion {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n} else if v == 1 {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityC, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n} else {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n}\n```\n\nNote that we have changed `maxSupported` from 1 to 2. A Workflow that had already passed this\n`GetVersion()` call before it was introduced will return `DefaultVersion`. A Workflow that was run\nwith `maxSupported` set to 1, will return 1. New Workflows will return 2.\n\nAfter you are sure that all of the Workflow Executions prior to version 1 have completed, you can remove the code for that version.\nIt should now look like the following:\n\n```go\nv := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, \"Step1\", 1, 2)\nif v == 1 {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityC, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n} else {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n}\n```\n\nYou'll note that `minSupported` has changed from `DefaultVersion` to `1`.\nIf an older version of the Workflow Execution history is replayed on this code, it fails because the minimum expected version is 1.\nAfter you are sure that all of the Workflow Executions for version 1 have completed, you can remove version 1 so that your code looks like the following:\n\n```go\n_ := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, \"Step1\", 2, 2)\nerr = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n```\n\nNote that we have preserved the call to `GetVersion()`. There are two reasons to preserve this call:\n\n1. This ensures that if there is a Workflow Execution still running for an older version, it will\n   fail here and not proceed.\n2. If you need to make additional changes for `Step1`, such as changing ActivityD to ActivityE, you\n   only need to update `maxVersion` from 2 to 3 and branch from there.\n\nYou only need to preserve the first call to `GetVersion()` for each `changeID`. All subsequent calls to\n`GetVersion()` with the same change Id are safe to remove. If necessary, you can remove the first\n`GetVersion()` call, but you need to ensure the following:\n\n- All executions with an older version are completed.\n- You can no longer use `Step1` for the changeId. If you need to make changes to that same part in\n  the future, such as change from ActivityD to ActivityE, you would need to use a different changeId\n  like `Step1-fix2`, and start minVersion from DefaultVersion again. The code would look like the\n  following:\n\n```go\nv := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, \"Step1-fix2\", workflow.DefaultVersion, 1)\nif v == workflow.DefaultVersion {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n} else {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityE, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n}\n```\n\nUpgrading a Workflow is straightforward if you don't need to preserve your currently running Workflow Executions.\nYou can simply terminate all of the currently running Workflow Executions and suspend new ones from being created while you deploy the new version of your Workflow code, which does not use `GetVersion()`, and then resume Workflow creation.\nHowever, that is often not the case, and you need to take care of the currently running Workflow Executions, so using `GetVersion()` to update your code is the method to use.\n\nHowever, if you want your currently running Workflows to proceed based on the current Workflow logic,\nbut you want to ensure new Workflows are running on new logic, you can define your Workflow as a\nnew `WorkflowType`, and change your start path (calls to `StartWorkflow()`) to start the new Workflow\ntype.\n\n## Sanity checking\n\nThe Temporal client SDK performs a sanity check to help prevent obvious incompatible changes.\nThe sanity check verifies whether a Command made in replay matches the event recorded in history,\nin the same order. The Command is generated by calling any of the following methods:\n\n- workflow.ExecuteActivity()\n- workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow()\n- workflow.NewTimer()\n- workflow.RequestCancelWorkflow()\n- workflow.SideEffect()\n- workflow.SignalExternalWorkflow()\n- workflow.Sleep()\n\nAdding, removing, or reordering any of the above methods triggers the sanity check and results in\na non-deterministic error.\n\nThe sanity check does not perform a thorough check. For example, it does not check on the Activity's\ninput arguments or the timer duration. If the check is enforced on every property, then it becomes\ntoo restricted and harder to maintain the Workflow code. For example, if you move your Activity code\nfrom one package to another package, that changes the `ActivityType`, which technically becomes a different\nActivity. But, we don't want to fail on that change, so we only check the function name part of the\n`ActivityType`.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"activities.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/java/activities.md","id":"java/activities","title":"Activities in Java","label":"Activities","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n## What is an Activity?\n\nActivities are implementations of certain tasks that need to be performed during a Workflow Execution.\nThey can be used to interact with external systems, such as databases and services.\n\nWorkflows orchestrate invocations of Activities.\n\nJust like [Workflows](./workflows.md), Activities must be registered with a [Worker](./workers.md).\n\n### Activity interface\n\nSimilar to Workflows, Activities in Temporal Java SDK programming model are classes which implement\nthe ActivityInterface Interface.\n\nActivity Interfaces are Java Interfaces which are annotated with the `@ActivityInterface` annotation:\n\n```java\n@ActivityInterface\npublic interface GreetingActivities {\n    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);\n}\n```\n\nEach method defined in the Activity interface defines a separate Activity method.\nYou can annotate each method in the Activity interface with the `@ActivityMethod`\nannotation, but this is completely optional, for example:\n\n```java\n@ActivityInterface\npublic interface GreetingActivities {\n    @ActivityMethod(name = \"greet\")\n    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the `@ActivityMethod` annotation has a `name` parameter which can be used to define the Activity type.\nIf it is specified like in the example above the type would be \"greet\".\nIf not specified, the Activity method name (with the first letter capitalized) is used by default, so in the example again it would be `composeGreeting`.\n\n### Activity implementation\n\nAn Activity implementation is Java class which implements an Activity Interface, for example:\n\n```java\n  public class MultiLanguageGreeting implements GreetingsActivities {\n    private final TranslationService translationService;\n\n    public MultiLanguageGreeting(TranslationService translationService) {\n      this.translationService = translationService;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language) {\n      return translationService.translate(greeting, language);\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n## Registering Activities with a Worker\n\nJust like Workflows, Activities need to be registered with a Worker, for example:\n\n```java\nWorker worker = factory.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE);\n...\n// register the Activity\nworker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new MultiLanguageGreeting(translationService));\n```\n\nNote that when registering Activities, we register an instance of the Activity implementation, and can pass any\nnumber of dependencies in its constructor, such as the database connections, services, etc.\n\n## Invoking Activities inside Workflows\n\nSimilar to Workflows, Activities should only be instantiated via stubs.\n\n`Workflow.newActivityStub` returns a client-side stub that implements an Activity interface.\nIt takes Activity type and Activity options as arguments.\nActivity options allow you to specify different Activity timeout and retry options.\n\nCalling a method on this interface invokes an Activity that implements this method.\nAn Activity invocation synchronously blocks until the Activity completes, fails, or times out.\nEven if an Activity's execution takes a few months, the Workflow code still sees it as a single synchronous invocation.\nIt doesn't matter what happens to the processes that host the Workflow.\nThe business logic code just sees a single method call.\n\nLet's take a look at an example Workflow that calls Activities:\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingWorkflowImpl implements FileProcessingWorkflow {\n\n    private final FileProcessingActivities activities;\n\n    public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {\n        this.activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(\n                FileProcessingActivities.class,\n                ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n                        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofHours(1))\n                        .build());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void processFile(Arguments args) {\n        String localName = null;\n        String processedName = null;\n        try {\n            localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());\n            processedName = activities.processFile(localName);\n            activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);\n        } finally {\n            if (localName != null) {\n                activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);\n            }\n            if (processedName != null) {\n                activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this example we use `Workflow.newActivityStub` to create a client-side stub of our file processing Activity.\nWe also define ActivityOptions and set the setStartToCloseTimeout timeout to one hour, meaning that we set the total execution timeout for each of its method invocations to one hour (from when the Activity Execution is started to when it completes).\n\nWorkflow can create multiple Activity stubs. Each activity stub can have its own ActivityOptions defined, for example:\n\n```java\npublic FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {\n    ActivityOptions options1 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n             .setTaskQueue(\"taskQueue1\")\n             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(10))\n             .build();\n    this.store1 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options1);\n\n    ActivityOptions options2 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n             .setTaskQueue(\"taskQueue2\")\n             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(5))\n             .build();\n    this.store2 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options2);\n}\n```\n\n### Invoking Activities Asynchronously\n\nSometimes Workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.\nThe Temporal Java SDK provides the `Async` class which includes static methods used to invoke any Activity asynchronously.\nThe calls return a result of type `Promise` which is similar to the Java `Future` and `CompletionStage`.\n\nWhen you need to get the results of an async invoked Activity method, you can use the `Promise` `get` method to block until the Activity method result is available.\n\nTo convert the following synchronous Activity method call:\n\n```java\nString localName = activities.download(sourceBucket, sourceFile);\n```\n\nTo asynchronous style, the method reference is passed to `Async.function` or `Async.procedure`\nfollowed by Activity arguments:\n\n```java\nPromise<String> localNamePromise = Async.function(activities::download, sourceBucket, sourceFile);\n```\n\nThen to wait synchronously for the result you can do the following:\n\n```java\nString localName = localNamePromise.get();\n```\n\nHere is the above example rewritten to call download and upload Activity methods in parallel, on multiple files:\n\n```java\n  public void processFile(Arguments args) {\n    List<Promise<String>> localNamePromises = new ArrayList<>();\n    List<String> processedNames = null;\n    try {\n      // Download all files in parallel.\n      for (String sourceFilename : args.getSourceFilenames()) {\n        Promise<String> localName =\n            Async.function(activities::download, args.getSourceBucketName(), sourceFilename);\n        localNamePromises.add(localName);\n      }\n      List<String> localNames = new ArrayList<>();\n      for (Promise<String> localName : localNamePromises) {\n        localNames.add(localName.get());\n      }\n      processedNames = activities.processFiles(localNames);\n\n      // Upload all results in parallel.\n      List<Promise<Void>> uploadedList = new ArrayList<>();\n      for (String processedName : processedNames) {\n        Promise<Void> uploaded =\n            Async.procedure(\n                activities::upload,\n                args.getTargetBucketName(),\n                args.getTargetFilename(),\n                processedName);\n        uploadedList.add(uploaded);\n      }\n      // Wait for all uploads to complete.\n      Promise.allOf(uploadedList).get();\n    } finally {\n      for (Promise<String> localNamePromise : localNamePromises) {\n        // Skip files that haven't completed downloading.\n        if (localNamePromise.isCompleted()) {\n          activities.deleteLocalFile(localNamePromise.get());\n        }\n      }\n      if (processedNames != null) {\n        for (String processedName : processedNames) {\n          activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n## Invoking Activities via `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub`\n\nIt is also possible to invoke Activities inside Workflows using `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub`, meaning you can\ninvoke them without referencing an interface it implements.\nThis is useful in scenarios where the Activity type is not known at compile time, or to invoke\nActivities implemented in different programming languages.\n\n```java\n   // Workflow code\n    ActivityOptions activityOptions =\n        ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3))\n        .setTaskQueue(\"simple-queue-node\")\n        .build();\n\n    ActivityStub activity = Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub(activityOptions);\n    activity.execute(\"ComposeGreeting\", String.class, \"Hello World\" , \"Spanish\");\n```\n\n## Activity Execution Context\n\n`ActivityExecutionContext` is a context object passed to each Activity implementation by default.\nYou can access it in your Activity implementations via `Activity.getExecutionContext()`.\n\nIt provides getters to access information about the Workflow that invoked the Activity.\nNote that the Activity context information is stored in a thread-local variable.\nTherefore, calls to `getExecutionContext()` succeed only within the thread that invoked the Activity function.\n\nFollowing is an example of using the `ActivityExecutionContext`:\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {\n\n  @Override\n  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {\n\n    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();\n    ActivityInfo info = ctx.getInfo();\n\n    log.info(\"namespace=\" +  info.getActivityNamespace());\n    log.info(\"workflowId=\" + info.getWorkflowId());\n    log.info(\"runId=\" + info.getRunId());\n    log.info(\"activityId=\" + info.getActivityId());\n    log.info(\"activityTimeout=\" + info.getStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds());\n\n    return downloadFileFromS3(bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);\n  }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n## Asynchronous Activity Completion\n\nSometimes an Activity lifecycle goes beyond a synchronous method invocation.\nFor example, a request can be put in a queue and later a reply comes and is picked up by a different Worker process.\nThe whole request-reply interaction can be modeled as a single Activity.\n\nTo indicate that an Activity should not be completed upon its method return, call `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()` from the original Activity thread.\n\nThen later, when replies come, complete the Activity using the `ActivityCompletionClient`.\nTo correlate Activity invocation with completion, use either a `TaskToken` or Workflow and Activity Ids.\n\nFollowing is an example of using `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()`:\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {\n\n  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {\n\n    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();\n\n    // Used to correlate reply\n    byte[] taskToken = ctx.getInfo().getTaskToken();\n    asyncDownloadFileFromS3(taskToken, bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);\n    ctx.doNotCompleteOnReturn();\n\n    // Return value is ignored when doNotCompleteOnReturn was called.\n    return \"ignored\";\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nWhen the download is complete, the download service potentially can complete the Activity, or fail it from a different process, for example:\n\n```java\n  public <R> void completeActivity(byte[] taskToken, R result) {\n    completionClient.complete(taskToken, result);\n  }\n\n  public void failActivity(byte[] taskToken, Exception failure) {\n    completionClient.completeExceptionally(taskToken, failure);\n  }\n```\n\n## Activity heartbeats\n\nActivities can be long-running.\nIn these cases the Activity Execution timeouts should be set to be longer than the maximum predicted time of the Activity Execution.\nIn those cases it can happen that an Activity Execution is started and cannot proceed, or fails to continue its execution for some reasons.\nWith our long set execution timeout the calling Workflow will not be able to time out the Activity and retry it or fail it until this timeout is reached.\n\nIn order to react quickly to crashes of long-running Activities you can use the Activity heartbeat mechanism.\nYou can set a short heartbeat timeout in order to detect Activity issues and react to them without having to wait for the long Activity Execution timeout to complete first.\n\n`Activity.getExecutionContext().heartbeat()` lets the Temporal service know that the Activity is still alive.\n\nThe `Activity.getExecutionContext().heartbeat()` can take an argument which represents heartbeat\n`details`.\nIf an Activity times out, the last heartbeat `details` will be included in the thrown `ActivityTimeoutException` which can be caught by the calling Workflow.\nThe Workflow then can use the `details` information to pass to the next Activity invocation if needed.\n\nIn the case of Activity retries, the last Heartbeat's `details` are available and can be extracted from the last fail attempt using `Activity.getExecutionContext().getHeartbeatDetails(Class<V> detailsClass)`\n\nFollowing is an example of using Activity heartbeat:\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {\n\n  @Override\n  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {\n    InputStream inputStream = openInputStream(file);\n    try {\n      byte[] bytes = new byte[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE];\n      while ((read = inputStream.read(bytes)) != -1) {\n        totalRead += read;\n        f.write(bytes, 0, read);\n        // Let the Server know about the download progress.\n        Activity.getExecutionContext().heartbeat(totalRead);\n      }\n    } finally{\n      inputStream.close();\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n## Throwing Activity errors\n\nIf there is a need to throw checked Exception from Activity methods which do not support re-throwing checked Exceptions in their signatures,\nyou should wrap them using the `Activity.wrap` method and re-throw the Exceptions.\n\nThere is no need to wrap unchecked Exceptions, but it's safe to do so if you want to.\n\nIn addition, when wrapping checked Exceptions, the original Exception is attached as a cause to the wrapped one, and is not lost.\n\nHere is an example of catching a checked Exception and wrapping it:\n\n```java\ntry {\n  return someCall();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n  throw Activity.wrap(e);\n}\n```\n\nNote that any Exception thrown from an Activity is converted to `io.temporal.failure.ApplicationFailure`, unless the thrown Exception extends `io.temporal.failure.TemporalException`

`WorkflowClient`, create a client-side `WorkflowStub`, and then call a Workflow method (annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`).\n\nTo start a Workflow Execution, your Temporal Server must be running, and your front-end service must be accepting gRPC calls.\n\nTo establish a connection with the front-end service, use `WorkflowServiceStubs`.\n\n```java\nWorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();\n```\n\nYou can provide `WorkflowServiceStubsOptions` to override the default values for the gRPC calls.\n\nFor example, the default front-end service gRPC address is set to `127.0.0.1:7233`, where `7233` is the default port for the Temporal Frontend Service.\n\nIf your server is running on a different host or port from the default, you can set it as shown in the following example.\n\n```java\nWorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newInstance(\n                    WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder()\n                     .setTarget(TARGET_ENDPOINT)\n                            .build());\n```\n\nAfter the connection to the Temporal Frontend Service is established, create a Client for the service stub.\nThe Workflow Client helps with client-side APIs and is required by Workers.\n\nCreate an instance of a `WorkflowClient` for the Workflow service stub, and use `WorkflowClientOptions` to set options for the Workflow Client.\nThe following example shows how to create a `WorkflowClient` instance called \"client\" for the `WorkflowServiceStubs` \"service\" that we created in the previous example, and set `Namespace` option for the `WorkflowClient`.\n\n```java\nWorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(\n                service,\n                WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder()\n                        .setNamespace(“Abc”)\n                    .build());\n```\n\nFor more information, see [WorkflowClientOptions](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClientOptions.Builder.html).\n\n`WorkflowService` and `WorkflowClient` creation is a heavyweight operation, and will be resource-intensive if created each time you start a Workflow or send a Signal to it.\nThe recommended way is to create them once and reuse where possible.\n\nWith the Client defined, you can start interacting with the Temporal Frontend Service.\n\nTo initialize a Workflow in the Client, create a `WorkflowStub`, and start the Workflow Execution with `WorkflowClient.start()`.\nStarting Workflows or sending Signals or Queries to Workflows from within a Client must be done using `WorkflowStubs`.\n\n```java\nWorkflowClient workflowClient =  WorkflowClient.newInstance(service, clientOptions);\n // Create a Workflow stub.\n YourWorkflow workflow = workflowClient.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class);\n // Start Workflow asynchronously and call its \"yourWFMethod\" Workflow method\n WorkflowClient.start(workflow::yourWFMethod);\n```\n\nFor more information, see the following:\n\n- [How to spawn a Workflow Execution in

An asynchronous Workflow Execution immediately returns a value to the caller.","label":"Workflow Execution Result","tags":["java","developer-guide"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA synchronous Workflow Execution blocks your client thread until the Workflow Execution completes (or fails) and get the results (or error in case of failure).\n\nThe following example is a type-safe approach for getting the results of a synchronous Workflow Execution.\n\n```java\n FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(\n                FileProcessingWorkflow.class,\n                WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                        .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                        .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                        .build();\n\n// start sync and wait for results (or failure)\nString result = workflow.processfile(new Argument());\n```\n\nAn asynchronous Workflow Execution immediately returns a value to the caller.\n\nThe following examples show how to get the results of a Workflow Execution through typed and untyped `WorkflowStub`.\n\n- **Typed WorkflowStub Example**\n\n  ```java\n  // create typed Workflow stub\n  FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(FileProcessingWorkflow.class,\n                WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                        .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                        .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                        .build());\n  // use WorkflowClient.execute (if your Workflow takes in arguments) or WorkflowClient.start (for zero arguments)\n  WorkflowClient.start(workflow::greetCustomer);\n  ```\n\n- **Untyped WorkflowStub Example**\n\n  ```java\n  WorkflowStub untyped = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(\"FileProcessingWorkflow\",\n                  WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                          .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                          .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                          .build());\n\n  // blocks until Workflow Execution has been started (not until it completes)\n  untyped.start(argument);\n  ```\n\nIf you need to wait for a Workflow Execution to complete after an asynchronous start, the most straightforward way is to call the blocking Workflow instance again.\n\nNote that if `WorkflowOptions.WorkflowIdReusePolicy` is not set to `AllowDuplicate`, then instead of throwing `DuplicateWorkflowException`, it reconnects to an existing Workflow and waits for its completion.\n\nThe following example shows how to do this from a different process than the one that started the Workflow Execution.\n\n```java\nYourWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class, workflowId);\n\n// Returns the result after waiting for the Workflow to complete.\nString result = workflow.yourMethod();\n```\n\nAnother way to connect to an existing Workflow and wait for its completion from another process, is to use `UntypedWorkflowStub`. For example:\n\n```java\nWorkflowStub workflowStub = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(workflowType, workflowOptions);\n\n// Returns the result after waiting for the Workflow to complete.\nString result = untyped.getResult(String.class);\n```\n\n**Get last (successful) completion result**\n\nFor a Temporal Cron Job, get the result of previous successful runs using `GetLastCompletionResult()`.\nThe method returns `null` if there is no previous completion.\nThe following example shows how to implement this in a Workflow.\n\n```java\npublic String cronWorkflow() {\n    String lastProcessedFileName = Workflow.getLastCompletionResult(String.class);\n\n    // Process work starting from the lastProcessedFileName.\n    // Business logic implementation goes here.\n    // Updates lastProcessedFileName to the new value.\n\n    return lastProcessedFileName;\n}\n```\n\nNote that this works even if one of the Cron schedule runs failed.\nThe next schedule will still get the last successful result if it ever successfully completed at least once.\nFor example, for a daily cron Workflow, if the run succeeds on the first day and fails on the second day, then the third day run will get the result from first day's run using these APIs.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-get-the-result-of-an-activity-execution-in-java.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/java/how-to-get-the-result-of-an-activity-execution-in-java.md","id":"java/how-to-get-the-result-of-an-activity-execution-in-java","title":"How

`get` method to block until the Activity method result is available.\n\nSometimes an Activity Execution lifecycle goes beyond a synchronous method invocation.\nFor example, a request can be put in a queue and later a reply comes and is picked up by a different Worker process.\nThe whole request-reply interaction can be modeled as a single Activity.\n\nTo indicate that an Activity should not be completed upon its method return, call `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()` from the original Activity thread.\n\nThen later, when replies come, complete the Activity using the `ActivityCompletionClient`.\nTo correlate Activity invocation with completion, use either a `TaskToken` or Workflow and Activity Ids.\n\nFollowing is an example of using `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()`:\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {\n\n  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {\n\n    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();\n\n    // Used to correlate reply\n    byte[] taskToken = ctx.getInfo().getTaskToken();\n\n    asyncDownloadFileFromS3(taskToken, bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);\n    ctx.doNotCompleteOnReturn();\n\n    // Return value is ignored when doNotCompleteOnReturn was called.\n    return \"ignored\";\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nWhen the download is complete, the download service potentially can complete the Activity, or fail it from a different process, for example:\n\n```java\n  public <R> void completeActivity(byte[] taskToken, R result) {\n    completionClient.complete(taskToken, result);\n  }\n\n  public void failActivity(byte[] taskToken, Exception failure) {\n    completionClient.completeExceptionally(taskToken, failure);\n  }\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-handle-a-query-in-a-workflow-in-java.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/java/how-to-handle-a-query-in-a-workflow-in-java.md","id":"java/how-to-handle-a-query-in-a-workflow-in-java","title":"How

that can be used to filter data that the Query returns.\nBecause the method returns a value, it must have a return type that is not `void`.\n\nThe Query name defaults to the name of the method.\nIn

within a Workflow\n\nUse `ActivityOptions` with `ActivityStub` to set options for invoking Activities within a Workflow.\nThe following example shows how to set `ActivityOptions` for Activities within a Workflow.\n\n```java\nGreetingActivities activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(GreetingActivities.class,\n                ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n

Execution","tags":["java","developer-guide"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nThe first call to the Child Workflow stub must always be its Workflow method (method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`).\nSimilar to Activities, invoking Child Workflow methods can be made synchronous or asynchronous by using `Async#function` or `Async#procedure`.\nThe synchronous call blocks until a Child Workflow method completes.\nThe asynchronous call returns a `Promise` which can be used to wait for the completion of the Child Workflow method, as in the following example:\n\n```java\nGreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);\nPromise<String> greeting = Async.function(child::composeGreeting, \"Hello\", name);\n// ...\ngreeting.get()\n```\n\nTo execute an untyped Child Workflow asynchronously, call `executeAsync` on the `ChildWorkflowStub`, as shown in the following example.\n\n```java\n//...\nChildWorkflowStub childUntyped =\n    Workflow.newUntypedChildWorkflowStub(\n        \"GreetingChild\", // your workflow type\n

greeting.get();\n//...\n```\n\nThe following examples show how to spawn a Child Workflow:\n\n- Spawn a Child Workflow from a Workflow:\n\n  ```java\n  // Child Workflow interface\n  @WorkflowInterface\n  public interface GreetingChild {\n  @WorkflowMethod\n  String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name);\n  }\n  // Child Workflow implementation not shown\n\n  // Parent Workflow implementation\n  public class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {\n\n  @Override\n  public String getGreeting(String name) {\n      GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);\n\n      // This is a blocking call that returns only after child has completed.\n      return child.composeGreeting(\"Hello\", name );\n  }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Spawn two Child Workflows (with the same type) in parallel:\n\n  ```java\n  // Parent Workflow implementation\n  public class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {\n\n      @Override\n      public String getGreeting(String name) {\n\n          // Workflows are stateful, so a new stub must be created for each new child.\n          GreetingChild child1 = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);\n          Promise<String> greeting1 = Async.function(child1::composeGreeting, \"Hello\", name);\n\n          // Both children will run concurrently.\n          GreetingChild child2 = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);\n          Promise<String> greeting2 = Async.function(child2::composeGreeting, \"Bye\", name);\n\n          // Do something else here.\n          ...\n          return \"First: \" + greeting1.get() + \", second: \" + greeting2.get();\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Send a Signal to a Child Workflow from the parent:\n\n  ```java\n  // Child Workflow interface\n  @WorkflowInterface\n  public interface GreetingChild {\n      @WorkflowMethod\n      String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name);\n\n      @SignalMethod\n      void updateName(String name);\n  }\n\n  // Parent Workflow implementation\n  public class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {\n\n      @Override\n      public String getGreeting(String name) {\n          GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);\n          Promise<String> greeting = Async.function(child::composeGreeting, \"Hello\", name);\n          child.updateName(\"Temporal\");\n          return greeting.get();\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Sending a Query to Child Workflows from within the parent Workflow code is not supported. However, you can send a Query to Child Workflows from Activities using `WorkflowClient`.\n\nRelated reads:\n\n- [How to set Child Workflow Options in Java](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/java/how-to-set-child-workflow-options-in-java)\n\n- [How to develop a Workflow Definition](/java/how-to-develop-a-workflow-definition-in-java)\n\n- Java Workflow reference: <https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/workflow/package-summary.html>\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-java.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/java/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-java.md","id":"java/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-java","title":"How to spawn a Workflow Execution in Java","description":"Use `WorkflowStub` to start a Workflow Execution from within a Client, and `ExternalWorkflowStub` to start a different Workflow Execution from within a Workflow.","label":"Workflow Execution","tags":["java","developer-guide"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nUse `WorkflowStub` to start a Workflow Execution from within a Client, and `ExternalWorkflowStub` to start a different Workflow Execution from within a Workflow.\n\nSee [`SignalwithStart`](/java/how-to-send-a-signal-with-start-in-java) to start a Workflow Execution to receive a Signal from within another Workflow.\n\n**Using `WorkflowStub`**\n\n`WorkflowStub` is a proxy generated by the `WorkflowClient`.\nEach time a new Workflow Execution is started, an instance of the Workflow implementation object is created.\nThen, one of the methods (depending on the Workflow Type of the instance) annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can be invoked.\nAs soon as this method returns, the Workflow Execution is considered to be complete.\n\nYou can use a typed or untyped `WorkflowStub` in the client code.\n\n- Typed `WorkflowStub` are useful because they are type safe and allow you to invoke your Workflow methods such as `@WorkflowMethod`, `@QueryMethod`, and `@SignalMethod` directly.\n- An untyped `WorkflowStub` does not use the Workflow interface, and is not type safe. It is more flexible because it has methods from the `WorkflowStub` interface, such as `start`, `signalWithStart`, `getResults` (sync and async), `query`, `signal`, `cancel` and `terminate`.\n  Note that the Temporal Java SDK also provides typed `WorkflowStub` versions for these methods.\n  When using untyped `WorkflowStub`, we rely on the Workflow Type, Activity Type, Child Workflow Type, as well as Query and Signal names.\n  For details, see [Temporal Client](/java/how-to-create-a-temporal-client-in-java).\n\nA Workflow Execution can be started either synchronously or asynchronously.\n\n- Synchronous invocation starts a Workflow and then waits for its completion. If the process that started the Workflow crashes or stops waiting, the Workflow continues executing.\n  Because Workflows are potentially long-running, and Client crashes happen, it is not very commonly found in production use.\n  The following example is a type-safe approach for starting a Workflow Execution synchronously.\n\n  ```java\n    NotifyUserAccounts workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(\n          NotifyUserAccounts.class,\n          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                  .setWorkflowId(\"notifyAccounts\")\n                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                  .build()\n          );\n\n  // start the Workflow and wait for a result.\n    workflow.notify(new String[] { \"Account1\", \"Account2\", \"Account3\", \"Account4\", \"Account5\",\n                  \"Account6\", \"Account7\", \"Account8\", \"Account9\", \"Account10\"});\n      }\n  // notify(String[] accountIds) is a Workflow method defined in the Workflow Definition.\n  ```\n\n- Asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller. This is the most common way to start Workflows in production code.\n  The `WorkflowClient` <https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClient.java)> provides some static methods, such as `start`, `execute`, `signalWithStart` etc., that help with starting your Workflows asynchronously.\n\n  The following examples show how to start Workflow Executions asynchronously, with either typed or untyped `WorkflowStub`.\n\n  - **Typed WorkflowStub Example**\n\n    ```java\n    // create typed Workflow stub\n    FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(FileProcessingWorkflow.class,\n          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                  .build());\n    // use WorkflowClient.execute to return future that contains Workflow result or failure, or\n    // use WorkflowClient.start to return WorkflowId and RunId of the started Workflow).\n    WorkflowClient.start(workflow::greetCustomer);\n    ```\n\n  - **Untyped WorkflowStub Example**\n\n    ```java\n    WorkflowStub untyped = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(\"FileProcessingWorkflow\",\n          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                  .build());\n\n    // blocks until Workflow Execution has been started (not until it completes)\n    untyped.start(argument);\n    ```\n\nYou can call a Dynamic Workflow implementation using an untyped `WorkflowStub`.\nThe following example shows how to call the Dynamic Workflow implementation in the Client code.\n\n```java\n    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);\n    /**\n      * Note that for this part of the client code, the dynamic Workflow implementation must\n      * be known to the Worker at runtime in order to dispatch Workflow tasks, and may be defined\n      * in the Worker definition as:*/\n    // worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(DynamicGreetingWorkflowImpl.class);\n\n    /* Create the Workflow stub to call the dynamic Workflow.\n    * Note that the Workflow Type is not explicitly registered with the Worker.*/\n    WorkflowOptions workflowOptions =\n        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).setWorkflowId(WORKFLOW_ID).build();\n    WorkflowStub workflow = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(\"DynamicWF\", workflowOptions);\n```\n\n`DynamicWorkflow` can be used to invoke different Workflow Types.\nTo check what type is running when your Dynamic Workflow `execute` method runs, use `getWorkflowType()` in the implementation code.\n\n```java\nString type = Workflow.getInfo().getWorkflowType();\n```\n\nSee [Workflow Execution Result](/java/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-java) for details on how to get the results of the Workflow Execution.\n\n**Using `ExternalWorkflowStub`**\n\nUse `ExternalWorkflowStub` within a Workflow to invoke, and send Signals to, other Workflows by type.\n\nThis helps particularly for executing Workflows written in other language SDKs, as shown in the following example.\n\n```java\n@Override\n  public String yourWFMethod(String name) {\n      ExternalWorkflowStub callOtherWorkflow = Workflow.newUntypedExternalWorkflowStub(\"OtherWFId\");\n    }\n```\n\nSee the [Temporal Polyglot](https://github.com/tsurdilo/temporal-polyglot) code for examples of executing Workflows written in other language SDKs.\n\n**Recurring start**\n\nYou can start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule by using [`setCronSchedule`](/java/how-to-set-a-cron-schedule-in-java) Workflow option in the Client code.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-spawn-an-activity-execution-in-java.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/java/how-to-spawn-an-activity-execution-in-java.md","id":"java/how-to-spawn-an-activity-execution-in-java","title":"How to spawn an Activity Execution in Java","description":"Invoke Activities using `Workflow.newActivityStub`(type-safe) or `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub` (untyped) from within a Workflow.","label":"Activity Execution","tags":["java","developer-guide"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nActivities are remote procedure calls that must be invoked from within a Workflow using `ActivityStub`.\nActivities are not executable on their own. You cannot start an Activity Execution by itself.\n\nNote that before an Activity Execution is invoked:\n\n- Activity options (either [`setStartToCloseTimeout`](/concepts/what-is-a-start-to-close-timeout) or [`ScheduleToCloseTimeout`](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule-to-close-timeout) are required) must be set for the Activity.\n  For details, see [Set Activity Options](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/java/how-to-set-activityoptions-in-java) and [Activity Options reference](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/java/reference-activityoptions).\n- The Activity must be registered with a Worker.\n  See [Worker Program](/java/how-to-develop-a-worker-program-in-java)\n- Activity code must be thread-safe.\n\nActivities should only be instantiated using stubs from within a Workflow.\nAn `ActivityStub` returns a client-side stub that implements an Activity interface.\nYou can invoke Activities using `Workflow.newActivityStub`(type-safe) or `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub` (untyped).\n\nCalling a method on the Activity interface schedules the Activity invocation with the Temporal service, and generates an [`ActivityTaskScheduled` Event](/concepts/what-is-an-event#activitytaskscheduled).\n\nActivities can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously.\n\n**Invoking Activities Synchronously**\n\nIn the following example, we use the type-safe `Workflow.newActivityStub` within the \"FileProcessingWorkflow\" Workflow implementation to create a client-side stub of the `FileProcessingActivities` class. We also define `ActivityOptions` and set `setStartToCloseTimeout` option to one hour.\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingWorkflowImpl implements FileProcessingWorkflow {\n\n    private final FileProcessingActivities activities;\n\n    public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {\n        this.activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(\n                FileProcessingActivities.class,\n                ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n                        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofHours(1))\n                        .build());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void processFile(Arguments args) {\n        String localName = null;\n        String processedName = null;\n        try {\n            localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());\n            processedName = activities.processFile(localName);\n            activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);\n        } finally {\n            if (localName != null) {\n                activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);\n            }\n            if (processedName != null) {\n                activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nA Workflow can have multiple Activity stubs. Each Activity stub can have its own `ActivityOptions` defined.\nThe following example shows a Workflow implementation with two typed Activity stubs.\n\n```java\npublic FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {\n    ActivityOptions options1 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n             .setTaskQueue(\"taskQueue1\")\n             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(10))\n             .build();\n    this.store1 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options1);\n\n    ActivityOptions options2 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n             .setTaskQueue(\"taskQueue2\")\n             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(5))\n             .build();\n    this.store2 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options2);\n}\n```\n\nTo invoke Activities inside Workflows without referencing the interface it implements, use an untyped Activity stub `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub`.\nThis is useful when the Activity type is not known at compile time, or to invoke Activities implemented in different programming languages.\n\n```java\n   // Workflow code\n    ActivityOptions activityOptions =\n        ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3))\n        .setTaskQueue(\"simple-queue-node\")\n        .build();\n\n    ActivityStub activity = Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub(activityOptions);\n    activity.execute(\"ComposeGreeting\", String.class, \"Hello World\" , \"Spanish\");\n```\n\n**Invoking Activities Asynchronously**\n\nSometimes Workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.\nThe Temporal Java SDK provides the `Async` class which includes static methods used to invoke any Activity asynchronously.\nThe calls return a result of type `Promise` which is similar to the Java `Future` and `CompletionStage`.\nWhen invoking Activities, use `Async.function` for Activities that return a result, and `Async.procedure` for Activities that return void.\n\nIn the following asynchronous Activity invocation, the method reference is passed to `Async.function` followed by Activity arguments.\n\n```java\nPromise<String> localNamePromise = Async.function(activities::download, sourceBucket, sourceFile);\n```\n\nThe following example shows how to call two Activity methods, \"download\" and \"upload\", in parallel on multiple files.\n\n```java\n  public void processFile(Arguments args) {\n    List<Promise<String>> localNamePromises = new ArrayList<>();\n    List<String> processedNames = null;\n    try {\n      // Download all files in parallel.\n      for (String sourceFilename : args.getSourceFilenames()) {\n        Promise<String> localName =\n            Async.function(activities::download, args.getSourceBucketName(), sourceFilename);\n        localNamePromises.add(localName);\n      }\n      List<String> localNames = new ArrayList<>();\n      for (Promise<String> localName : localNamePromises) {\n        localNames.add(localName.get());\n      }\n      processedNames = activities.processFiles(localNames);\n\n      // Upload all results in parallel.\n      List<Promise<Void>> uploadedList = new ArrayList<>();\n      for (String processedName : processedNames) {\n        Promise<Void> uploaded =\n            Async.procedure(\n                activities::upload,\n                args.getTargetBucketName(),\n                args.getTargetFilename(),\n                processedName);\n        uploadedList.add(uploaded);\n      }\n      // Wait for all uploads to complete.\n      Promise.allOf(uploadedList).get();\n    } finally {\n      for (Promise<String> localNamePromise : localNamePromises) {\n        // Skip files that haven't completed downloading.\n        if (localNamePromise.isCompleted()) {\n          activities.deleteLocalFile(localNamePromise.get());\n        }\n      }\n      if (processedNames != null) {\n        for (String processedName : processedNames) {\n          activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n**Activity Execution Context**\n\n`ActivityExecutionContext` is a context object passed to each Activity implementation by default.\nYou can access it in your Activity implementations via `Activity.getExecutionContext()`.\n\nIt provides getters to access information about the Workflow that invoked the Activity.\nNote that the Activity context information is stored in a thread-local variable.\nTherefore, calls to `getExecutionContext()` succeed only within the thread that invoked the Activity function.\n\nFollowing is an example of using the `ActivityExecutionContext`:\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {\n\n  @Override\n  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {\n\n    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();\n    ActivityInfo info = ctx.getInfo();\n\n    log.info(\"namespace=\" +  info.getActivityNamespace());\n    log.info(\"workflowId=\" + info.getWorkflowId());\n    log.info(\"runId=\" + info.getRunId());\n    log.info(\"activityId=\" + info.getActivityId());\n    log.info(\"activityTimeout=\" + info.getStartToCloseTimeout();\n\n    return downloadFileFromS3(bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);\n  }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nFor details on getting the results of an Activity Execution, see [Activity Execution

Java","label":"Queries","tags":["java"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nWorkflow queries can be used to query a Workflow state by external processes at any time during its execution.\nQuery methods can only be defined inside Workflows Interfaces and are methods annotated with the `@QueryMethod` annotation, for example:\n\n```java\n  @WorkflowInterface\n  public interface HelloWorld {\n    @WorkflowMethod\n    void sayHello(String name);\n\n    @QueryMethod\n    int getCount();\n  }\n```\n\nNotice that the `getCount` method is annotated with `@QueryMethod`.\nThere can be multiple Query methods per Workflow interface.\n\nThe `QueryMethod` annotation has an optional `name` property which can be used to define the query type.\nIf not specified it defaults to the method name.\n\nLet's look at a Workflow implementation and its query method:\n\n```java\n  public static class HelloWorldImpl implements HelloWorld {\n\n    private String greeting = \"Hello\";\n    private int count = 0;\n\n    @Override\n    public void sayHello(String name) {\n      while (!\"Bye\".equals(greeting)) {\n        logger.info(++count + \": \" + greeting + \" \" + name + \"!\");\n        String

@Override\n    public int getCount() {\n      return count;\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThe restrictions on the implementation of the Query method are the following:\n\n- It can not modify Workflow state in any way.\n- It is not allowed to block its thread in any way.\n\nThe Query method usually just returns a value derived from the fields of the Workflow object.\n\nQuery methods can take in any number of input parameters which can be used to limit the data that is returned for

code must be deterministic.\nThis is important so Temporal can replay your Workflow to the point of failure and continue its execution.\n\nWorkflow code that includes arbitrary side effects (for example getting a random number or generating a random UUID, etc), can cause unpredictable results during replay.\n\nBeing able to add some non-deterministic code inside your Workflow is in some cases important, and you can do that using `Workflow.sideEffect`.\n\nThe following sample demonstrates how to use it:\n\n```java\n// implementation of the @WorkflowMethod\npublic void execute() {\n    int randomInt = Workflow.sideEffect( int.class, () -> {\n        Random random = new SecureRandom();\n        return random.nextInt();\n    });\n\n    String userHome = Workflow.sideEffect(String.class,

history, meaning that during a replay it will be returned from the history without executing its code again.\n\nNote that you shouldn't modify the Workflow state inside `Workflow.sideEffect`.\nFor that you should only use the `Workflow.sideEffect` return value.\n\nThe Temporal Java SDK provides deterministic methods to generate a random number, or a random UUID as well:\n\n```java\n//

This allows you to\neasily test long-running Workflows in seconds, without having to change your Workflow code.\n\nYou can use the provided `TestWorkflowEnvironment` with a Java unit testing framework of your choice,\nsuch as JUnit.\n\n## Setup testing dependency\n\nTo start using the Java SDK test framework, you need to add [`io.temporal:temporal-testing`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.temporal/temporal-testing)\nas a dependency to your project:\n\n**[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)**:\n\n```maven\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.temporal</groupId>\n    <artifactId>temporal-testing</artifactId>\n    <version>1.17.0</version>\n    <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n**[Gradle Groovy DSL](https://gradle.org/)**:\n\n```groovy\ntestImplementation (\"io.temporal:temporal-testing:1.17.0\")\n```\n\nMake sure to set the version that matches your dependency version of the [Temporal Java SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java).\n\n## Sample unit tests\n\nThe following code implements unit tests for the `HelloActivity` sample:\n\n```java\npublic class HelloActivityTest {\n\n    private TestWorkflowEnvironment testEnv;\n    private Worker worker;\n    private WorkflowClient client;\n\n    // Set up the test workflow environment\n    @Before\n    public void setUp() {\n        testEnv = TestWorkflowEnvironment.newInstance();\n        worker = testEnv.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE);\n        // Register your workflow implementations\n        worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(GreetingWorkflowImpl.class);\n\n        client = testEnv.getWorkflowClient();\n    }\n\n    // Clean up test environment after tests are completed\n    @After\n    public void tearDown() {\n        testEnv.close();\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testActivityImpl() {\n        // This uses the actual activity impl\n        worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new GreetingActivitiesImpl());\n\n        // Start test environment\n        testEnv.start();\n\n        // Create the workflow stub\n        GreetingWorkflow workflow =\n                client.newWorkflowStub(\n                        GreetingWorkflow.class, WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).build());\n\n        // Execute our workflow waiting for it to complete\n        String greeting = workflow.getGreeting(\"World\");\n        assertEquals(\"Hello World!\", greeting);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn cases where you do not wish to execute your actual Activity implementations during\nunit testing, you can use a framework such as Mockito to mock them.\n\nThe following code implements a unit test for the `HelloActivity` sample which shows\nhow activities can be mocked:\n\n```java\npublic class HelloActivityTest {\n\n    private TestWorkflowEnvironment testEnv;\n    private Worker worker;\n    private WorkflowClient client;\n\n    // Set up the test workflow environment\n    @Before\n    public void setUp() {\n        testEnv = TestWorkflowEnvironment.newInstance();\n        worker = testEnv.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE);\n        // Register your workflow implementations\n        worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(GreetingWorkflowImpl.class);\n\n        client = testEnv.getWorkflowClient();\n    }\n\n    // Clean up test environment after tests are completed\n    @After\n    public void tearDown() {\n        testEnv.close();\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testMockedActivity() {\n        // Mock our workflow

         client.newWorkflowStub(\n                        GreetingWorkflow.class, WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).build());\n\n        // Execute our workflow waiting for it to complete\n        String greeting = workflow.getGreeting(\"World\");\n        assertEquals(\"Hello Mocked World!\", greeting);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing with JUnit4\n\nFor Junit4 tests, Temporal provides the TestWorkflowRule class which simplifies the Temporal test environment setup, as well as the\ncreation and shutdown of Workflow Workers in your tests.\n\nMake sure to set the version that matches your dependency version of the [Temporal Java SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java).\n\nWe can now rewrite our above mentioned \"HelloActivityTest\" test class as follows:\n\n```java\npublic class HelloActivityJUnit4Test {\n    @Rule\n    public TestWorkflowRule testWorkflowRule =\n            TestWorkflowRule.newBuilder()\n

testActivityImpl() {\n        // Get a workflow stub using the same task queue the worker uses.\n        GreetingWorkflow workflow =\n                testWorkflowRule\n                        .getWorkflowClient()\n                        .newWorkflowStub(\n                                GreetingWorkflow.class,\n                                WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(testWorkflowRule.getTaskQueue()).build());\n        // Execute a workflow waiting for it to complete.\n        String greeting = workflow.getGreeting(\"World\");\n        assertEquals(\"Hello World!\", greeting);\n\n        testWorkflowRule.getTestEnvironment().shutdown();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing with JUnit5\n\nFor Junit5 tests, Temporal also provides the TestWorkflowExtension helped class which can be used to simplify the Temporal test environment setup\nas well as Workflow Worker startup and shutdowns.\n\nTo start using JUnit5 TestWorkflowExtension in your tests with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), you need to enable capability [`io.temporal:temporal-testing-junit5`]:\n\nMake sure to set the version that matches your dependency version of the [Temporal Java SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java).\n\nWe can now use JUnit5 and rewrite our above mentioned \"HelloActivityTest\" test class as follows:\n\n```java\npublic class HelloActivityJUnit5Test {\n    @RegisterExtension\n    public static final TestWorkflowExtension testWorkflowExtension =\n            TestWorkflowExtension.newBuilder()\n                    .setWorkflowTypes(GreetingWorkflowImpl.class)\n                    .setActivityImplementations(new GreetingActivitiesImpl())\n                    .build();\n\n    @Test\n    public void testActivityImpl(\n            TestWorkflowEnvironment testEnv, Worker worker, GreetingWorkflow workflow) {\n        // Execute a workflow waiting for it to complete.\n        String greeting = workflow.getGreeting(\"World\");\n        assertEquals(\"Hello World!\", greeting);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can find all unit tests for the [Temporal Java samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java) repository in [its test package](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/test/java/io/temporal/samples).\n\n## Debugging\n\nIn addition to writing unit and integration tests, debugging your Workflows is also a very\nvaluable testing tool. You can debug your Workflow code using a debugger provided\nby your favorite Java IDE.\n\nNote that when debugging your Workflow code, the Temporal Java SDK includes deadlock detection\nwhich fails a Workflow Task in case the code blocks over a second without relinquishing\nexecution control. Because of this you can often encounter the `PotentialDeadlockException`\nException while stepping through Workflow code during debugging.\n\nTo alleviate this issue, you can set the `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` environment variable to true before debugging your\nWorkflow code. Make sure to set `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` to true only during debugging.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"versioning.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/java/versioning.md","id":"java/versioning","title":"Versioning","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAs outlined in the _Workflow Implementation Constraints_ section, Workflow code has to be deterministic by taking the same\ncode path when replaying history events. Any Workflow code change that affects the order in which commands are generated breaks\nthis assumption. The solution that allows updating code of already running Workflows is to keep both the old and new code.\nWhen replaying, use the code version that the events were generated with and when executing a new code path, always take the\nnew code.\n\n## Introduction to Versioning\n\nBecause we design for potentially long-running Workflows at scale, versioning with Temporal works differently than with other workflow systems.\nWe explain more in this optional 30-minute introduction: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY).\n\n## Java Versioning API\n\nUse the `Workflow.getVersion` function to return a version of the code that should be executed and then use the returned\nvalue to pick a correct branch. Let's look at an example.\n\n```java\npublic void processFile(Arguments args) {\n    String localName = null;\n    String processedName = null;\n    try {\n        localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());\n        processedName = activities.processFile(localName);\n        activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);\n    } finally {\n        if (localName != null) { // File was downloaded.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);\n        }\n        if (processedName != null) { // File was processed.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow we decide to calculate the processed file checksum and pass it to upload.\nThe correct way to implement this change is:\n\n```java\npublic void processFile(Arguments args) {\n    String localName = null;\n    String processedName = null;\n    try {\n        localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());\n        processedName = activities.processFile(localName);\n        int version = Workflow.getVersion(\"checksumAdded\", Workflow.DEFAULT_VERSION, 1);\n        if (version == Workflow.DEFAULT_VERSION) {\n            activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);\n        } else {\n            long checksum = activities.calculateChecksum(processedName);\n            activities.uploadWithChecksum(\n                args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName, checksum);\n        }\n    } finally {\n        if (localName != null) { // File was downloaded.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);\n        }\n        if (processedName != null) { // File was processed.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLater, when all Workflows that use the old version are completed, the old branch can be removed.\n\n```java\npublic void processFile(Arguments args) {\n    String localName = null;\n    String processedName = null;\n    try {\n        localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());\n        processedName = activities.processFile(localName);\n        // getVersion call is left here to ensure that any attempt to replay history\n        // for a different version fails. It can be removed later when there is no possibility\n        // of this happening.\n        Workflow.getVersion(\"checksumAdded\", 1, 1);\n        long checksum = activities.calculateChecksum(processedName);\n        activities.uploadWithChecksum(\n            args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName, checksum);\n    } finally {\n        if (localName != null) { // File was downloaded.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);\n        }\n        if (processedName != null) { // File was processed.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe Id that is passed to the `getVersion` call identifies the change. Each change is expected to have its own Id. But if\na change spawns multiple places in the Workflow code and the new code should be either executed in all of them or\nin none of them, then they have to share the Id.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"workers.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/java/workers.md","id":"java/workers","title":"Workers in Java","label":"Workers","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n## What is a Worker?\n\nA Worker is a service that executes [Workflows](/java/workflows) and [Activities](/java/activities).\nWorkers are defined and executed on user controlled hosts.\nYou can use the `WorkerFactory` class to create and run as many Workers as your use case demands, across any number of hosts.\n\nWorkers poll Task Queues for Tasks, execute chunks of code in response to those Tasks, and then communicate the results back to the Temporal Server.\n\nAs a developer, running Workers is a fairly simple procedure,\nbecause the Java SDK handles all the communication between the Worker and the Temporal Server behind the scenes.\n\n## How to start a Worker\n\nTo start a Worker you need to:\n\n1. Create a WorkflowClient instance\n2. Optionally create WorkerOptions\n3. Create a WorkerFactory instance\n4. Create a Worker using the created WorkerFactory's `newWorker` method\n5. Register Workflows and Activities this Worker should execute\n\nAs a simple example, let's say we want our Worker to be able to execute the following Workflow implementation:\n\n```java\npublic static class EmployeeWorkflowImpl implements EmployeeWorkflow {\n\n    private final EmployeeActivities activities =\n        Workflow.newActivityStub(\n                EmployeeActivities.class,\n            ActivityOptions.newBuilder().setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2)).build());\n\n    @Override\n    public Employee getEmployee(String id) {\n      return activities.getEmployeeById(id);\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nOur Workflow invokes `EmployeeActivities` Activities. We can register our Workflow with our Worker:\n\n```java\nWorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();\nWorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);\nWorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);\n\nWorker worker = factory.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE_NAME);\n\nworker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(EmployeeWorkflowImpl.class);\n```\n\nNote that in order to execute our `EmployeeWorkflowImpl` Workflow implementation, there is no need to register any Activities.\nOnly if our created Worker is also used to host the Activity implementations we should register them as well by adding for example:\n\n```java\nString connectionUrl = \"jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=EmployeesDb;user=user;password=pass\";\nworker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new EmployeeActivitiesImpl(connectionUrl));\n```\n\nFor Workflows we register the Workflow Type.\nFor Activities, since they are stateless and thread-safe, we need\nto register an Activity instance.\n\nWhen you start a Workflow or when a Workflow needs to invoke an Activity, the Temporal Server adds\na new task to the Workflows / Activity Task Queue. Any Worker polling that Task Queue and has that Workflow / Activity\nregistered can pick up the new task and execute it.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"workflows.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/java/workflows.md","id":"java/workflows","title":"Workflows in Java","description":"The core abstraction of the Temporal solution is a fault-oblivious stateful Workflow.","label":"Workflows","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nimport RelatedReadList from '../components/RelatedReadList.js'\n\n## What is a Workflow?\n\nWorkflows are resilient programs, meaning that they will continue execution even in the presence of\ndifferent failure conditions.\n\nWorkflows encapsulate execution and orchestration of Tasks, which include Activities and Child Workflows.\nThey also need to react to external events, respond to Query requests, and deal with Timeouts.\n\nIn the Temporal Java SDK programming model, a Workflow is a class that implements a Workflow Interface:\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingWorkflowImpl implements FileProcessingWorkflow {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe Workflow Interface is a Java interface which is annotated with the `@WorkflowInterface` annotation.\n\n## Workflow Interface\n\nWorkflow interface methods must have one of the following annotations:\n\n- **@WorkflowMethod** denotes the starting point of a Workflow Execution.\n  Workflow Execution completes when this method returns.\n- **@SignalMethod** indicates that this method is a Signal handler method and that it can react to external Signals.\n  It can have parameters that can contain the Signal payload.\n  It does not return a value, so it must have a `void` return type.\n- **@QueryMethod** indicates that this method can be used to query the Workflow's state at any time during its execution.\n  It can have parameters that can be used to filter a subset of the Workflow's state that it returns.\n  Because it does return a value, it cannot have a `void` return type.\n\nWorkflow interfaces can define only a single method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`. They can define\nany number of methods annotated with `@SignalMethod` and `@QueryMethod`, for example:\n\n```java\n@WorkflowInterface\npublic interface FileProcessingWorkflow {\n\n    @WorkflowMethod\n    String processFile(Arguments args);\n\n    @QueryMethod(name=\"history\")\n    List<String> getHistory();\n\n    @QueryMethod\n    String getStatus();\n\n    @SignalMethod\n    void retryNow();\n\n    @SignalMethod\n    void abandon();\n}\n```\n\nThe `@WorkflowMethod` annotation has a `name` parameter, for example: `@WorkflowMethod(name = \"YourWorkflowType\")`.\nIt can be used to denote the Workflow Type. If not set, the Workflow Type defaults to the short name of the Workflow interface,\nin the example above being `FileProcessingWorkflow`.\nMethods annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can have any number of parameters.\nWe recommend passing a single parameter that contains all the input fields.\nThis allows adding fields in a backward compatible manner.\n\nThe `@QueryMethod` annotation also has a `name` parameter, for example: `@QueryMethod(name = \"history\")`. It can be\nused to denote the query name. If not set, the query name defaults to the name of the method, in the example above\nbeing `getStatus`.\n\nThe `@SignalMethod` too has a `name` parameter, for example: `@SignalMethod(name = \"mysignal\")`. It can be used to denote the\nsignal type. If not set, the signal type defaults to the name of the method, in the example above being `retryNow` and `abandon`.\n\n### Workflow Interface Inheritance\n\nWorkflow interfaces can form inheritance hierarchies. It may be useful for creating components reusable across multiple\nWorkflow interfaces. For example imaging a UI or CLI button that allows to call `retryNow` signal on any Workflow. To implement\nthis feature you can redesign the above interface to:\n\n```java\npublic interface Retryable {\n    @SignalMethod\n    void retryNow();\n}\n\n@WorkflowInterface\npublic interface FileProcessingWorkflow extends Retryable {\n\n    @WorkflowMethod\n    String processFile(Arguments args);\n\n    @QueryMethod(name=\"history\")\n    List<String> getHistory();\n\n    @QueryMethod\n    String getStatus();\n\n    @SignalMethod\n    void abandon();\n}\n```\n\nThen some other Workflow interface can extend just `Retryable`, for example:\n\n```java\n@WorkflowInterface\npublic interface MediaProcessingWorkflow extends Retryable {\n\n    @WorkflowMethod\n    String processBlob(Arguments args);\n}\n```\n\nNow if we have two running Workflows, one that implements the `FileProcessingWorkflow` interface and another that implements the\n`MediaProcessingWorkflow` interface, we can signal to both using their common interface and knowing their workflowIds, for example:\n\n```java\nRetryable r1 = client.newWorkflowStub(Retryable.class, firstWorkflowId);\nRetryable r2 = client.newWorkflowStub(Retryable.class, secondWorkflowId);\nr1.retryNow();\nr2.retryNow();\n```\n\nThe same technique can be used to query Workflows using a base Workflow interface.\n\nNote that this approach does not apply to `@WorkflowMethod` annotations, meaning that when using a base interface, it should\nnot include any `@WorkflowMethod` methods.\nTo illustrate this, lets' say that we define the following **invalid** code:\n\n```java\n// INVALID CODE!\npublic interface BaseWorkflow {\n    @WorkflowMethod\n    void retryNow();\n}\n\n@WorkflowInterface\npublic interface Workflow1 extends BaseWorkflow {}\n\n@WorkflowInterface\npublic interface Workflow2 extends BaseWorkflow {}\n```\n\nIf we attempt to register implementations of Workflow1 and Workflow2 with a Worker will fail. Let's say that we have:\n\n```java\nworker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(\n        Workflow1Impl.class, Workflow2Impl.class);\n```\n\nThis registration will fail with:\n\n```text\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: BaseWorkflow workflow type is already registered with the worker\n```\n\n## Implementing Workflows\n\nA Workflow implementation implements a Workflow interface. Each time a new Workflow Execution is started,\na new instance of the Workflow implementation object is created.\nThen, one of the methods\n(depending on which Workflow Type has been started) annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can be invoked.\nAs soon as this method returns, the Workflow Execution is considered as completed.\n\nWorkflow methods annotated with `@QueryMethod` and `@SignalMethod` can be invoked during a Workflow's execution.\n\nNote that methods annotated with `@QueryMethod` can be invoked even when a Workflow is in the `Completed`\nstate.\n\n### Workflow Implementation Constraints\n\nTemporal uses the [Event Sourcing pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) to recover\nthe state of a Workflow object including its threads and local variable values.\nIn essence, every time a Workflow state has to be restored, its code is re-executed from the beginning.\nNote that during replay, successfully executed Activities are not re-executed as their results are already recorded\nin the Workflow event history.\n\nEven though Temporal has the replay capability, which brings resilience to your Workflows, you should never think about\nthis capability when writing your Workflows.\nInstead, you should focus on implementing your business logic/requirements and write your Workflows\nas they would execute only once.\n\nThere are some things however to think about when writing your Workflows, namely determinism and isolation.\nWe summarize these constraints here:\n\nThey shouldn't use any constructs that rely on system time.\n\n- Do not use any mutable global variables in your Workflow implementations. This will assure that multiple Workflow instances are fully isolated.\n- Do not call any non-deterministic functions like non seeded random or UUID.randomUUID() directly from the Workflow code. The Temporal SDK provides specific API for calling non-deterministic code in your Workflows, which we will show later on in this document.\n- Perform all IO operations and calls to third-party services on Activities and not Workflows, as they are usually non-deterministic in nature.\n- Do not use any programming language constructs that rely on system time. For example, only use `Workflow.currentTimeMillis()` to get the current time inside a Workflow.\n- Do not use native Java `Thread` or any other multi-threaded classes like `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Use `Async.function` or `Async.procedure`,\n  provided by the Temporal SDK, to execute code asynchronously.\n- Don't use any synchronization, locks, and other standard Java blocking concurrency-related classes besides those provided\n  by the Workflow class. There is no need in explicit synchronization because multi-threaded code inside a Workflow is\n  executed one thread at a time and under a global lock.\n  - Call `Workflow.sleep` instead of `Thread.sleep`.\n  - Use `Promise` and `CompletablePromise` instead of `Future` and `CompletableFuture`.\n  - Use `WorkflowQueue` instead of `BlockingQueue`.\n- Use `Workflow.getVersion` when making any changes to the Workflow code. Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code\n  might break already running Workflows.\n- Don’t access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow Execution path.\n  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.\n\n### Workflow Method Arguments\n\n- [What is a Data Converter?](/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter)\n\nJava DataConverter reference: https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html\n\n## Workflow Activities\n\nTo learn about Workflow Activities visit [this page](/java/activities).\n\n## Child Workflows\n\nBesides Activities, a Workflow can also start other Workflows.\n\n<RelatedReadList\nreadlist={[\n[\"What is a Child Workflow Execution?\",\"/concepts/what-is-a-child-workflow-execution\",\"explanation\"],\\\n]}\n/>\n\n### Java Child Workflow API\n\n`Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub` returns a client-side stub that implements a Child Workflow interface.\nIt takes a Child Workflow Type and optional Child Workflow options as arguments.\nWorkflow options can be used to set Timeouts, retry options, and Task Queue settings, for example.\nBy default, a Child Workflow inherits the Workflow options of its parent.\nYou can, however, overwrite these default options by passing in custom Workflow options when creating the Child Workflow stub.\n\nThe first call to the Child Workflow stub must always be its Workflow method (the method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`).\n\nSimilar to Activities, invoking child Workflow methods can be made synchronous or asynchronous by using `Async#function` or `Async#procedure`.\nThe synchronous call blocks until a child Workflow method completes. The asynchronous call\nreturns a `Promise` that can be used to wait for the completion of the child Workflow method, for example:\n\n```java\nGreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);\nPromise<String> greeting = Async.function(child::composeGreeting, \"Hello\", name);\n// ...\ngreeting.get()\n```\n\nNote that querying child Workflows from within the parent Workflow code is not supported. You can however\nquery child Workflows from Activities using `WorkflowClient`.\n\nFollowing are examples of using a child Workflow inside a Workflow:\n\n```java\n// Child Workflow interface\n@WorkflowInterface\npublic interface GreetingChild {\n   @WorkflowMethod\n   String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name);\n}\n// Child Workflow implementation not shown\n\n// Parent Workflow implementation\npublic class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {\n\n   @Override\n   public String getGreeting(String name) {\n       GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);\n\n       // This is a blocking call that returns only after child has completed.\n       return child.composeGreeting(\"Hello\", name );\n   }\n}\n```\n\nRunning two children (with the same type) in parallel:\n\n```java\n// Parent Workflow implementation\npublic class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {\n\n    @Override\n    public String getGreeting(String name) {\n\n        // Workflows are stateful, so a new stub must be created for each new child.\n        GreetingChild child1 = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);\n        Promise<String> greeting1 = Async.function(child1::composeGreeting, \"Hello\", name);\n\n        // Both children will run concurrently.\n        GreetingChild child2 = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);\n        Promise<String> greeting2 = Async.function(child2::composeGreeting, \"Bye\", name);\n\n        // Do something else here.\n        ...\n        return \"First: \" + greeting1.get() + \", second: \" + greeting2.get();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSending a signal to a child Workflow from the parent:\n\n```java\n// Child Workflow interface\n@WorkflowInterface\npublic interface GreetingChild {\n    @WorkflowMethod\n    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name);\n\n    @SignalMethod\n    void updateName(String name);\n}\n\n// Parent Workflow implementation\npublic class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {\n\n    @Override\n    public String getGreeting(String name) {\n        GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);\n        Promise<String> greeting = Async.function(child::composeGreeting, \"Hello\", name);\n        child.updateName(\"Temporal\");\n        return greeting.get();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### ParentClosePolicy\n\nWhen creating a Child Workflow, you can define a `ParentClosePolicy` that terminates, cancels, or abandons the Workflow Execution if the child's parent stops execution.\n\n- `ABANDON`: When the parent stops, don't do anything with the Child Workflow.\n- `TERMINATE`: When the parent stops, terminate the Child Workflow\n- `REQUEST_CANCEL`: When the parent stops, terminate the Child Workflow\n\nYou can set policies per child, which means you can opt out of propagating terminates / cancels on a per-child basis.\nThis is useful for starting Child Workflows asynchronously:\n\n```java\n public void parentWorkflow() {\n     ChildWorkflowOptions options =\n        ChildWorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n            .setParentClosePolicy(ParentClosePolicy.PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_ABANDON)\n            .build();\n     MyChildWorkflow child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(MyChildWorkflow.class, options);\n     Async.procedure(child::<workflowMethod>, <args>...);\n     Promise<WorkflowExecution> childExecution = Workflow.getWorkflowExecution(child);\n     // Wait for child to start\n     childExecution.get()\n}\n```\n\n1. Set `ChildWorkflowOptions.ParentClosePolicy` to `ABANDON` when creating a Child Workflow stub.\n2. Start Child Workflow Execution asynchronously using `Async.function` or `Async.procedure`.\n3. Call `Workflow.getWorkflowExecution(…)` on the child stub\n4. Wait for the Promise returned by `getWorkflowExecution` to complete.\n   This indicates that the child successfully started (or start failed).\n5. Complete Parent Workflow Execution asynchronously\n\nSteps 3 and 4 are needed to ensure that a Child Workflow Execution starts before the parent closes.\nIf the parent initiates a Child Workflow Execution and then immediately completes, the child would never execute.\n\n## Starting Workflow Executions\n\nIn the Temporal Java SDK, Workflows can be started both synchronously and asynchronously.\nTo do either, you must initialize an instance of a `WorkflowClient`, create a client side Workflow stub,\nand then call a Workflow method (annotated with the `@WorkflowMethod` annotation).\n\n### Asynchronous start\n\nAn asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller.\nThis is the most common way to start Workflows in a live environment.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART money-transfer-project-template-java-workflow-initiator-->\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nIf you need to wait for the completion of a Workflow after an asynchronous start, the most straightforward way is to call the blocking Workflow instance again.\n\nIf `WorkflowOptions.WorkflowIdReusePolicy` is not set to `AllowDuplicate`, then instead of throwing `DuplicateWorkflowException`,\nit reconnects to an existing Workflow and waits for its completion.\n\nThe following example shows how to do this from a different process than the one that started the Workflow Execution.\n\n```java\nYourWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class, workflowId);\n\n// Returns the result after waiting for the Workflow to complete.\nString result = workflow.yourMethod();\n```\n\nAnother way to connect to an existing Workflow and wait for its completion from another process is to use `UntypedWorkflowStub`.\nFor example:\n\n```java\nWorkflowStub workflowStub = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(workflowType, workflowOptions);\n\n// Returns the result after waiting for the Workflow to complete.\nString result = workflowStub.getResult(String.class);\n```\n\n### Synchronous start\n\nA Synchronous start initiates a Workflow and then waits for its completion. The started Workflow will not rely on the invocation process and will continue executing even if the waiting process crashes or was stopped.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART hello-world-project-template-java-workflow-initiator-->\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n### Recurring start\n\nYou can start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule with [the CronSchedule option](distributed-cron).\n\n### External Workflows\n\nWorkflows can execute (and signal to) other workflows purely by name.\nThis helps particularly for executing workflows from other language SDKs.\nSee our [Temporal Polyglot example](https://github.com/tsurdilo/temporal-polyglot) for more.\n\n## Large Event Histories\n\nTemporal SDK allows you to manually use [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new) in a number of ways:\n\nIf you are continuing execution of the same Workflow that is currently running, you can do the following:\n\n```java\nWorkflow.continueAsNew(input1, ...);\n```\n\nIt is also possible to continue execution as a completely different Workflow Type.\nIn a Workflow class called `YourWorkflow` for example, we can create a Workflow Stub with a different type and\ncall its Workflow method to continue execution as that type:\n\n```java\nMyOtherWorkflow continueAsNew = Workflow.newContinueAsNewStub(MyOtherWorkflow.class);\ncontinueAsNew.greet(input);\n```\n\n`Workflow.newContinueAsNewStub` also allows to provide `ContinueAsNewOptions` options, for example:\n\n```java\nContinueAsNewOptions options = ContinueAsNewOptions.newBuilder()\n        .setTaskQueue(\"newTaskQueueName\")\n        .build();\n\nMyOtherWorkflow continueAsNew = Workflow.newContinueAsNewStub(MyOtherWorkflow.class, options);\n// ...\ncontinueAsNew.greet(input);\n```\n\nThis allows you to continue Workflow Execution as a new Workflow run with a different Workflow Type and on a different Task Queue.\n\nAnother way to deal with the Event History size limits is to use Child Workflows; however,\nthey themselves could eventually, if long running, experience the same issue in which case you can again\napply the \"ContinueAsNew\" feature if needed.\n\n\"ContinueAsNew\" can also be used in [child Workflows](#child-workflows). Note that in this case the parent Workflow\nis not aware if its child Workflows called \"ContinueAsNew\". This way a child Workflow can call \"ContinueAsNew\" as many times\nas it needs, and the parent Workflow will get notified when the last run of the child Workflow completes or fails.\n\nIf you need to know whether a Workflow was started via `continueAsNew`, you can check `Workflow.getInfo().getContinuedExecutionRunId().isPresent()`.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"cluster-plugins.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/security/cluster-plugins.md","id":"security/cluster-plugins","title":"Temporal Cluster plugins conceptual context","description":"Temporal Clusters support some pluggable components.","label":"Plugins","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTemporal Clusters support some pluggable components.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-authorize-sdk-api-calls.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/security/how-to-authorize-sdk-api-calls.md","id":"security/how-to-authorize-sdk-api-calls","title":"How to authorize SDK API calls","description":"When authentication is enabled, you can authorize API calls made to the Frontend Service.","label":"Authorize API calls","tags":["security","guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nWhen authentication is enabled, you can authorize API calls made to the Frontend Service.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-set-up-codec-server.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/security/how-to-set-up-codec-server.md","id":"security/how-to-set-up-codec-server","title":"How to set up a Codec Server","description":"Run a Codec Server with your Payload Codec and then configure tctl and the Web UI to use the server.","label":"Codec Server","tags":["security","how-to"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTo use a [Codec Server](/concepts/what-is-a-codec-server), first run it with your Payload Codec and then configure [tctl](/tctl-v1) and the [Web UI](/web-ui) to use it.\n\n### Run the server\n\nA Codec Server is an HTTP server that follows the Temporal [Codec Server Protocol](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server#codec-server-protocol).\nIt implements two endpoints:\n\n- `POST /encode`\n- `POST /decode`\n\nEach endpoint receives and responds with a JSON body that has a `payloads` property with an array of Payloads.\nThe endpoints run the Payloads through a [Payload Codec](/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter#payload-codec) before returning them.\n\nSample Codec Servers:\n\n- [Go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server)\n- [Python](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/blob/main/encryption/codec_server.py)\n- [TypeScript](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/encryption/src/codec-server.ts)\n\n### Configure tctl\n\nOnce the Codec Server is started, for example on `http://localhost:8888`, provide it to tctl using the `--codec_endpoint` global option:\n\n```bash\ntctl --codec_endpoint 'http://localhost:8888' workflow show --wid workflow-id-123\n```\n\n### Configure the Web UI\n\nOnce the Codec Server is started, there are two ways to provide it to the Web UI:\n\n#### In the UI\n\n![Data Encoder icon](/img/docs/data-encoder-button.png)\n\nSelect the icon with an up-down arrow on the bottom left of the screen.\nThis action displays the codec endpoint dialog.\n\nEnter the URL and port number for your codec endpoint.\nExit the dialog, go back to the previous page, and refresh the page.\n\nThe button should now be light blue, and your Payloads should be displayed in a readable format.\n\n#### In the config file\n\nThe codec endpoint can be specified in the [configuration file](/references/web-ui-configuration#codec):\n\n```yaml\ncodec:\n    endpoint: {{ default .Env.TEMPORAL_CODEC_ENDPOINT \"{namespace}\"}}\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"intro.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/security/intro.md","id":"security/intro","title":"Temporal Platform security overview","description":"The security guide provides a comprehensive overview of the security related features and how to implement them.","tags":["security","guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n:::info Work in progress\n\nThis guide is a work in progress.

page](/temporal-technologies-inc-security).\n\n:::\n\nThe Temporal Plaform is designed with security in mind, and there are many features that you can use to keep both the Platform itself and your user's data secure.\n\nA secured Temporal Server has its network communication encrypted and has authentication and authorization protocols set up for API calls made to it.\nWithout these, your server could be accessed by unwanted entities.\n\nWhat is documented on this page are the built-in opt-in security measures that come with Temporal.\nHowever users may also choose to design their own security architecture with reverse proxies or run unsecured instances inside of a VPC environment.\n\n### Server Samples\n\nThe https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server repo offers two examples, which are further explained below:\n\n- **TLS**: how to configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure network communication with and within a Temporal cluster.\n- **Authorizer**: how to inject a low-level authorizer component that can control access to all API calls.\n\n### Encryption in transit with mTLS\n\nTemporal supports Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) as a way of encrypting network traffic between the services of a cluster and also between application processes and a Cluster.\nSelf-signed or properly minted certificates can be used for mTLS.\nmTLS is set in Temporal's [TLS configuration](/references/configuration/#tls).\nThe configuration includes two sections such that intra-Cluster and external traffic can be encrypted with different sets of certificates and settings:\n\n- `internode`: Configuration for encrypting communication between nodes in the cluster.\n- `frontend`: Configuration for encrypting the Frontend's public endpoints.\n\nA customized configuration can be passed using either the [WithConfig](/references/server-options#withconfig) or [WithConfigLoader](/references/server-options#withconfigloader) Server options.\n\nSee [TLS configuration reference](/references/configuration/#tls) for more details.\n\n### Authentication\n\nThere are a few authentication protocols available to prevent unwanted access such as authentication of servers, clients, and users.\n\n### Servers\n\nTo prevent spoofing and [MITM attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) you can specify the `serverName` in the `client` section of your respective mTLS configuration.\nThis enables established connections to authenticate the endpoint, ensuring that the server certificate presented to any connecting Client has the appropriate server name in its CN property.\nIt can be used for both `internode` and `frontend` endpoints.\n\nMore guidance on mTLS setup can be found in [the `samples-server` repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/main/tls) and you can reach out to us for further guidance.\n\n### Client connections\n\nTo restrict a client's network access to cluster endpoints you can limit it to clients with certificates issued by a specific Certificate Authority (CA).\nUse the `clientCAFiles`/ `clientCAData` and `requireClientAuth` properties in both the `internode` and `frontend` sections of the [mTLS configuration](/references/configuration/#tls).\n\n### Users\n\nTo restrict access to specific users, authentication and authorization is performed through extensibility points and plugins as described in the [Authorization](#authorization) section below.\n\n#### Authorization\n\n:::note\nInformation regarding [`Authorizer`](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin) and [`ClaimMapper`](/concepts/what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin) has been moved to another location.\n:::\n\nTemporal offers two plugin interfaces for implementing API call authorization:\n\n- [`ClaimMapper`](/concepts/what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin)\n- [`Authorizer`](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin)\n\nThe authorization and claim mapping logic is customizable, making it available to a variety of use cases and identity schemes.\nWhen these are provided the frontend invokes the implementation of these interfaces before executing the requested operation.\n\nSee https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/blob/main/extensibility/authorizer for a sample implementation.\n\n![](/img/docs/frontend-authorization-order-of-operations.png)\n\n### Single sign-on integration\n\nTemporal can be integrated with a single sign-on (SSO) experience by utilizing the `ClaimMapper` and `Authorizer` plugins.\nThe default JWT `ClaimMapper` implementation can be used as is or as a base for a custom implementation of a similar plugin.\n\n#### Temporal Web\n\nTo enable SSO for the Temporal Web UI edit the web service's configuration per the [Temporal Web

When using asynchronous Activities there aren't any additional Worker parameters needed.\n\nCancellation for asynchronous activities is done by means of the\n[`asyncio.Task.cancel`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task.cancel) operation. This means that `asyncio.CancelledError` will be raised (and can be caught, but it is not recommended).\n\nAn Activity must Heartbeat to receive cancellation.\n\n##### [Synchronous Activities](#synchronous-activities)\n\nThe [`activity_executor`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.WorkerConfig.html#activity_executor) Worker parameter must be set with a [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor) instance to use for executing the Activities.\n\nCancellation for synchronous Activities is done in the background and the Activity must choose to listen for it and react appropriately.\n\nAn Activity must Heartbeat to receive cancellation.\n\n- ###### [Synchronous Multithreaded Activities](#synchronous-multithreaded-activities)\n\nMultithreaded Activities are functions that use `activity_executor` set to an instance of [`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor).\n\nBesides `activity_executor`, no other additional Worker parameters are required for synchronous multithreaded Activities.\n\n- ###### [Synchronous Multiprocess/Other Activities](#synchronous-multiprocess)\n\nIf `activity_executor` is set to an instance of [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor) that is not `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, then the synchronous activities are considered multiprocess/other activities.\n\nThese require special primitives for heartbeating and cancellation. The `shared_state_manager` Worker parameter must be set to an instance of [`worker.SharedStateManager`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.SharedStateManager.html).

implementation can be easily configured.\n\nFollowing is an example of an interface that defines four Activities:\n\n```php\n#[ActivityInterface]\ninterface FileProcessingActivities\n{\n    public function upload(string $bucketName, string $localName, string $targetName): void;\n\n    #[ActivityMethod(\"transcode_file\")]\n    public function download(string $bucketName, string $remoteName): void;\n\n    public function processFile(): string;\n\n    public function deleteLocalFile(string $fileName): void;\n}\n```\n\nWe recommend to use a single value type argument for Activity methods.\nIn this way, adding new arguments as fields to the value type is a backwards-compatible change.\n\nAn optional `#[ActivityMethod]` annotation can be used to override a default Activity name.\n\nOption `prefix` of `ActivityInterface` annotation will allow you to define your own prefix for all activity names (by\ndefault it's empty).\n\n```php\n#[ActivityInterface(\"file_activities.\")]\ninterface FileProcessingActivities\n{\n    public function upload(string $bucketName, string $localName, string $targetName);\n\n    #[ActivityMethod(\"transcode_file\")]\n    public function download(string $bucketName, string $remoteName);\n\n    public function processFile(): string;\n\n    public function deleteLocalFile(string $fileName);\n}\n```\n\n## Implementing Activities\n\nActivity implementation is an implementation of an Activity interface.\nA single instance of the Activities implementation is shared across multiple simultaneous Activity invocations.\nTherefore, the Activity implementation code must be _stateless_.\n\nThe values passed to Activities through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the execution history.\nThe entire execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow workers when a Workflow state needs to recover.\nA large execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.\nTherefore, be mindful of the amount of data you transfer via Activity invocation parameters or return values.\n\nOtherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.\n\n```php\nclass FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {\n\n    private S3Client $s3Client;\n\n    private string $localDirectory;\n\n    public function __construct(S3Client $s3Client, string $localDirectory) {\n        $this->s3Client = $s3Client;\n        $this->localDirectory = $localDirectory;\n    }\n\n    public function upload(string $bucketName, string $localName, string $targetName): void\n    {\n        $this->s3Client->putObject(\n            $bucketName,\n            $targetName,\n            fopen($this->localDirectory . $localName, 'rb+')\n        );\n    }\n\n    public function download(\n        string $bucketName,\n        string $remoteName,\n        string $localName\n    ): void\n    {\n        $this->s3Client->downloadObject(\n            $bucketName,\n            $remoteName,\n            fopen($this->localDirectory .$localName, 'wb+')\n        );\n    }\n\n    public function processFile(string $localName): string\n    {\n        // Implementation omitted for brevity.\n        return compressFile($this->localDirectory . $localName);\n    }\n\n    public function deleteLocalFile(string $fileName): void\n    {\n        unlink($this->localDirectory . $fileName);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Accessing Activity Info\n\nThe [Activity](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/blob/master/src/Activity.php) class provides static getters to access information about the Workflow that invoked it.\nNote that this information is stored in a thread local variable.\nTherefore, calls to Activity accessors succeed only in the process that invoked the Activity function.\n\n```php\nuse Temporal\\Activity;\n\nclass FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities\n{\n    // ...\n\n    public function download(\n        string $bucketName,\n        string $remoteName,\n        string $localName\n    ): void\n    {\n        $this->logger->info(\"namespace=\" +  Activity.getNamespace());\n\n        $info = Activity::getInfo();\n\n        $this->logger->info(\"workflowId=\" + $info->workflowExecution->getID());\n        $this->logger->info(\"runId=\" + $info->workflowExecution->getRunID());\n        $this->logger->info(\"activityId=\" + $info->id);\n        $this->logger->info(\"activityDeadline=\" + $info->deadline);\n\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Activity Heart Beating\n\nSome Activities are long-running.\nTo react to a crash quickly, use the Heartbeat mechanism, `Activity::heartbeat()`, which lets the Temporal Server know that the Activity is still alive.\nThis acts as a periodic checkpoint mechanism for the progress of an Activity.\n\nYou can piggyback `details` on an Activity Heartbeat.\nIf an Activity times out, the last value of `details` is included in the `TimeoutFailure` delivered to a Workflow.\nThen the Workflow can pass the details to the next Activity invocation.\nAdditionally, you can access the details from within an Activity via `Activity::getHeartbeatDetails`.\nWhen an Activity is retried after a failure `getHeartbeatDetails` enables you to get the value from the last successful Heartbeat.\n\n```php\nuse Temporal\\Activity;\n\nclass FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities\n{\n    // ...\n    public function download(\n        string $bucketName,\n        string $remoteName,\n        string $localName\n    ): void\n    {\n        $this->dowloader->downloadWithProgress(\n            $bucketName,\n            $remoteName,\n            $localName,\n            // on progress\n            function ($progress) {\n                Activity::heartbeat($progress);\n            }\n        );\n\n        Activity::heartbeat(100); // download complete\n\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Calling Activities\n\n`Workflow::newActivityStub` returns a client-side stub an implements an Activity interface.\nThe client-side stub can be used within the Workflow code.\nIt takes the Activity's type and `ActivityOptions` as arguments.\n\nCalling (via `yield`) a method on this interface invokes an Activity that implements this method.\nAn Activity invocation synchronously blocks until the Activity completes, fails, or times out.\nEven if Activity Execution takes a few months, the Workflow code still sees it as a single synchronous invocation.\nIt doesn't matter what happens to the processes that host the Workflow.\nThe business logic code just sees a single method call.\n\n```php\nclass GreetingWorkflow implements GreetingWorkflowInterface\n{\n    private $greetingActivity;\n\n    public function __construct()\n    {\n        $this->greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(\n            GreetingActivityInterface::class,\n            ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 seconds'))\n        );\n    }\n\n    public function greet(string $name): \\Generator\n    {\n        // This is a blocking call that returns only after the activity has completed.\n        return yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hello', $name);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf different Activities need different options, like timeouts or a task queue, multiple client-side stubs can be created with different options.\n\n```php\n$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(\n    GreetingActivityInterface::class,\n    ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 seconds'))\n);\n\n$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(\n    GreetingActivityInterface::class,\n    ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 minutes'))\n);\n```\n\n## Calling Activities Asynchronously\n\nSometimes Workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.\n\nInvoking activity stub without the use of `yield` will return the activity result promise which can be resolved at later moment.\nCalling `yield` on promise blocks until a result is available.\n\n> Activity promise also exposes `then` method to construct promise chains.\n> Read more about Promises [here](https://github.com/reactphp/promise).\n\nAlternatively, you can explicitly wrap your code (including `yield` constucts) using `Workflow::async`, which executes nested code in parallel with main Workflow code.\nCall `yield` on the Promise returned by `Workflow::async` to merge the execution result back to the primary Workflow method.\n\n```php\npublic function greet(string $name): \\Generator\n{\n    // Workflow::async runs it's activities and child workflows in a separate coroutine. Use keyword yield to merge\n    // it back to parent process.\n\n    $first = Workflow::async(\n        function () use ($name) {\n            $hello = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hello', $name);\n            $bye = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Bye', $name);\n\n            return $hello . '; ' . $bye;\n        }\n    );\n\n    $second = Workflow::async(\n        function () use ($name) {\n            $hello = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hola', $name);\n            $bye = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Chao', $name);\n\n            return $hello . '; ' . $bye;\n        }\n    );\n\n    // blocks until $first and $second complete\n    return (yield $first) . \"\\n\" . (yield $second);\n}\n```\n\n## Async completion\n\nThere are certain scenarios when moving on from an Activity upon completion of its function is not possible or desirable.\nFor example, you might have an application that requires user input to complete the Activity.\nYou could implement the Activity with a polling mechanism, but a simpler and less resource-intensive implementation is to asynchronously complete a Temporal Activity.\n\nThere are two parts to implementing an asynchronously completed Activity:\n\n1. The Activity provides the information necessary for completion from an external system and notifies the Temporal service that it is waiting for that outside callback.\n2. The external service calls the Temporal service to complete the Activity.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the first part:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART samples-php-async-activity-completion-activity-class-->\n\n[app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/GreetingActivity.php](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/blob/master/app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/GreetingActivity.php)\n\n```php\nclass GreetingActivity implements GreetingActivityInterface\n{\n    private LoggerInterface $logger;\n\n    public function __construct()\n    {\n        $this->logger = new Logger();\n    }\n    /**\n     * Demonstrates how to implement an Activity asynchronously.\n     * When {@link Activity::doNotCompleteOnReturn()} is called,\n     * the Activity implementation function that returns doesn't complete the Activity.\n     */\n    public function composeGreeting(string $greeting, string $name): string\n    {\n        // In real life this request can be executed anywhere. By a separate service for example.\n        $this->logger->info(sprintf('GreetingActivity token: %s', base64_encode(Activity::getInfo()->taskToken)));\n        // Send the taskToken to the external service that will complete the Activity.\n        // Return from the Activity a function indicating that Temporal should wait\n        // for an async completion message.\n        Activity::doNotCompleteOnReturn();\n        // When doNotCompleteOnReturn() is invoked the return value is ignored.\n        return 'ignored';\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nThe following code demonstrates how to complete the Activity successfully using `WorkflowClient`:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART samples-php-async-activity-completion-completebytoken-->\n\n[app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/CompleteCommand.php](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/blob/master/app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/CompleteCommand.php)\n\n```php\n$client = $this->workflowClient->newActivityCompletionClient();\n// Complete the Activity.\n$client->completeByToken(\n    base64_decode($input->getArgument('token')),\n    $input->getArgument('message')\n);\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nTo fail the Activity, you would do the following:\n\n```php\n// Fail the Activity.\n$activityClient->completeExceptionallyByToken($taskToken, new \\Error(\"activity failed\"));\n```\n\n## Local Activity\n\nTo create a Local Activity you should use `#[LocalActivityInterface]` (instead of `#[ActivityInterface]`):\n\n```php\nuse Temporal\\Activity\\LocalActivityInterface;\n\n#[LocalActivityInterface]\ninterface GreetingActivityInterface\n{\n    #[ActivityMethod(\"greet\")]\n    public function greet(): string;\n}\n```\n\nLocal Activity requires `LocalActivityOptions`:\n\n```php\n$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(\n    GreetingActivityInterface::class,\n    LocalActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 seconds'))\n);\n```\n\nLocal Activities have a limited set of options, including: `ScheduleToCloseTimeout`, `StartToCloseTimeout`, `RetryPolicy`.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"code-samples-php.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/code-samples-php.md","id":"php/code-samples-php","title":"Code samples","label":"Code samples","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n- [PHP samples repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php)\n\n- [Subscription-style Workflow Definition in PHP](https://github.com/temporalio/subscription-workflow-project-template-php): Demonstrates some of the patterns that could be implemented for a subscription-style business process.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"distributed-cron.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/distributed-cron.md","id":"php/distributed-cron","title":"Distributed CRON","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n:::info Try the Developer's guide\n\nThe majority of this information has moved into the [Developer's guide](/application-development/?lang=php).\n\nHowever, if you can't find what you are looking for there, we recommend checking this doc set as well.\n\n:::\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n\nimport * as WhatIsATemporalCronJob from '../concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job.md'\n\nThis is how you set a Cron Schedule in PHP:\n\n```php\n  $workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(\n      CronWorkflowInterface::class,\n      WorkflowOptions::new()\n          ->withWorkflowId(CronWorkflowInterface::WORKFLOW_ID)\n          ->withCronSchedule('* * * * *')\n          // Execution timeout limits total time.

Below is an example of how\nto use this in PHP:\n\n```php\npublic function cronWorkflow() {\n    $lastProcessedFileName = Workflow::getLastCompletionResult(Type::TYPE_STRING);\n\n    // Process work starting from the lastProcessedFileName.\n    // Business logic implementation goes here.\n    // Updates lastProcessedFileName to the new value.\n\n    return $lastProcessedFileName;\n}\n```\n\nNote that this works even if one of the cron schedule runs failed. The\nnext schedule will still get the last successful result if it ever successfully\ncompleted at least once. For example, for a daily cron Workflow, if the first day\nrun succeeds and the second day fails, then the third day run will still get\nthe result from first day's run using these APIs.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"error-handling.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/error-handling.md","id":"php/error-handling","title":"Error handling in

Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code\n  might break already open Workflows.\n- Don’t access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow Execution path.\n  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.\n\nWorkflow method arguments and return values are serializable to a byte array using the provided [DataConverter](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html) interface.\nThe default implementation uses JSON serializer, but you can use any alternative serialization mechanism.\n\nMake sure to annotate your `WorkflowMethod` using `ReturnType` to specify concrete return type.\n\n> You can not use the default return type declaration as Workflow methods are generators.\n\nThe values passed to Workflows through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the execution history.\nThe entire execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow workers with every event that the Workflow logic needs to process.\nA large execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.\nTherefore, be mindful of the amount of data that you transfer via Activity invocation parameters or return values.\nOtherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.\\*\\*\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-mock-activities-in-php.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/how-to-mock-activities-in-php.md","id":"php/how-to-mock-activities-in-php","title":"How to mock Activities in PHP","description":"To mock an Activity in PHP, follow the instructions in this article.","label":"Mock Activities","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","php"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n**RoadRunner config**\n\nTo mock an Activity in PHP, use [RoadRunner Key-Value storage](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-kv) and add the following lines to your `tests/.rr.test.yaml` file.\n\n```yaml\n# tests/.rr.test.yaml\nkv:\n  test:\n    driver: memory\n    config:\n      interval: 10\n```\n\nIf you want to be able to mock Activities, use `WorkerFactory` from the `Temporal\\Testing` Namespace\nin your PHP Worker:\n\n```php\n// worker.test.php\nuse Temporal\\Testing\\WorkerFactory;\n\n$factory = WorkerFactory::create();\n$worker = $factory->newWorker();\n\n$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(MyWorkflow::class);\n$worker->registerActivity(MyActivity::class);\n$factory->run();\n```\n\nThen, in your tests to mock an Activity, use the`ActivityMocker` class.\n\nAssume we have the following Activity:\n\n```php\n#[ActivityInterface(prefix: \"SimpleActivity.\")]\ninterface SimpleActivityInterface\n{\n    #[ActivityMethod('doSomething')]\n    public function doSomething(string $input): string;\n```\n\nTo mock it in the test, you can do this:\n\n```php\nfinal class SimpleWorkflowTestCase extends TestCase\n{\n    private WorkflowClient $workflowClient;\n    private ActivityMocker $activityMocks;\n\n    protected function setUp(): void\n    {\n        $this->workflowClient = new WorkflowClient(ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233'));\n        $this->activityMocks = new ActivityMocker();\n\n        parent::setUp();\n    }\n\n    protected function tearDown(): void\n    {\n        $this->activityMocks->clear();\n        parent::tearDown();\n    }\n\n    public function testWorkflowReturnsUpperCasedInput(): void\n    {\n        $this->activityMocks->expectCompletion('SimpleActivity.doSomething', 'world');\n        $workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(SimpleWorkflow::class);\n        $run = $this->workflowClient->start($workflow, 'hello');\n        $this->assertSame('world', $run->getResult('string'));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the preceding test case, we do the following:\n\n1.

The Activity provides the information necessary for completion from an external system and notifies the Temporal service that it is waiting for that outside callback.\n2. The external service calls the Temporal service to complete the Activity.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the first part:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART samples-php-async-activity-completion-activity-class-->\n\n[app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/GreetingActivity.php](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/blob/master/app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/GreetingActivity.php)\n\n```php\nclass GreetingActivity implements GreetingActivityInterface\n{\n    private LoggerInterface $logger;\n\n    public function __construct()\n    {\n        $this->logger = new Logger();\n    }\n    /**\n     * Demonstrates how to implement an Activity asynchronously.\n     * When {@link Activity::doNotCompleteOnReturn()} is called,\n     * the Activity implementation function that returns doesn't complete the Activity.\n     */\n    public function composeGreeting(string $greeting, string $name): string\n    {\n        // In real life this request can be executed anywhere. By a separate service for example.\n        $this->logger->info(sprintf('GreetingActivity token: %s', base64_encode(Activity::getInfo()->taskToken)));\n        // Send the taskToken to the external service that will complete the Activity.\n        // Return from the Activity a function indicating that Temporal should wait\n        // for an async completion message.\n        Activity::doNotCompleteOnReturn();\n        // When doNotCompleteOnReturn() is invoked the return value is ignored.\n        return 'ignored';\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nThe following code demonstrates how to complete the Activity successfully using `WorkflowClient`:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART samples-php-async-activity-completion-completebytoken-->\n\n[app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/CompleteCommand.php](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/blob/master/app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/CompleteCommand.php)\n\n```php\n$client = $this->workflowClient->newActivityCompletionClient();\n// Complete the Activity.\n$client->completeByToken(\n    base64_decode($input->getArgument('token')),\n    $input->getArgument('message')\n);\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nTo fail the Activity, you would do the following:\n\n```php\n// Fail the Activity.\n$activityClient->completeExceptionallyByToken($taskToken, new \\Error(\"activity failed\"));\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-set-timers-in-php.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/how-to-set-timers-in-php.md","id":"php/how-to-set-timers-in-php","title":"How to set Timers in PHP","description":"To set a Timer in PHP, use `Workflow::timer()`.","label":"Timers","tags":["timers","sleep"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTo set a Timer in PHP, use `Workflow::timer()` and pass the number of seconds you want to wait before continuing.\n\nThe following example yields a sleep method for 5 minutes.\n\n```php\nyield Workflow::timer(300); // sleep for 5 minutes\n```\n\nYou cannot set a Timer invocation inside the `await` or `awaitWithTimeout` methods.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-set-workflow-retry-options-in-php.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/how-to-set-workflow-retry-options-in-php.md","id":"php/how-to-set-workflow-retry-options-in-php","title":"How to set Workflow Retry Options in PHP","description":"A Retry Policy can be configured with an instance of the `RetryOptions` object.","label":"Workflow Retry Options","tags":["php","how-to","developer-guide"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Retry Policy can be configured with an instance of the `RetryOptions` object.\nTo enable retries for a Workflow, you need to provide a Retry Policy object via `ChildWorkflowOptions` for Child Workflows or via `WorkflowOptions` for top-level Workflows.\n\n```php\n$workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(\n      CronWorkflowInterface::class,\n      WorkflowOptions::new()->withRetryOptions(\n        RetryOptions::new()->withInitialInterval(120)\n      )\n);\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-set-workflow-timeouts-in-php.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/how-to-set-workflow-timeouts-in-php.md","id":"php/how-to-set-workflow-timeouts-in-php","title":"How to set Workflow Timeouts in PHP","description":"Create an instance of WorkflowOptions.","label":"Workflow Timeouts","tags":["php","how-to"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nCreate an instance of `WorkflowOptions` in the Client code and set your timeout.\n\nAvailable timeouts are:\n\n- `withWorkflowExecutionTimeout()`\n- `withWorkflowRunTimeout()`\n- `withWorkflowTaskTimeout()`\n\n```php\n$workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(\n    DynamicSleepWorkflowInterface::class,\n    WorkflowOptions::new()\n        ->withWorkflowId(DynamicSleepWorkflow::WORKFLOW_ID)\n        ->withWorkflowIdReusePolicy(WorkflowIdReusePolicy::WORKFLOW_ID_REUSE_POLICY_ALLOW_DUPLICATE)\n        // Set Workflow Timeout duration\n        ->withWorkflowExecutionTimeout(CarbonInterval::minutes(2))\n        // ->withWorkflowRunTimeout(CarbonInterval::minute(2))\n        // ->withWorkflowTaskTimeout(CarbonInterval::minute(2))\n);\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-skip-time-set-up-in-php.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/how-to-skip-time-set-up-in-php.md","id":"php/how-to-skip-time-set-up-in-php","title":"How to set up time skipping in PHP","description":"To set up time skipping, create `bootstrap.php` and add it to `phpunit.xml`.","label":"Set up time skipping","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","PHP"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n1.

The started Workflow will not rely on the\ninvocation process and will continue executing even if the waiting process crashes or stops.\n\nBe sure to acquire the Workflow interface or class name you want to start.\nFor example:\n\n```php\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface AccountTransferWorkflowInterface\n{\n    #[WorkflowMethod(name: \"MoneyTransfer\")]\n    #[ReturnType('int')]\n    public

'refID',\n    1000\n);\n```\n\n**Asynchronous start**\n\nAn asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller without waiting for a result.\nThis is the most common way to start Workflows in a live environment.\n\nTo start a Workflow asynchronously, pass the Workflow stub instance and start parameters into the `WorkflowClient`->`start` method.\n\n```php\n$accountTransfer = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(\n    AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class\n);\n\n$run = $this->workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);\n```\n\nAfter the Workflow is started, you can receive the Workflow Id via the `WorkflowRun` object returned by the `start` method:\n\n```php\n$run = $workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);\n\nvar_dump($run->getExecution()->getID());\n```\n\n**Recurring start**\n\nYou can start a Workflow Execution on a regular

You can use the Temporal CLI to perform this query. For\nexample:\n\n`tctl --namespace samples-namespace workflow query -w your_workflow_id -r your_run_id -qt __stack_trace`\n\n> You can also access the stack trace from Temporal Web UI.\n\nThis command uses `__stack_trace`, which is a built-in query type supported by the Temporal client\nlibrary. You can add custom query types to handle queries such as querying the current state of a\nWorkflow, or querying how many Activities the Workflow has completed. To do this, you need to set\nup a query handler using method attribute `QueryMethod` or `Workflow::registerQueryHandler`.\n\n```php\n#[Workflow\\WorkflowInterface]\nclass YourWorkflow\n{\n    #[Workflow\\QueryMethod]\n    public function getValue()\n    {\n        return 42;\n    }\n\n    #[Workflow\\WorkflowMethod]\n    public function run()\n    {\n        // workflow code\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nThe handler function can receive any number of input parameters, but all input parameters must be\nserializable. The following sample code sets up a query handler that handles the query type of\n`currentState`:\n\n```php\n#[Workflow\\WorkflowInterface]\nclass YourWorkflow\n{\n    private string $currentState;\n\n    #[Workflow\\QueryMethod('current_state')]\n    public function getCurrentState(): string\n    {\n        return $this->currentState;\n    }\n\n    #[Workflow\\WorkflowMethod]\n    public function run()\n    {\n        // Your normal Workflow code begins here, and you update the currentState\n        // as the code makes progress.\n        $this->currentState = 'waiting timer';\n        try{\n            yield Workflow::timer(DateInterval::createFromDateString('1 hour'));\n        } catch (\\Throwable $e) {\n            $this->currentState = 'timer failed';\n            throw $e;\n        }\n\n        $yourActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(\n            YourActivityInterface::class,\n            ActivityOptions::new()->withScheduleToStartTimeout(60)\n        );\n\n        $this->currentState = 'waiting activity';\n        try{\n            yield $YourActivity->doSomething('some input');\n        } catch (\\Throwable $e) {\n            $this->currentState = 'activity failed';\n            throw $e;\n        }\n\n        $this->currentState = 'done';\n\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can now query `current_state` by using the CLI:\n\n`tctl --namespace samples-namespace workflow query -w your_workflow_id -r your_run_id -qt current_state`\n\nYou can also issue a query from code using the `QueryWorkflow()` API on a Temporal client object.\n\nUse `WorkflowStub` to query Workflow instances from your client code.\n(You can apply this technique to running Workflows as well.)\n\n```php\n$workflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(\n    YourWorkflow::class,\n    WorkflowOptions::new()\n);\n\n$workflowClient->start($workflow);\n\nvar_dump($workflow->getCurrentState());\nsleep(60);\nvar_dump($workflow->getCurrentState());\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"retries.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/retries.md","id":"php/retries","title":"Activity and Workflow Retries","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n:::info Try the Developer's guide\n\nThe majority of this information has moved into the [Developer's guide](/application-development/?lang=php).\n\nHowever, if you can't find what you are looking for there, we recommend checking this doc set as well.\n\n:::\n\nActivities and Workflows can fail for a number of expected and unexpected reasons.\nIn most failure cases, we want to retry the failed Activity or Child Workflow or even the parent Workflow.\nBy default, Temporal retries Activities, but not Workflows.\nTo change the default behavior, a custom Retry Policy can be provided.\n\nTo change the default behavior, a custom Retry Policy can be provided.\n\nA Retry Policy is defined as a `Temporal\\Common\\RetryOptions` object:\n\n```php\nuse Temporal\\Common\\RetryOptions;\n\n$retry = RetryOptions::new()\n\n    // Backoff interval for the first retry. If coefficient is 1.0\n    // then it is used for all retries. Required, no default value.\n    ->withInitialInterval(120) // seconds or DateInterval\n\n    // Coefficient used to calculate the next retry backoff interval.\n    // The next retry interval is previous interval multiplied\n    // by this coefficient.\n    // Must be 1 or larger. Default is 2.0.\n    ->withBackoffCoefficient(1)\n\n    // Maximum backoff interval between retries. Exponential backoff\n    // leads to interval increase. This value is the cap of the interval.\n    // Default is 100x of initial interval.\n    ->withMaximumInterval(600) // seconds or DateInterval\n\n    // Maximum number of attempts. When exceeded the retries stop even\n    // if not expired yet. If not set or set to 0, it means unlimited\n    ->withMaximumAttempts(10)\n\n    // Non-Retriable errors. This is optional. Temporal server will stop\n    // retry if error type matches this list.\n    //\n    // Note:\n    //  - cancellation is not a failure, so it won't be retried,\n    //  - only StartToClose or Heartbeat timeouts are retryable.\n    ->withNonRetryableExceptions([\\App\\DatabaseException::class]);\n```\n\nTo enable or customize retries, provide a custom Retry Policy as part of `ActivityOptions` or `ChildWorkflowOptions`.\n\n```php\n$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(\n    GreetingActivityInterface::class,\n    ActivityOptions::new()\n        ->withScheduleToCloseTimeout(CarbonInterval::seconds(10))\n        ->withRetryOptions(\n            RetryOptions::new()->withMaximumAttempts(10)\n        )\n);\n```\n\nIf an Activity heartbeat its progress before it failed, the retry attempt will have access to the progress information,\nso that the Activity implementation could resume from the failed step. Here's an example of how this can be implemented:\n\n```php\nuse Temporal\\Activity;\nuse Temporal\\DataConverter\\Type;\n// ...\n\n#[Activity\\ActivityInterface('YourActivity_')]\nclass YourActivity\n{\n  public function sampleActivity(int $startIndex, int $lastIndex)\n  {\n      if (Activity::hasHeartbeatDetails()) {\n          // Recover from finished progress.\n          $lastIndex = Activity::getHeartbeatDetails(Type::TYPE_INT);\n          $startIndex = $lastIndex + 1;// Start from next one.\n      }\n\n      // Normal Activity logic...\n      for ($i = $startIndex; $i < $lastIndex; $i++) {\n          // Code for processing item i goes here...\n          Activity::recordHeartbeat($i); // Report progress.\n      }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo enable retries for a Workflow, you need to provide a Retry Policy via `ChildWorkflowOptions` for Child Workflows or via `WorkflowOptions` for top-level Workflows.\n\nThere are some subtle nuances to how Workflow's history events are recorded when a `RetryOptions` is used.\nFor an Activity with a `RetryOptions`:\n\n- The `ActivityTaskScheduledEvent` will have extended `ScheduleToStartTimeout` and `ScheduleToCloseTimeout`.\n- The `ActivityTaskStartedEvent` will not show up in history until the Activity is completed or failed with no more retry.\n  This is to avoid filling the history with noise records of intermittent failures and retries.\n  For Activities being retried, `DescribeWorkflowExecution` will return a `PendingActivityInfo` that includes `attemptCount`.\n\nFor a Workflow with `RetryOptions`:\n\n- If a Workflow fails and a Retry Policy is configured for it, the Workflow Execution will be closed with a `ContinueAsNew` event.\n  This event will have the `ContinueAsNewInitiator` field set to `RetryOptions` and the new `RunId` for the next retry attempt.\n- The new attempt is created immediately.\n  But the first Workflow Task won't be scheduled until the end of the backoff duration.\n  That duration is recorded as the `firstWorkflowTaskBackoff` field of the new run's `WorkflowExecutionStartedEventAttributes` event.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"side-effect.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/side-effect.md","id":"php/side-effect","title":"SideEffect","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n`Workflow::sideEffect` is useful for short, non-deterministic code snippets, such as getting a random\nvalue or generating a UUID.

Instead, it uses a light-weight testing server.\n\n### Quick start\n\n1. Create `bootstrap.php` in `tests` folder with the following contents:\n\n```php\ndeclare(strict_types=1);\n\nrequire __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';\n\nuse Temporal\\Testing\\Environment;\n\n$environment = Environment::create();\n$environment->start();\nregister_shutdown_function(fn () => $environment->stop());\n```\n\n2. Add `bootstrap.php` to your `phpunit.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<phpunit xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"https://schema.phpunit.de/9.3/phpunit.xsd\"\n         bootstrap=\"tests/bootstrap.php\"\n>\n</phpunit>\n```\n\n3. Add test server executable to `.gitignore`:\n\n```gitignore\ntemporal-test-server\n```\n\n### How it works\n\nFor testing workflows there is no need to run a full Temporal server (with storage and UI interface).\nInstead, we can use a light-weight test server.\n\nThe code in `bootstrap.php` will start and stop (and download if it doesn't exist) the Temporal test server and RoadRunner for every phpunit run.\nThe test server runs as a regular server on 7233 port.\nThus, if you use default connection settings, there is no need to change them.\n\nUnder the hood RoadRunner is started with `rr serve` command. You can specify your own command in `bootstrap.php`:\n\n```php\n$environment->start('./rr serve -c .rr.test.yaml -w tests');\n```\n\nThe snippet above will start Temporal test server and RoadRunner with `.rr.test.yaml` config and `tests` working\n\ndirectory. Having a separate RoadRunner config file for tests can be useful to mock you activities. For\nexample, you can create a separate _worker_ that registers activity implementations mocks:\n\n```yaml\n# test/.rr.test.yaml\nserver:\n  command: \"php worker.test.php\"\n```\n\nAnd within the worker you register your Workflows and mock Activities:\n\n```php\n// worker.test.php\n$factory = WorkerFactory::create();\n\n$worker = $factory->newWorker();\n$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(YourWorkflow::class);\n$worker->registerActivity(MyActvivityMock::class);\n$factory->run();\n```\n\nYou can test Workflows by running them with a Workflow Client like this:\n\n```php\nfinal class SimpleWorkflowTestCase extends TestCase\n{\n    private WorkflowClient $workflowClient;\n\n    protected function setUp(): void\n    {\n        $this->workflowClient = new WorkflowClient(\n            ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233')\n        );\n\n        parent::setUp();\n    }\n\n    public function testWorkflowReturnsUpperCasedInput(): void\n    {\n        $workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(SimpleWorkflow::class);\n        $run = $this->workflowClient->start($workflow, 'hello');\n        $this->assertSame('HELLO', $run->getResult('string'));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Time management\n\nIf we consider Activities as some external code that can be mocked than unit-testing your Workflows becomes\nstraight-forward:\n\n1. Register activity mocks in a separate \"test\" worker.\n2. In your test create a `WorkflowClient`.\n3. Use `WorkflowClient` to run the Workflow and assert the result.\n\nThe problem may occur when your Workflow depends on some time changes: it waits for timeout or some other conditions.\nIn unit tests, we don't want to waste time waiting for timeouts.\n\nThus, by default, the test server starts with a _\"time-skipping\"_ option.\nIt means that if the Workflow has a timer, the server doesn't wait for it and continues immediately.\nFor example, when testing such a Workflow the test server will not wait for a minute:\n\n```php\n#[WorkflowInterface]\nfinal class WaitWorkflow\n{\n    #[WorkflowMethod]\n    public function run(string $input)\n    {\n        $simple = Workflow::newActivityStub(\n            SimpleActivity::class,\n            ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(5)\n        );\n\n        yield Workflow::timer('1 minute');\n\n        return yield $simple->echo($input);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe activity will be called immediately. But, there may be cases when you do need to wait. So, to change this behaviour\nyou can use `TestService` class:\n\n```php\n$testService = TestService::create('localhost:7233');\n$testService->lockTimeSkipping();\n\n// ...\n$testService->unlockTimeSkipping();\n```\n\nClass `TestService` communicates with a test server and provides method for _time management_. Time skipping\ncan be switched on/off with `unlockTimeSkipping()` and `lockTimeSkipping()` method:\n\n```php\nfinal class WaitTestCase extends TestCase\n{\n    private WorkflowClient $workflowClient;\n\n    protected function setUp(): void\n    {\n        $this->workflowClient = new WorkflowClient(\n            ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233')\n        );\n\n        parent::setUp();\n    }\n\n    public function testSimpleAwait()\n    {\n        $testService = TestService::create('localhost:7233');\n        $testService->lockTimeSkipping();\n\n        $wait = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(WaitWorkflow::class);\n        $run = $this->workflowClient->start($wait, 'hello');\n\n        $testService->unlockTimeSkipping();\n        $this->assertSame('HELLO', $run->getResult('string'));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor convenience if you don't want to skip time in the whole `TestCase` class use `WithoutTimeSkipping`:\n\n```php\nfinal class WaitTestCase extends TestCase\n{\n    use WithoutTimeSkipping;\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn case you need to emulate some \"waiting\" on a test server, you can use `sleep(int seconds)` or `sleepUntil(int $timestamp)` methods.\n\nCurrent server time can be retrieved with `getCurrentTime(): Carbon` method.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"versioning.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/versioning.md","id":"php/versioning","title":"Versioning","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nThe definition code of a Temporal Workflow must be deterministic because Temporal uses event sourcing\nto reconstruct the Workflow state by replaying the saved history event data on the Workflow\ndefinition code. This means that any incompatible update to the Workflow Definition code could cause\na non-deterministic issue if not handled correctly.\n\n## Workflow::getVersion()\n\nConsider the following Workflow Definition:\n\n```php\npublic function yourWorkflow(string $data)\n{\n    $yourActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(\n        YourActivityInterface::class,\n        ActivityOptions::new()\n            ->withScheduleToStartTimeout(60)\n    );\n\n    $result1 = yield $yourActivity->activityA($data);\n    $result2 = yield $yourActivity->activityB($result1);\n\n    return $result2;\n}\n```\n\nNow let's say we have replaced `ActivityA` with `ActivityC`, and deployed the updated code. If there\nis an existing Workflow Execution that was started by the original version of the Workflow code, where\n`ActivityA` had already completed and the result was recorded to history, the new version of the Workflow\ncode will pick up that Workflow Execution and try to resume from there. However, the Workflow **will fail**\nbecause the new code expects a result for `ActivityC` from the history data, but instead it gets the\nresult for `ActivityA`. This causes the Workflow to fail on the non-deterministic error.\n\nThus we use `Workflow::getVersion()`.\n\n```php\n$yourActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(\n    YourActivityInterface::class,\n    ActivityOptions::new()\n        ->withScheduleToStartTimeout(60)\n);\n\n$v = yield Workflow::getVersion('Step1', Workflow::DEFAULT_VERSION, 1);\n\nif ($v === Workflow::DEFAULT_VERSION) {\n    $result1 = yield $yourActivity->activityA($data);\n} else {\n    $result1 = yield $yourActivity->activityC($data);\n}\n\n$result2 = yield $yourActivity->activityB($result1);\n\nreturn $result2;\n```\n\nWhen `Workflow::getVersion()` is run for the new Workflow Execution, it records a marker in the Workflow history so that all future calls to `GetVersion` for this change Id—`Step 1` in the example—on this Workflow Execution will always return the given version number, which is `1` in the example.\n\nIf you make an additional change, such as replacing ActivityC with ActivityD, you need to\nadd some additional code:\n\n```php\n$v = yield Workflow::getVersion('Step1', Workflow::DEFAULT_VERSION, 2);\n\nif ($v === Workflow::DEFAULT_VERSION) {\n    $result1 = yield $yourActivity->activityA($data);\n} elseif ($v === 1) {\n    $result1 = yield $yourActivity->activityC($data);\n} else {\n    $result1 = yield $yourActivity->activityD($data);\n}\n```\n\nNote that we have changed `maxSupported` from 1 to 2. A Workflow that had already passed this\n`GetVersion()` call before it was introduced will return `DEFAULT_VERSION`. A Workflow that was run\nwith `maxSupported` set to 1, will return 1. New Workflows will return 2.\n\nAfter you are sure that all of the Workflow Executions prior to version 1 have completed, you can remove the code for that version.\nIt should now look like the following:\n\n```php\n$v = yield Workflow::getVersion('Step1', 1, 2);\n\nif ($v === 1) {\n    $result1 = yield $yourActivity->activityC($data);\n} else {\n    $result1 = yield $yourActivity->activityD($data);\n}\n```\n\nYou'll note that `minSupported` has changed from `DEFAULT_VERSION` to `1`.\nIf an older version of the Workflow Execution history is replayed on this code, it fails because the minimum expected version is 1.\nAfter you are sure that all Workflow Executions for version 1 have completed, you can remove version 1 so that your code looks like the following:\n\n```php\nyield Workflow::getVersion('Step1', 2, 2);\n\n$result1 = yield $yourActivity->activityD($data);\n```\n\nNote that we have preserved the call to `GetVersion()`. There are two reasons to preserve this call:\n\n1. This ensures that if there is a Workflow Execution still running for an older version, it will\n   fail here and not proceed.\n2. If you need to make additional changes for `Step1`, such as changing ActivityD to ActivityE, you\n   only need to update `maxVersion` from 2 to 3 and branch from there.\n\nYou only need to preserve the first call to `GetVersion()` for each `changeID`. All subsequent calls to\n`GetVersion()` with the same change Id are safe to remove. If necessary, you can remove the first\n`GetVersion()` call, but you need to ensure the following:\n\n- All executions with an older version are completed.\n- You can no longer use `Step1` for the changeId. If you need to make changes to that same part in\n  the future, such as change from ActivityD to ActivityE, you would need to use a different changeId\n  like `Step1-fix2`, and start minVersion from DefaultVersion again. The code would look like the\n  following:\n\n```php\n$v = yield Workflow::getVersion('Step1-fix2', Workflow::DEFAULT_VERSION, 1);\n\nif ($v === Workflow::DEFAULT_VERSION) {\n    $result1 = yield $yourActivity->activityD($data);\n} else {\n    $result1 = yield $yourActivity->activityE($data);\n}\n```\n\nUpgrading a Workflow is straightforward if you don't need to preserve your currently running Workflow Executions.\nYou can simply terminate all of the currently running Workflow Executions and suspend new ones from being created while you deploy the new version of your Workflow code, which does not use `GetVersion()`, and then resume Workflow creation.\nHowever, that is often not the case, and you need to take care of the currently running Workflow Executions, so using `GetVersion()` to update your code is the method to use.\n\nHowever, if you want your currently running Workflows to proceed based on the current Workflow logic,\nbut you want to ensure new Workflows are running on new logic, you can define your Workflow as a\nnew `WorkflowType`, and change your start path (calls to `StartWorkflow()`) to start the new Workflow\ntype.\n\n## Sanity checking\n\nThe Temporal client SDK performs a sanity check to help prevent obvious incompatible changes.\nThe sanity check verifies whether a Command made in replay matches the event recorded in history,\nin the same order. The Command is generated by calling any of the following methods:\n\n- Workflow::executeActivity()\n- Workflow::executeChildWorkflow()\n- Workflow::timer()\n- Workflow::sideEffect()\n- Workflow::newActivityStub() execute\n- Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub() start and signal\n- Workflow::newExternalWorkflowStub() start and signal\n\nAdding, removing, or reordering any of the above methods triggers the sanity check and results in\na non-deterministic error.\n\nThe sanity check does not perform a thorough check. For example, it does not check on the Activity's\ninput arguments or the timer duration. If the check is enforced on every property, then it becomes\ntoo restricted and harder to maintain the Workflow code. For example, if you move your Activity code\nfrom one package to another package, that changes the `ActivityType`, which technically becomes a different\nActivity. But, we don't want to fail on that change, so we only check the function name part of the\n`ActivityType`.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"workers.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/workers.md","id":"php/workers","title":"Workers in PHP","label":"Workers","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n:::info Try the Developer's guide\n\nThe majority of this information has moved into the [Developer's guide](/application-development/?lang=php).\n\nHowever, if you can't find what you are looking for there, we recommend checking this doc set as well.\n\n:::\n\nThe [RoadRunner application server](https://roadrunner.dev/) will launch multiple Temporal PHP worker processes based on provided `.rr.yaml` configuration.\n\nEach worker might connect to one or multiple task queues.

It must have a `void` return type.\n- **#[QueryMethod]** indicates a method that reacts to synchronous query requests. It must have a non `void` return type.\n\n> It is possible (though not recommended for usability reasons) to annotate concrete class implementation.\n\nYou can have more than one method with the same annotation (except #[WorkflowMethod]).\n\nFor example:\n\n```php\nuse Temporal\\Workflow\\WorkflowInterface;\nuse Temporal\\Workflow\\WorkflowMethod;\nuse Temporal\\Workflow\\SignalMethod;\nuse Temporal\\Workflow\\QueryMethod;\n\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface FileProcessingWorkflow\n{\n    #[WorkflowMethod]\n    public function processFile(Argument $args);\n\n    #[QueryMethod(\"history\")]\n    public function getHistory(): array;\n\n    #[QueryMethod(\"status\")]\n    public function getStatus(): string;\n\n    #[SignalMethod]\n    public function retryNow(): void;\n\n    #[SignalMethod]\n    public function abandon(): void;\n}\n```\n\nNote that name parameter of Workflow method annotations can be used to specify name of Workflow, signal and query types.\nIf name is not specified the short name of the Workflow interface is used.\n\nIn the above code the `#[WorkflowMethod(name)]` is not specified, thus the Workflow Type defaults to `\"FileProcessingWorkflow\"`.\n\n## Workflow Interface Inheritance\n\nWorkflow interfaces can form inheritance hierarchies.\nIt may be useful for creating components reusable across multiple Workflow types.\nFor example imaging a UI or CLI button that allows to call `retryNow` signal on any Workflow.\nTo implement this feature you can redesign the above interface to:\n\n```php\n#[WorkflowInterface\ninterface Retryable {\n    #[SignalMethod]\n    public function retryNow(): void;\n}\n\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface FileProcessingWorkflow extends Retryable {\n\n    #[WorkflowMethod]\n    #[ReturnType(\"string\")]\n    public function processFile(Argument $args);\n\n    #[QueryMethod(\"history\")]\n    public function getHistory(): array;\n\n    #[QueryMethod(\"status\")]\n    public function getStatus(): string;\n\n    #[SignalMethod]\n    public function abandon(): void;\n}\n```\n\nThen some other Workflow can implement it as well:\n\n```php\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface MediaProcessingWorkflow extends Retryable {\n    #[WorkflowMethod]\n    public function processBlob(Argument $args);\n}\n```\n\nThen it would be possible to send signal to both of them using the Retryable interface only:\n\n```php\n$r = $workflowClient->newRunningWorkflowStub(Retryable::class, $workflowId);\n$r->retryNow();\n```\n\nThe same technique can be used to query Workflows through a base interface.\n\nNote that an attempt to start Workflow through a base interface annotated with `#[WorkflowInterface]` is not going to work.\nLet's look at the following **invalid** example:\n\n```php\n// INVALID CODE!\n\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface BaseWorkflow {\n    #[WorkflowMethod]\n    public function start();\n}\n\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface Workflow1 extends BaseWorkflow {}\n\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface Workflow2 extends BaseWorkflow {}\n```\n\nAn attempt to register implementations of Workflow1 and Workflow2 are going to fail as they are going to use the same Workflow Type.\nThe type is defined by the type of the class which is annotated with `#[WorkflowInterface]`.\nIn this case `BaseWorkflow`.\nThe solution is to remove `#[WorkflowInterface]` annotation from BaseWorkflow.\nThe following is valid code:\n\n```php\ninterface BaseWorkflow {\n    #[WorkflowMethod]\n    public function start();\n}\n\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface Workflow1 extends BaseWorkflow {}\n\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface Workflow2 extends BaseWorkflow {}\n```\n\nImplementations of Workflow1 and Workflow2 can registered with the same worker as they will have types defined by their interfaces.\n\n## Implementing Workflows\n\nA Workflow implementation implements a Workflow interface.\nEach time a new Workflow Execution is started, a new instance of the Workflow implementation object is created.\nThen, one of the methods (depending on which Workflow Type has been started) annotated with `#[WorkflowMethod]` is invoked.\nAs soon as this method returns, the Workflow Execution is closed.\nWhile Workflow Execution is open, it can receive calls to signal and query methods.\nNo additional calls to Workflow methods are allowed.\nThe Workflow object is stateful, so query and signal methods can communicate with the other parts of the Workflow through Workflow object fields.\n\n### Constraints\n\nTemporal uses the [Microsoft Azure Event Sourcing pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) to recover the state of a Workflow object including its local variable values.\n\nIn essence, every time a Workflow state has to be restored, its code is re-executed from the beginning.\nWhen replaying, side effects (such as Activity invocations) are ignored because they are already recorded in the Workflow event history.\nWhen writing Workflow logic, the replay is not visible, so the code should be written since it executes only once.\nThis design puts the following constraints on the Workflow implementation:\n\n- Do not use any mutable global variables because multiple instances of Workflows are executed in parallel.\n- Do not call any non-deterministic functions like non seeded random or `UUID` directly from the Workflow code.\n\nAlways do the following in the Workflow implementation code:\n\n- Don’t perform any IO or service calls as they are not usually deterministic. Use Activities for this.\n- Only use `Workflow::now()` to get the current time inside a Workflow.\n- Call `yield Workflow::timer()` instead of `sleep()`.\n- Do not use any blocking SPL provided by PHP (i.e. `fopen`, `PDO`, etc) in **Workflow code**.\n- Use `yield Workflow::getVersion()` when making any changes to the Workflow code. Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code\n  might break already open Workflows.\n- Don’t access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow Execution path.\n  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.\n\nWorkflow method arguments and return values are serializable to a byte array using the provided [DataConverter](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html) interface.\nThe default implementation uses JSON serializer, but you can use any alternative serialization mechanism.\n\nMake sure to annoate your `WorkflowMethod` using `ReturnType` to specify concrete return type.\n\n> You can not use the default return type declaration as Workflow methods are generators.\n\nThe values passed to Workflows through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the execution history.\nThe entire execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow workers with every event that the Workflow logic needs to process.\nA large execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.\nTherefore, be mindful of the amount of data that you transfer via Activity invocation parameters or return values.\nOtherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.\n\n## Awaits\n\nUse specialized construct `Workflow::await` and `Workflow::awaitWithTimeout` to wait for Closure function become positive.\n\n```php\n$done = false;\nWorkflow::async(\n    function () use (&$done) {\n        $hello = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hello', $name);\n\n        $done = true;\n    }\n);\n\n// wait for $done to become true\nyield Workflow::await(fn() => $done);\n```\n\nYou cannot use any Activity, timer, or Child Workflow invocations inside the `await` or `awaitWithTimeout` method.\nHowever, you can use variables referenced by other coroutines.\n\n## Timers\n\nUse `Workflow::timer()` to yield long sleeps:\n\n```php\nyield Workflow::timer(300); // sleep for 5 minutes\n```\n\n## Starting Workflows\n\nWorkflows can be started both synchronously and asynchronously.\nYou can use typed or untyped workflows stubs available via `Temporal\\Client\\WorkflowClient`.\nTo create a Workflow Client:\n\n```php\nuse Temporal\\Client\\GRPC\\ServiceClient;\nuse Temporal\\Client\\WorkflowClient;\n\n$workflowClient = WorkflowClient::create(ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233'));\n```\n\n### Synchronous start\n\nA Synchronous start initiates a Workflow and then waits for its completion. The started Workflow will not rely on the\ninvocation process and will continue executing even if the waiting process crashes or stops.\n\nBe sure to acquire the Workflow interface or class name you want to start.\nFor example:\n\n```php\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface AccountTransferWorkflowInterface\n{\n    #[WorkflowMethod(name: \"MoneyTransfer\")]\n    #[ReturnType('int')]\n    public function transfer(\n        string $fromAccountId,\n        string $toAccountId,\n        string $referenceId,\n        int $amountCents\n    );\n}\n```\n\nTo start the Workflow in sync mode:\n\n```php\n$accountTransfer = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(\n    AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class\n);\n\n$result = $accountTransfer->transfer(\n    'fromID',\n    'toID',\n    'refID',\n    1000\n);\n```\n\n### Asynchronous start\n\nAn asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller without waiting for a result.\nThis is the most common way to start Workflows in a live environment.\n\nTo start a Workflow asynchronously, pass the Workflow stub instance and start parameters into the `WorkflowClient->start` method.\n\n```php\n$accountTransfer = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(\n    AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class\n);\n\n$run = $this->workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);\n```\n\nWhen started, you can receive the Workflow Id and Run Id via the `WorkflowRun` object returned by the `start` method:\n\n```php\n$run = $workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);\n\nvar_dump($run->getExecution()->getID());\n```\n\n### Recurring start\n\nYou can start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule with [the CronSchedule option](distributed-cron).\n\n## Connect to Running Workflows\n\nIf you need to wait for the completion of a Workflow after an asynchronous start, make a blocking call to\nthe `WorkflowRun`->`getResult` method.\n\n```php\n$run = $workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);\n\nvar_dump($run->getResult());\n```\n\nYou can always connect to an existing Workflow and wait for its completion from another process by using Workflow Id.\nUse `WorkflowClient->newUntypedRunningWorkflowStub` for such purposes.\n\n```php\n$workflow = $workflowClient->newUntypedRunningWorkflowStub('workflowID');\n\nvar_dump($workflow->getResult());\n```\n\n## Child Workflows\n\nBesides Activities, a Workflow can also start other Workflows.\n\n<RelatedReadList\nreadlist={[\n[\"What is a Child Workflow Execution?\",\"/concepts/what-is-a-child-workflow-execution\",\"explanation\"],\\\n]}\n/>\n\n## PHP Child Workflow API\n\n`Workflow::executeChildWorkflow` and `Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub` enables the scheduling of other Workflows from within a Workflow's implementation.\nThe parent Workflow has the ability to monitor and impact the lifecycle of the Child Workflow, similar to the way it does for an Activity that it invoked.\n\n```php\n// Use one stub per child workflow run\n$child = Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub(\n    ChildWorkflowInterface::class,\n    ChildWorkflowOptions::new()\n        // Do not specify WorkflowId if you want Temporal to generate a unique Id\n        // for the child execution.\n        ->withWorkflowId('BID-SIMPLE-CHILD-WORKFLOW')\n        ->withExecutionStartToCloseTimeout(DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 minutes'))\n);\n\n// This is a non blocking call that returns immediately.\n// Use yield $child->workflowMethod(name) to call synchronously.\n$promise = $child->workflowMethod('value');\n\n// Do something else here.\ntry{\n    $value = yield $promise;\n} catch(TemporalException $e) {\n    $logger->error('child workflow failed');\n    throw $e;\n}\n```\n\nLet's take a look at each component of this call.\n\nBefore calling `$child->workflowMethod()`, you must configure `ChildWorkflowOptions` for the invocation.\nThese options customize various execution timeouts and are passed into the Workflow stub defined by the `Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub`.\nAfter the stub is created, you can invoke its Workflow method based on the `WorkflowMethod` attribute.\n\nThe method call returns immediately and returns a `Promise`.\nThis allows you to execute more code without having to wait for the scheduled Workflow to complete.\n\nWhen you are ready to process the results of the Workflow, call the `yield $promise` method on the returned promise object.\n\nWhen a parent Workflow is cancelled by the user, the Child Workflow can be cancelled or abandoned based on a configurable child policy.\n\nYou can also skip the stub part of Child Workflow initiation and use `Workflow::executeChildWorkflow` directly:\n\n```php\n// Use one stub per child workflow run\n$childResult = yield Workflow::executeChildWorkflow(\n    'ChildWorkflowName',\n    ['args'],\n    ChildWorkflowOptions::new()->withWorkflowId('BID-SIMPLE-CHILD-WORKFLOW'),\n    Type::TYPE_STRING // optional: defines the return type\n);\n```\n\n## Large event histories\n\nWorkflows that need to rerun periodically could naively be implemented as a big **while** loop with a sleep where the entire logic of the Workflow is inside the body of the **while** loop.\nThe problem with this approach is that the history for that Workflow will keep growing to a point where it reaches the maximum size enforced by the service.\n\n**ContinueAsNew** is the low level construct that enables implementing such Workflows without the risk of failures down the road.\nThe operation atomically completes the current execution and starts a new execution of the Workflow with the same **Workflow Id**.\nThe new execution will not carry over any history from the old execution.\n\nTo trigger this behavior, use `Workflow::continueAsNew` or `Workflow::newContinueAsNewStub` method:\n\n```php\n#[Workflow\\WorkflowMethod]\npublic function periodic(string $name, int $value = 0)\n{\n    for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++) {\n        // do something\n        $value++;\n    }\n\n    // maintain $value counter between runs\n    return Workflow::newContinueAsNewStub(self::class)->periodic($name, $value);\n}\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"activities.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/activities.md","id":"typescript/activities","title":"Activities

Any code that needs to talk to the outside world needs to be in an Activity, not a Workflow.\n- **Separate from Workflows**: Activities cannot be in the same file as Workflows and must be separately registered (see below for [How to register an Activity on a Worker](#how-to-register-an-activity-on-a-worker))\n- **Idempotency**: Activities may be retried repeatedly, so you may need to use [idempotency keys](https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency) for critical side effects.\n- The `'@temporalio/activity'` package offers useful utilities for Activity functions such as sleeping, Heartbeating, cancellation, and retrieving metadata (see [docs on Activity Context utilities](#activity-context-utilities) below).\n\n## How to write an Activity Function\n\nActivities are _simply functions_.\nBelow is a simple Activity that accepts a string parameter and returns a string:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-hello-activity {\"enable_source_link\": false}-->\n\n```ts\nexport async function greet(name: string): Promise<string> {\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n## How to import and use Activities in a Workflow\n\nYou must first retrieve an Activity from an \"Activity Handle\" before you can call it.\nNote that we only import the type of our activities, the TypeScript compiler will drop the import statement on compilation.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-hello-workflow {\"enable_source_link\": false}-->\n\n```ts\nimport { proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n// Only import the activity types\nimport type * as activities from './activities';\n\nconst { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',\n});\n\n/** A workflow that simply calls an activity */\nexport async function example(name: string): Promise<string> {\n  return await greet(name);\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n:::danger Wrong way to import activities\n\nYou may be tempted to import activities directly instead of using `proxyActivities`:\n\n```ts\nimport { greet } from './activities';\n// error when you try to use the function in your code\ngreet('Hello world');\n```\n\nThis will result in a Webpack error, because the Temporal Worker will try to bundle this as part of the Workflow.\nMake sure you're using `proxyActivities` to retrieve an Activity rather than calling the function directly.\nThis indirection comes from the fact that Activities are run in the regular Node.js environment, not the deterministic `vm` where Workflows are run.\n\nSee also our [docs on Webpack troubleshooting](/typescript/troubleshooting/).\n\n:::\n\nThe return value of `proxyActivities` is not a normal object, it is a [`Proxy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) object that calls the TypeScript SDK's internal `scheduleActivity()` function when you reference an activity.\nThis is necessary due to the decoupled nature of Workflows and Activities, but also allows strong typing from a single import, and some nice patterns we explain below.\n\n### Activity Options\n\nWhen you call `proxyActivities` in a Workflow function, there are [a range of ActivityOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.ActivityOptions) you can set:\n\n```ts\n// Sample of typical options you can set while creating a proxy for the `greet` Activity\nconst { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  // recommended\n  startToCloseTimeout: '30s',\n  // useful\n  scheduleToCloseTimeout: '5m',\n  // The below is a Retry Policy. It is used to retry the Activity if it fails.\n  retry: {\n    // These are the values of the Default Retry Policy\n    initialInterval: '1s',\n    backoffCoefficient: 2,\n    maximumAttempts: Infinity,\n    maximumInterval: 100 * initialInterval,\n    nonRetryableErrorTypes: [],\n  },\n});\n```\n\nWe explain the Timeouts and Retries below. You can also specify `taskQueue`, `cancellationType`, and `activityId`, but most users will not need these.\n\n### Activity Timeouts\n\nTimeouts and Retries are the most immediate benefit of moving code onto Temporal.\nThere are [four Activity Timeouts](https://temporal.io/blog/activity-timeouts) you can set.\nWhen a Timeout happens, your activity will be retried according to your [`RetryPolicy`](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy/).\n\n- `startToCloseTimeout`: Maximum time of a single Activity Execution attempt. **We recommend always setting this**. [More info](/concepts/what-is-a-start-to-close-timeout/)\n- `scheduleToCloseTimeout`: Total time that a Workflow is willing to wait for Activity to complete. [More info](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule-to-close-timeout/)\n- `heartbeatTimeout`: A best practice to set for long-running activities. [More info](/concepts/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout/)\n- `scheduleToStartTimeout`: Not recommended; Only for task routing. [More info](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule-to-start-timeout/)\n\nYou can specify timeouts as number of milliseconds, or a string to be parsed to number of milliseconds by the [`ms`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms) package:\n\n```ts\n// Example 1\nconst { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute', // translates to 60000 ms\n});\n\n// Example 2\nconst { longRunningActivity } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  // translates to 300000 ms\n  scheduleToCloseTimeout: '5m',\n  // translates to 30000 ms\n  startToCloseTimeout: '30s',\n  // equivalent to '10 seconds'\n  heartbeatTimeout: 10000,\n});\n```\n\n### Activity Retry Policy\n\nYou can set a `retry` policy with [RetryPolicy](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.RetryPolicy/) that define how activity is retried in case of failure.\n\n```ts\n// Example 1 - default\nconst { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '20s',\n  retry: {\n    // default retry policy if not specified\n    initialInterval: '1s',\n    backoffCoefficient: 2,\n    maximumAttempts: Infinity,\n    maximumInterval: 100 * initialInterval,\n    nonRetryableErrorTypes: [],\n  },\n});\n\n// Example 2 - no retries\nconst { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '20s',\n  retry: {\n    // guarantee no retries\n    maximumAttempts: 1,\n  },\n});\n\n// Example 3 - linear retries up to 5x\nconst { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '20s',\n  retry: {\n    // retry every 1s, no exponential backoff\n    backoffCoefficient: 1,\n    // max 5 attempts\n    maximumAttempts: 5,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nFor a proper guide to each Retry Option, see the [RetryPolicy API Reference](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.RetryPolicy/).\n\nAs you customize your Workflow errors to be more descriptive, advanced users will want to become familiar with [Temporal's Failure classes](/typescript/handling-failure).\n\n## How to register an Activity on a Worker\n\nAll activities must be registered by a Worker, or you will get an error that looks like `\"Activity function yourActivity is not registered on this Worker\"` when you try to invoke it from a Workflow.\n\n```ts\nimport { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';\nimport * as activities from './activities';\n\n// ...\nconst worker = await Worker.create({\n  // ...\n  activities,\n});\n```\n\n:::tip Sticky Activities\n\n**Any matching Worker can pick up your Activity**, meaning your Activities are not guaranteed to execute on the same machine if you have a fleet of Workers.\nYou can route tasks to specific machines with the [Sticky Queues pattern](/typescript/workers#example-sticky-queues).\n\n:::\n\nAdvanced users can also register [Activity Interceptors](/typescript/interceptors) here.\nFor more on Activity and Workflow registration, see [the Worker docs](/typescript/workers) for more details.\n\n### Using pure ESM Node Modules\n\nThe JavaScript ecosystem is increasingly moving towards publishing ES Modules over CommonJS, for example `node-fetch@3` is ESM while `node-fetch@2` is CJS.\n\n**If you are importing a pure ESM dependency, see our [fetch ESM](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/fetch-esm) sample** for necessary config changes you will need:\n\n- `package.json` must have `\"type\": \"module\"` attribute\n- `tsconfig.json` should output in `esnext` format\n- Imports [must](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_mandatory_file_extensions) include the `.js` file extension\n\n## Important Design Patterns\n\nHere are some important (and frequently asked) patterns for using our Activities APIs, to illustrate common needs and usecases.\n\n### Sharing dependencies in Activity functions (Dependency Injection)\n\nBecause Activities are \"just\" functions, you can also create functions that create Activities.\nThis is a helpful pattern for using closures to:\n\n- store expensive dependencies for sharing, such as database connections\n- injecting secret keys (such as environment variables) from the Worker to the Activity\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-with-deps-->\n\n[activities-dependency-injection/src/activities.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/activities-dependency-injection/src/activities.ts)\n\n```ts\nexport interface DB {\n  get(key: string): Promise<string>;\n}\n\nexport const createActivities = (db: DB) => ({\n  async greet(msg: string): Promise<string> {\n    const name = await db.get('name'); // simulate read from db\n    return `${msg}: ${name}`;\n  },\n  async greet_es(mensaje: string): Promise<string> {\n    const name = await db.get('name'); // simulate read from db\n    return `${mensaje}: ${name}`;\n  },\n});\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n<details>\n  <summary>See full example</summary>\n\nWhen you register these in the Worker, pass your shared dependencies accordingly:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-deps-worker {\"enable_source_link\": false}-->\n\n```ts\nimport { createActivities } from './activities';\n\nasync function run() {\n  // Mock DB connection initialization in Worker\n  const db = {\n    async get(_key: string) {\n      return 'Temporal';\n    },\n  };\n\n  const worker = await Worker.create({\n    taskQueue: 'dependency-injection',\n    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),\n    activities: createActivities(db),\n  });\n\n  await worker.run();\n}\n\nrun().catch((err) => {\n  console.error(err);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nSince Activities are always referenced by name, inside the Workflow they can be proxied as normal, though the types need some adjustment:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-deps-workflow-->\n\n[activities-dependency-injection/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/activities-dependency-injection/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nimport type { createActivities } from './activities';\n\n// Note usage of ReturnType<> generic since createActivities is a factory function\nconst { greet, greet_es } = proxyActivities<\n  ReturnType<typeof createActivities>\n>({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '30 seconds',\n});\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n</details>\n\n### Importing multiple Activities at once\n\nYou may proxy multiple Activities from the same `proxyActivities` call if you want them to share the same timeouts/retries/options:\n\n```ts\nexport async function Workflow(name: string): Promise<string> {\n  // destructuring multiple activities with the same options\n  const { act1, act2, act3 } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>();\n  /* activityOptions */\n  await act1();\n  await Promise.all([act2, act3]);\n}\n```\n\n### Dynamically referencing Activities\n\nSince, under the hood, Activities are only referenced by their string name, you can reference them dynamically if needed:\n\n```js\nexport async function DynamicWorkflow(activityName, ...args) {\n  const acts = proxyActivities(/* activityOptions */);\n\n  // these are equivalent\n  await acts.activity1();\n  await acts['activity1']();\n\n  // dynamic reference to activities using activityName\n  let result = await acts[activityName](...args);\n}\n```\n\nType safety is still supported here, but you are encouraged to validate and handle mismatches in Activity names. An invalid Activity name will lead to a `NotFoundError` with a message that looks like:\n\n```\nApplicationFailure: Activity function actC is not registered on this Worker, available activities: [\"actA\", \"actB\"]\n```\n\n## Activity Context utilities\n\nTemporal SDK also exports a [`Context`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Context/) class with useful features for activities: `import { Context } from '@temporalio/activity'`\n\n| Activity Context properties            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `Context.current().cancellationSignal` | An `AbortSignal` which can be used to cancel requests on Activity cancellation. Typically used by the `fetch` and `child_process` libraries but is supported by a few other libraries as well. |\n| `Context.current().cancelled`          | Await this promise in an Activity to get notified of cancellation. This promise will never be resolved; it will only be rejected with a `CancelledFailure`.                                    |\n| `Context.current().heartbeat()`        | Send a Heartbeat from an Activity.                                                                                                                                                             |\n| `Context.current().info`               | Holds [information](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/activity.Info) about the current executing Activity                                                                          |\n| `Context.current().sleep()`            | Helper function for sleeping in an Activity - resolves when deadline is reached or rejects when the Context is cancelled. Prefer this to `setTimeout`.                                         |\n\n### Heartbeating\n\nLong running activities should Heartbeat their progress back to the Workflow for earlier detection of stalled activities (with Heartbeat timeouts) and resuming stalled activities from checkpoints (with Heartbeat details).\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhat activities should Heartbeat?\n</summary>\n\nHeartbeating is best thought about not in terms of time, but in terms of \"How do you know you are making progress\"? If an operation is so short that it doesn't make any sense to say \"I am still working on this\", then don't heartbeat. Vice versa for longer operations.\n\n- If your underlying task can report definite progress, that is ideal.\n  - However, do note that your Workflow cannot read this progress information while the Activity is still executing (or it would have to store it in Event History). You may report progress to external sources if you need it exposed to the user.\n- Even without a \"progress you may get something useful from just verifying that the Worker processing your Activity is at the very least \"still alive\" (has not run out of memory or silently crashed).\n\nSuitable for Heartbeating:\n\n- Read a large file from S3\n- Run a ML training job on some local GPUs\n\nNot suitable for Heartbeating:\n\n- Reading a small file from disk\n- Making a quick API call\n\n</details>\n\n```ts\n// activity implementation\nexport async function example(sleepIntervalMs = 1000): Promise<void> {\n  for (let progress = 1; progress <= 1000; ++progress) {\n    await Context.current().sleep(sleepIntervalMs);\n    Context.current().heartbeat();\n  }\n}\n\n// workflow code calling activity\nconst { example } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '1 hour',\n  heartbeatTimeout: '10s',\n});\n```\n\nWithout Heartbeating, if your activity `StartToCloseTimeout` is 1 hour and the activity stalled, or activity worker died, Temporal would have to wait out the 1 hour before retrying.\nBut if you used the Heartbeat API, set a `heartbeatTimeout` for 10 seconds, the absence of Heartbeats in the `heartbeatTimeout` window would inform the Server that the Activity has stalled and should be retried right away rather than at the end of the `StartToCloseTimeout`.\n\nThe second major benefit of Heartbeating is being able to resume from failure by check pointing data as `heartbeatDetails`.\nExtending the example above:\n\n```ts\nexport async function example(sleepIntervalMs = 1000): Promise<void> {\n  const startingPoint = Context.current().info.heartbeatDetails || 1; // allow for resuming from heartbeat\n  for (let progress = startingPoint; progress <= 100; ++progress) {\n    await Context.current().sleep(sleepIntervalMs);\n    Context.current().heartbeat(progress);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, if the Activity Worker experiences a `heartbeatTimeout`, when a retry happens, it will pick up where the previous attempt left off.\n\n### Activity Cancellation\n\nActivity Cancellation is an optional capability that lets you do graceful cleanup if it's originating Workflow is canceled. There are some additional usage notes:\n\n- Activities may be cancelled only if they emit heartbeats.\n- A Workflow can request to cancel an Activity by cancelling its containing [cancellation scope](/typescript/cancellation-scopes).\n\nThere are 3 ways to handle Activity cancellation:\n\n1. Await on [`Context.current().cancelled`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Context#cancelled)\n2. Catch a [`CancelledFailure`](/typescript/handling-failure/) while awaiting \"cancellation-aware\" APIs like `Context.current().sleep`. Errors can be validated with the `isCancellation(err)` utility function (see example below)\n3. Pass the context's abort Signal at [`Context.current().cancellationSignal`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Context#cancelled) to a library that supports it like `fetch`\n\n[`heartbeat()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Context/#heartbeat) in the TypeScript SDK is a background operation and does not propagate errors to the caller, such as when the scheduling Workflow has already completed or the Activity has been closed by the Server (due to timeout for instance). These errors are translated into cancellation and can be handled using the methods above.\n\n#### Example: Activity that fakes progress and can be cancelled\n\nThe [`sleep`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Context#sleep) method exposed in `Context.current()` is comparable to a standard `sleep` function: `new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, sleepMS));` except that it also rejects if the Activity is cancelled.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-fake-progress-->\n\n[activities-cancellation-heartbeating/src/activities.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/activities-cancellation-heartbeating/src/activities.ts)\n\n```ts\nimport { CancelledFailure, Context } from '@temporalio/activity';\n\nexport async function fakeProgress(sleepIntervalMs = 1000): Promise<void> {\n  try {\n    // allow for resuming from heartbeat\n    const startingPoint = Context.current().info.heartbeatDetails || 1;\n    console.log('Starting activity at progress:', startingPoint);\n    for (let progress = startingPoint; progress <= 100; ++progress) {\n      // simple utility to sleep in activity for given interval or throw if Activity is cancelled\n      // don't confuse with Workflow.sleep which is only used in Workflow functions!\n      console.log('Progress:', progress);\n      await Context.current().sleep(sleepIntervalMs);\n      Context.current().heartbeat(progress);\n    }\n  } catch (err) {\n    if (err instanceof CancelledFailure) {\n      console.log('Fake progress activity cancelled', err.message);\n      // Cleanup\n    }\n    throw err;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n#### Example: Activity that makes a cancellable HTTP request with cancellationSignal\n\nThe [`Context.current().cancellationSignal`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Context#cancellationsignal) returns an `AbortSignal` that is typically used by the `node_fetch` and `child_process` libraries but is supported by a few other libraries as well as the Web-standard [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/signal).\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-cancellable-fetch-->\n\n[activities-examples/src/activities/cancellable-fetch.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/activities-examples/src/activities/cancellable-fetch.ts)\n\n```ts\nimport { Context } from '@temporalio/activity';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\n\nexport async function cancellableFetch(url: string): Promise<Uint8Array> {\n  const response = await fetch(url, {\n    signal: Context.current().cancellationSignal,\n  });\n  const contentLengthHeader = response.headers.get('Content-Length');\n  if (contentLengthHeader === null) {\n    throw new Error('expected Content-Length header to be set');\n  }\n  const contentLength = parseInt(contentLengthHeader);\n  let bytesRead = 0;\n  const chunks: Buffer[] = [];\n\n  for await (const chunk of response.body) {\n    if (!(chunk instanceof Buffer)) {\n      throw new TypeError('Expected Buffer');\n    }\n    bytesRead += chunk.length;\n    chunks.push(chunk);\n    Context.current().heartbeat(bytesRead / contentLength);\n  }\n  return Buffer.concat(chunks);\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n## Advanced Features\n\nThese are Activity features that most users will not need, but are available for advanced users.\nPlease get in touch with us if you find the need for them.\n\n### Activity Interceptors\n\nInterceptors are a mechanism for users to modify inbound and outbound SDK calls. Interceptors are commonly used to add tracing and authorization to the scheduling and execution of Workflows and Activities, but you can also use them to run code after an Activity failure (and before the next retry). See the [Interceptors docs](/typescript/interceptors) and the [SDK API Reference](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.ActivityInboundCallsInterceptor) for more information.\n\n### Async Activity Completion\n\nNormally, an Activity is started and ended in the same Worker, for example a short HTTP call.\nHowever, sometimes you may want to record an Activity completion in a different process than when you started it.\n\n> If you are modeling human actions, we recommend using Signals rather than Async Activity Completion.\n> This is because Activities only have one timeout and, if your Activity is split into two steps, one for kicking off the process (for example, storing information in the data base), and one for human based resolution, it's best to use the timeout to detect failure in the former, so it can be retried by the system.\n\nAsync Activity completion is done through a two-step process:\n\n- Throw a `CompleteAsyncError` from an Activity\n- Use a `AsyncCompletionClient` to mark it as completed, failed, or more.\n\nYou can [read the tests](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/7d47f501cb56cced27118b5f0abb320cc0ba03ef/packages/test/src/test-async-completion.ts#L40-L98) for more information.\n\n### Local Activities (experimental)\n\nTemporal has an optimization feature called Local Activities.\n\nThis document is still a WIP. For more details, see [What is a Local Activity?](/concepts/what-is-a-local-activity/)\n\nTo call Local Activities in TS, use [`proxyLocalActivities`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#proxylocalactivities).\n\n```ts\nimport * as workflow from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nconst { getEnvVar } = workflow.proxyLocalActivities({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '2 seconds',\n});\n\nexport async function yourWorkflow(): Promise<void> {\n  const someSetting = await getEnvVar('SOME_SETTING');\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nLocal Activities must be registered with the Worker the same way non-local Activities are.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"api-reference-typescript.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/api-reference-typescript.md","id":"typescript/api-reference-typescript","title":"API

Cancellation Scopes\n\nIn the TypeScript SDK, Workflows are represented internally by a tree of **Cancellation Scopes**, each with cancellation behaviors you can specify.\nEverything runs in the \"root\" scope by default.\n\nScopes are created using the [`CancellationScope`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope) constructor, or one of 3 static helpers:\n\n- [`cancellable(fn)`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope#cancellable-1): children are automatically cancelled when their containing scope is cancelled.\n  - Equivalent to `new CancellationScope().run(fn)`.\n- [`nonCancellable(fn)`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope#noncancellable): prevents cancellation from propagating to children.\n  - Equivalent to `new CancellationScope({ cancellable: false }).run(fn)`.\n- [`withTimeout(timeoutMs, fn)`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope#withtimeout): if timeout triggers before `fn` resolves the scope will be cancelled, triggering cancellation of enclosed operations, such as activities and timers.\n  - Equivalent to `new CancellationScope({ cancellable: true, timeout: timeoutMs }).run(fn)`.\n\nCancellations are applied to _cancellation scopes_, which can encompass an entire Workflow or just part of one.\nScopes can be nested, and cancellation propagates from outer scopes to inner ones.\nA Workflow's `main` function runs in the outermost scope.\nCancellations are handled by catching `CancelledFailure`s thrown by _cancellable operations_ (see below).\n\n`CancellationScope.run()` and the static helpers mentioned above all return native JS Promises, so you can use the familiar Promise APIs like `Promise.all` and `Promise.race` to model your async logic.\nOther APIs you can use:\n\n- `CancellationScope.current()`: get the current scope\n- `scope.cancel()`: cancel all operations inside a `scope`\n- `scope.run(fn)`: run an async function within a `scope`, returns the result of `fn`\n- `scope.cancelRequested`: a promise that resolves when a scope cancellation is requested, e.g. when Workflow code calls `cancel()` or the entire Workflow is cancelled by an external client.\n\nWhen a `CancellationScope` is cancelled, it propagates cancellation in any child scopes and of any _cancellable operations_ created within it, such as:\n\n- Activities\n- Timers (created with the [`sleep`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#sleep) function)\n- [`Trigger`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.Trigger)s\n\n### [CancelledFailure](/typescript/handling-failure/#cancelledfailure)\n\n`Timer`s and `Trigger`s throw `CancelledFailure` when cancelled while Activities and Child Workflows throw `ActivityFailure` and `ChildWorkflowFailure` with cause set to `CancelledFailure`.\nOne exception is when an Activity or Child Workflow is scheduled in an already cancelled scope (or workflow) in which case they'll propagate the `CancelledFailure` that was thrown to cancel the scope.\n\nIn order to simplify checking for cancellation, use the [`isCancellation(err)`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#iscancellation) function.\n\n## Internal cancellation example\n\n<!--SNIPSTART

Just remember you will need to configure your Connection and Namespace when [deploying to production](/typescript/security#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls).\n\n## Start a Workflow Execution\n\nWhen you have a Workflow Client, you can schedule the start of a Workflow with `client.start`, specifying `workflowId`, `taskQueue`, and `args` and returning a Workflow Handle (see below) immediately after the Server acknowledges receipt.\n\n```ts\n// // STEP ONE: client.start\n// Option 1: Specifying args and workflowId\nconst handle = await client.start(example, {\n  workflowId: 'business-meaningful-id',\n  taskQueue: 'tutorial',\n  args: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], // this is typechecked against workflowFn's args\n});\n\n// Option 2: Just using string name; no need to import Workflow, but no type inference\nimport { WorkflowStartOptions } from '@temporalio/client';\ntype WFType = (key: number) => Promise<string>; // arg types intentionally wrong to prove a point\nconst handle = await client.start<string>('example', {\n  workflowId: 'business-meaningful-id',\n  taskQueue: 'tutorial',\n  args: [123], // typechecked, but actually wrong at runtime because wrong type signature\n} as WorkflowStartOptions<WFType>);\n\n// // STEP TWO: client.getHandle\n// Continue in a different process (such as a serverless function)\nconst handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);\nconst result = await handle.result(); // wait for Workflow to complete and get result. See below for other Handle APIs\n\n// alternative combination of STEP ONE + TWO\nconst result = await client.execute(example /*...*/); // start and immediately wait for Workflow to complete and get result\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Note: Scheduling is not the same as Starting Workflows\n</summary>\n\nCalling `client.start` (or `client.execute`) merely sends a Command to Temporal Server to schedule a new Workflow Execution on the specified Task Queue; it does not actually start until a Worker (that has a matching Workflow Type) polling that Task Queue picks it up.\n\nYou can test this by executing a Workflow Client command without a matching Worker.\nTemporal Server records the command in Event History but does not make progress with the Workflow Execution until a Worker starts polling with a matching Task Queue and Workflow Definition.\n\nThis queuing mechanic makes your application tolerant to outages and horizontally scalable, but can be confusing to newcomers if they expect that calling `client.execute(YourWorkflow)` directly executes the Workflow code on the same machine as the Client.\n\n</details>\n\n### Workflow Options\n\nA brief guide to the [WorkflowOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowOptions) available to you:\n\n- `workflowId`, `taskQueue`, and `args` (if required) are the main ones you will regularly use\n- Optional features:\n  - `memo` (simple annotation of Workflows)\n  - `searchAttributes` (see [Search Attributes](/typescript/search-attributes))\n  - `cronSchedule` (see important notes in [Cron Workflows](#scheduling-cron-workflows) section below)\n- Advanced features you probably won't need: `followRuns` and `workflowIdReusePolicy`.\n\n:::caution\n\nWorkflow-level Retries and Timeouts are not recommended.\n\nYou will see that there are `workflowRunTimeout`, `workflowExecutionTimeout`, `workflowTaskTimeout`, and `retryPolicy` options in [WorkflowOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowOptions).\nWe discourage using them unless you know what you are doing.\nDo not rely on Workflows to timeout or fail - you probably want to push this logic down to an Activity instead.\n\n:::\n\n## Workflow Handle APIs\n\n**Workflow Handles** are returned after you start a Workflow (or retrieve an existing one with `client.getHandle`) and are bound to a single Workflow instance. They represent already-started Workflow Executions, and let you `signal`, `query`, `describe`, `cancel`, or `terminate` their instance:\n\n```ts\n// Get a handle if you don't already have it\nconst handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);\n\n// Handle API quick examples\nawait handle.cancel(); // cancel with cleanup\nawait handle.terminate(); // kill immediately\nconst WFdescription = await handle.describe(); // get Workflow Execution internal info\nawait handle.signal<Args>(mySignal, ...args); // see Signal docs\nconst queryResult = await handle.query<ReturnType, Args>(myQuery, ...args); // see Query docs\nconst result = await handle.result(); // block until the workflow completes and/or get return value\nconst result = await client.execute(example /*...*/); // Alternative API for starting and immediately waiting for Workflow completion\n```\n\nThe [Workflow Handle APIs](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowHandle) let you externally control your Workflow:\n\n| Handle API            | Description                                                                                                                               |\n| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `client`              | Readonly accessor to the underlying Workflow Client.                                                                                      |\n| `workflowId`          | The `workflowId` of the current Workflow.                                                                                                 |\n| `firstExecutionRunId` | The `runId` of the initial run of the bound Workflow (available on handles created with `start`).                                         |\n| `signaledRunId`       | The `runId` of the signalled run of the bound Workflow (available on handles created with `startWithStart`).                              |\n| `query()`             | Call to query a Workflow after it's been started even if it has already completed. `const value = await handle.query(getValue, ...args);` |\n| `signal()`            | Call to signal a _running_ Workflow. `await handle.signal(increment, ...args);`                                                           |\n| `cancel()`            | Cancels a running Workflow.                                                                                                               |\n| `terminate()`         | Terminates a running Workflow.                                                                                                            |\n| `describe()`          | Describes the current Workflow Execution.                                                                                                 |\n| `result()`            | Promise that resolves when Workflow Execution completes.                                                                                  |\n\nThe following covers how to use many of these APIs, you will want to be fluent with them as they cover the basics of Workflow manipulation.\n\n### Get a Workflow's result\n\nWorkflow functions may or may not return a result when they complete.\n\nIf you started a Workflow with `handle.start`, you can choose to wait for the result anytime with `handle.result()`.\n\n```ts\nconst handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);\nconst result = await handle.result(); // block until the workflow completes, if you wish\n```\n\nUsing a Workflow Handle isn't necessary with `client.execute` by definition.\n\n- **Don't forget to handle errors here.**\n  If you call `result()` on a Workflow that prematurely ended for some reason, it throws a [WorkflowFailedError](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowFailedError) error that reflects that reason.\n\n  ```ts\n  const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);\n  try {\n    const result = await handle.result(); // block until the workflow completes, if you wish\n  } catch (err) {\n    if (err instanceof WorkflowFailedError) {\n      throw new Error('Temporal workflow failed: ' + workflowId, {\n        cause: err,\n      });\n    } else {\n      throw new Error('error from Temporal workflow ' + workflowId, {\n        cause: err,\n      });\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- You can also specify a `runId`, but you will almost never need it, because most people only want the results of the latest run (a Workflow may run multiple times if failed or continued as new).\n\n### Cancel a Workflow\n\nTo cancel a Workflow Execution, call the [`handle.cancel()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowHandle#cancel) method on a Workflow Handle.\n\n```ts\n// Start the Workflow without waiting its completion\nawait handle.start(args);\n// ... Later on, cancel the workflow\nawait handle.cancel();\n```\n\nWith `handle.cancel()`, Timers and Child Workflows have the opportunity to execute cleanup code.\nIf you wish to skip that, you can also [`handle.terminate()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowHandle#terminate) forcefully.\n\nTemporal gives you fine grained control over what happens when you cancel a workflow. See our docs on [Cancellation Scopes](/typescript/cancellation-scopes) for details and examples.\n\n## Scheduling Cron Workflows\n\nYou can set each Workflow to repeat on a schedule with the `cronSchedule` option:\n\n```ts\nconst handle = await client.start(scheduledWorkflow, {\n  workflowId: 'business-meaningful-id',\n  taskQueue: 'tutorial',\n  cronSchedule: '* * * * *', // start every minute\n});\n```\n\n:::info Should I use Cron Workflows or Timers?\n\nThis section is specifically about <preview page={WhatIsATemporalCronJob}>Temporal Cron Jobs</preview>, which are Workflows that have the `cronSchedule` option set in Temporal.\nBecause Temporal Workflows have [Timers](/typescript/workflows#timers), can loop indefinitely, and can spawn [Child Workflows](/typescript/workflows#child-workflows), it is natural to ask when to use which.\n\nCron Workflows are rigid and come with a lot of caveats.\nThey are a great choice if you have Workflows that need to run as rigidly as the native Linux `cron` utility (except distributed and fault tolerant).\nHowever, if you have any advanced needs (including needing overlaps, or canceling individual executions without affecting the overall schedule), use Timers.\n\n:::\n\nYou can set each Workflow to repeat on a schedule with the `cronSchedule` option:\n\n```ts\nconst handle = await client.start(scheduledWorkflow, {\n  taskQueue: 'test',\n  cronSchedule: '* * * * *', // start every minute\n});\n```\n\nFor more information, see the Typescript SDK [`workflowOptions` source code](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowOptions/#cronschedule).\n\n## Note: Child Workflows and External Workflows\n\nYou can start Child Workflows only from within another Workflow, and not from a Client.\n\n**Hence the main Child Workflows documentation is on the [Workflow APIs](/typescript/workflows#child-workflows) page.**\n\nA lot of the same concepts about starting, executing, and signaling Workflow Executions apply:\n\n```ts\n// inside Workflow code\nimport { startChild } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport async function example(WFname: string, args: string[]): Promise<string> {\n  const childHandle = await startChild(WFname, {\n    // workflowId is optional only for child workflows\n    // task queue and other options inherited from parent, can override\n    args,\n  });\n  const result = await childHandle.result();\n  // // equivalent to\n  // const result = await executeChild(WFname, /* ... */)\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nYou should use [cancellationScopes](/typescript/cancellation-scopes) if you need to cancel Child Workflows.\n\nThe same concept of \"Workflow Handles\" applies to retrieving handles for Child and External Workflows—as long as you have the Workflow Id:\n\n```ts\n// inside Workflow code\nimport { getExternalWorkflowHandle } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport async function CancelExternalWorkflow(wfId: string): void {\n  const extHandle = getExternalWorkflowHandle(wfId);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nAgain, see [Workflows in TypeScript](/typescript/workflows#external-workflows) for full details.\n\n## Advanced: Making raw gRPC calls\n\nUnder the hood of a `WorkflowClient`, the `Connection` is actually powered by a `WorkflowService` driver that makes the raw gRPC calls to Temporal Server.\nThis Service is capable of making a wider range of introspection calls.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-grpc-call-basic-->\n\n[grpc-calls/src/client.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/grpc-calls/src/client.ts)\n\n```ts\nconst connection = await Connection.connect();\n\n// // normal way of starting a Workflow, with a Client\n// const client = new Client({ connection });\n// await client.workflow.start(/* etc */);\n\nconst payload = defaultPayloadConverter.toPayload('Temporal');\nif (payload == null) {\n  // This should not happen with standard inputs and the defaultPayloadConverter.\n  throw new TypeError('Could not convert string to payload');\n}\n// equivalent grpc call to client.start()\nawait connection.workflowService.startWorkflowExecution({\n  namespace: 'default',\n  workflowId,\n  requestId,\n  taskQueue: { name: 'grpc-calls' },\n  workflowType: { name: 'example' },\n  input: {\n    // Client passes data through Data Converter to convert to Payloads; with gRPC calls have to do it yourself\n    // import { defaultPayloadConverter, toPayloads } from '@temporalio/common';\n    payloads: [payload],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nUsing gRPC calls is often the only way to access some of the more

[DataConverter](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.DataConverter/)\n\nTo send values that are not [JSON-serializable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types) like `BigInt`s or

[`PayloadConverter`](#payloadconverter): sync methods that sometimes run inside the Workflow isolate (and are thus [limited](/typescript/determinism#imports-in-workflow-code))\n- [`PayloadCodec`](#payloadcodec): async methods that are run outside the isolate\n\n```ts\ninterface DataConverter {\n  payloadConverterPath?: string;\n  payloadCodecs?: PayloadCodec[];\n}\n```\n\n###

[\"Sticky\" optimizations exist to make this faster for common situations](/concepts/what-is-a-sticky-execution).\n  - If the execution logic has changed enough to affect Event History, you need to [patch new code](/typescript/patching).\n- The Workflow runtime is completely deterministic: functions like `Math.random`, `Date`, and `setTimeout` are replaced by deterministic versions, and the only way for a Workflow to interact with the world is via Activities.\n- When an Activity completes, its result is stored in the Workflow history to be replayed in case a Workflow is restored.\n\nThe SDK does not throw an exception to suspend execution (like React Suspense), nor does it use VM snapshotting (yet), nor does it do any AST magic.\n\n### Imports in Workflow code\n\nWorkflow code is bundled on Worker creation using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), you may import any JS package, **as long as it doesn't reference Node or DOM APIs**.\n\n### Sources of non-determinism\n\n- `Math.random` - replaced by the runtime\n- `uuid4` - provided by the runtime\n- `Date` - replaced by the runtime\n  - `new Date()` and `Date.now()` are both set on the first invocation of the Workflow Task\n- `WeakRef | FinalizationRegistry` - cannot be used, as GC is non-deterministic and the Workflow code may observe its effect; deleted by the runtime\n- Timers - `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` are replaced by the runtime.\n  - We recommend you use the `@temporal/workflow` package's exported `sleep` function because it plays well with [cancellation scopes](/typescript/cancellation-scopes): `import { sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow'`\n- Activities - use to run non-deterministic code; results are replayed from history\n- Node built ins:\n  - `process` global\n  - `path` module, `fs` module\n\n### Deterministic examples\n\nHow `Date` is deterministic:\n\n```js\nimport { sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\n// this prints the *exact* same timestamp repeatedly\nfor (let x = 0; x < 10; ++x) {\n  console.log(Date.now());\n}\n\n// this prints timestamps increasing roughly 1s each iteration\nfor (let x = 0; x < 10; ++x) {\n  await sleep('1 second');\n  console.log(Date.now());\n}\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"failures.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/failures.md","id":"typescript/handling-failure","title":"Handling Failures in TypeScript","description":"Failures in Temporal are structured and typed.

They represent a variety of failure scenarios across the different SDKs and the server.\n\nIn the TypeScript SDK, failures are represented by [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) classes. They can be caught in both Workflow code and non-Workflow code.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nFailures are serializable over the network and chainable to enable root-cause analysis anywhere in the failure chain.\n</summary>\n\nIf, for example, a TypeScript Workflow starts a Java Child Workflow which calls an Activity in Golang and that activity fails, the TypeScript Workflow will throw a `ChildWorkflowFailure` with `cause` set to an `ActivityFailure`, and the `ActivityFailure`'s `cause` is set to `ApplicationFailure`, which represents the error that occurred in the Golang Activity.\n\n<!--TODO: use snipsync-->\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  ActivityFailure,\n  ApplicationFailure,\n  ChildWorkflowFailure,\n} from '@temporalio/common';\nimport { executeChild } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\n// Define the TypeScript version of the Java Workflow interface\n// to get a type safe child WorkflowHandle\nexport type JavaWorkflow = () => Promise<void>;\n\nasync function yourWorkflow(): Promise<void> {\n  try {\n    await executeChild<JavaWorkflow>('RunAnActivityWorkflow');\n  } catch (err) {\n    if (\n      err instanceof ChildWorkflowFailure\n      && err.cause instanceof ActivityFailure\n      && err.cause.cause instanceof ApplicationFailure\n    ) {\n      console.log(\n        'Child workflow failure root cause was a failed activity',\n        err.cause.cause.message,\n      );\n    }\n    throw err;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\nOutside of Workflow code, failure classes are attached to the `cause` of [`WorkflowFailedError`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowFailedError), which is thrown when executing a Workflow with a [`WorkflowClient`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowClient/) or [`WorkflowHandle`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowHandle/).\n\n## Failures and retries\n\nActivities and Workflows scheduled in the system have a configurable [Retry Policy](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/proto.temporal.api.common.v1.IRetryPolicy), which many contain an array of `nonRetryableErrorTypes`.\n\nWhen a Workflow or Activity fails with an unhandled error, Temporal checks if the error name is present in the array of `nonRetryableErrorTypes` and stops retrying if there's a match.\n\nWorkflows and Activities may also throw [`ApplicationFailure.nonRetryable`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.ApplicationFailure#nonretryable-1) to expressly prevent retries.\n\nPropagated Activity and Child Workflow failures are considered retryable and will be retried according to the parent Workflow's Retry Policy.\n\nThe expected behavior is:\n\n- Non retryable application failure -> fails the Workflow and cannot be retried\n- Retryable application failure -> fails the Workflow and can be retried according to the Retry Policy\n- Other TemporalFailures -> same as retryable application failure\n- Any other error -> fails the Workflow Task and can be retried\n\n> Note: Before TypeScript SDK v0.17.0, throwing any error in a Workflow would cause the Workflow Execution to fail - in other words, all errors were Application Failures. The semantics were corrected in v0.17.\n\n### Pattern: Wrapping Errors with Interceptors\n\nTo make other error types fail the workflow, use the `WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor` methods (`execute` and `handleSignal`) to catch errors thrown from the Workflow and convert them to `ApplicationFailures`, e.g:\n\n```ts\nasync function wrapError<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {\n  try {\n    return await fn();\n  } catch (err) {\n    if (err instanceof MySpecialRetryableError) {\n      throw ApplicationFailure.retryable(\n        err.message,\n        'MySpecialRetryableError',\n      ); // can also make this nonRetryable if that is the intent. remember to change the error name.\n    }\n    throw err;\n  }\n}\n\nclass WorkflowErrorInterceptor implements WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor {\n  async execute(\n    input: WorkflowExecuteInput,\n    next: Next<WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor, 'execute'>,\n  ): Promise<unknown> {\n    return await wrapError(() => next(input));\n  }\n\n  async handleSignal(\n    input: SignalInput,\n    next: Next<WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor, 'handleSignal'>,\n  ): Promise<void> {\n    return await wrapError(() => next(input));\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## `isCancellation` utility\n\nFailures are also used to represent [cancellation](/typescript/cancellation-scopes#cancelledfailure) of Activities and Child Workflows.\n\nAs explained above, cancellation might not be the immediate cause of failure — it might happen further down the chain. Use the [`isCancellation`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#iscancellation) helper function to inspect the chain recursively and look for a `CancelledFailure`.\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  CancellationScope,\n  isCancellation,\n  proxyActivities,\n} from '@temporalio/workflow';\nimport * as activities from '../activities';\n\nexport function yourWorkflow(\n  urls: string[],\n  timeoutMs: number,\n): Promise<any[]> {\n  const { httpGetJSON } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n    scheduleToCloseTimeout: timeoutMs,\n  });\n\n  try {\n    return await CancellationScope.withTimeout(\n      timeoutMs,\n      () => Promise.all(urls.map((url) => httpGetJSON(url))),\n    );\n  } catch (err) {\n    if (isCancellation(err)) {\n      console.log('Deadline exceeded while waiting for activities to complete');\n    }\n    throw err;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Failure classes reference\n\n### [TemporalFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.TemporalFailure)\n\nThe base class of all other failure classes in the SDK.\n\n### [ApplicationFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.ApplicationFailure)\n\n`ApplicationFailure` is used to communicate application-specific failures between Workflows and Activities.\n\nThrow this exception to have full control over type and details of the exception delivered to the caller Workflow or client.\n\nAny unhandled exception that doesn't extend [`TemporalFailure`](#temporalfailure) is converted to an instance of `ApplicationFailure` before being returned to a caller.\n\n### [CancelledFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.CancelledFailure)\n\n`CancelledFailure` is thrown in a Workflow when a cancellation scope or the entire Workflow has been cancelled or set as the cause for when a Child Workflow or Activity has been cancelled.\n\nIn an Activity, it may be thrown if the Activity was requested to be cancelled.

Not the path.\n- Workflow bundle:\n- Either specify a `workflowsPath` to your `workflows.ts` file to pass to Webpack, e.g., `require.resolve('./workflows')`. Workflows will be bundled with their dependencies.\n- Or pass a prebuilt bundle to `workflowBundle` instead if you prefer to handle the bundling yourself.\n\n**Additional Worker Options**\n\nThis is a selected subset of options you are likely to use.

Similar to Activities, they are declared in the Worker and then proxied in Workflow code, and it helps to share types between both.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Comparing Sinks, Activities and

Sink functions don't return any value back to the Workflow and cannot not be awaited.\n- Sink calls are not recorded in Workflow histories (no timeouts or retries).\n- Sink functions are _always_ run on the same Worker that runs the Workflow they are called from.\n\n</details>\n\n**Declaring the Sink Interface**\n\nExplicitly declaring a Sink's interface is optional, but is useful for ensuring type safety in subsequent steps:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART

[InjectedSinkFunction](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.InjectedSinkFunction) interface:\n\n- **Injected WorkflowInfo argument**: The first argument of a Sink function implementation is a [`workflowInfo` object](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowInfo/) that contains useful metadata.\n- **Limited arguments types**: The remaining Sink function arguments are copied between the sandbox and the Node.js environment using the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm).\n- **No return value**: To prevent breaking determinism, Sink functions cannot return values to the Workflow.\n\n**Advanced: Performance considerations and non-blocking Sinks**\n\nThe injected sink function contributes to the overall Workflow Task processing duration.\n\n- If you have a long-running sink function, such as one that tries to communicate with external services, you might start seeing Workflow Task timeouts.\n- The effect is multiplied when using `callDuringReplay: true` and replaying long Workflow histories because the Workflow Task timer starts when the first history page is delivered to the

Activities are directly required and run by Workers in the Node.js environment.\n\nWorkers are flexible. You can host any or all of your Workflows and Activities on a Worker, and you can host multiple Workers on a single machine.\n\nThere are three main things the Worker needs:\n\n- `taskQueue`: the Task Queue to poll. This is the only required argument.\n- `activities`: Optional. Imported and supplied directly to the Worker.\n- Workflow bundle, specify one of the following options:\n  - a `workflowsPath` to your `workflows.ts` file to pass to Webpack. For example, `require.resolve('./workflows')`. Workflows will be bundled with their dependencies.\n  - Or pass a prebuilt bundle to `workflowBundle`, if you prefer to handle the bundling yourself.\n\n```ts\nimport { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';\nimport * as activities from './activities';\n\nasync function run() {\n  // Step 1: Register Workflows and Activities with the Worker and connect to\n  // the Temporal server.\n  const worker = await Worker.create({\n    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),\n    activities,\n    taskQueue: 'hello-world',\n  });\n  // Worker connects to localhost by default and uses console.error for logging.\n  // Customize the Worker by passing more options to create():\n  // https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker\n  // If you need to configure server connection parameters, see docs:\n  // /typescript/security#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls\n\n  // Step 2: Start accepting tasks on the `tutorial` queue\n  await worker.run();\n}\n\nrun().catch((err) => {\n  console.error(err);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n```\n\n`taskQueue` is the only required option; however, use `workflowsPath` and `activities` to register Workflows and Activities with the Worker.\n\nWhen scheduling a Workflow, a `taskQueue` must be specified.\n\n```ts\nimport { Connection, WorkflowClient } from '@temporalio/client';\n// This is the code that is used to start a workflow.\nconst connection = await Connection.create();\nconst client = new WorkflowClient({ connection });\nconst result = await client.execute(yourWorkflow, {\n  // required\n  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',\n  // required\n  workflowId: 'your-workflow-id',\n});\n```\n\nWhen creating a Worker, you must pass the `taskQueue` option to the `Worker.create()` function.\n\n```ts\nconst worker = await Worker.create({\n  // imported elsewhere\n  activities,\n  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',\n});\n```\n\nOptionally, in Workflow code, when calling an Activity, you can specify the Task Queue by passing the `taskQueue` option to `proxyActivities()`, `startChild()`, or `executeChild()`. If you do not specify a `taskQueue`, then the TypeScript SDK places Activity and Child Workflow Tasks in the same Task Queue as the Workflow Task Queue.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-set-activity-timeouts-in-typescript.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/how-to-set-activity-timeouts-in-typescript.md","id":"typescript/how-to-set-activity-timeouts-in-typescript","title":"How to set Activity Timeouts in TypeScript","description":"Set Activity Timeouts","label":"Set Activity Timeouts","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","typescript"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nWhen you call `proxyActivities` in a Workflow Function, you can set a range of `ActivityOptions`.\n\nAvailable timeouts are:\n\n- [`scheduleToCloseTimeout`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.ActivityOptions/#scheduletoclosetimeout)\n- [`startToCloseTimeout`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.ActivityOptions/#starttoclosetimeout)\n- [`scheduleToStartTimeout`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.ActivityOptions/#scheduletostarttimeout)\n\n```typescript\n// Sample of typical options you can set\nconst { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  scheduleToCloseTimeout: '5m',\n  // startToCloseTimeout: \"30s\", // recommended\n  // scheduleToStartTimeout: \"60s\",\n\n  retry: {\n    // default retry policy if not specified\n    initialInterval: '1s',\n    backoffCoefficient: 2,\n    maximumAttempts: Infinity,\n    maximumInterval: 100 * initialInterval,\n    nonRetryableErrorTypes: [],\n  },\n});\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-set-an-activity-retry-policy-in-typescript.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/how-to-set-an-activity-retry-policy-in-typescript.md","id":"typescript/how-to-set-an-activity-retry-policy-in-typescript","title":"How to set an Activity Retry Policy in TypeScript","description":"Set an Activity Retry Policy","label":"Set an Activity Retry Policy","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTo set Activity Retry Policies in TypeScript, pass [`ActivityOptions.retry`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.ActivityOptions#retry) to [`proxyActivities`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#proxyactivities).\n\n```typescript\n// Sample of typical options you can set\nconst { yourActivity } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  // ...\n  retry: {\n    // default retry policy if not specified\n    initialInterval: '1s',\n    backoffCoefficient: 2,\n    maximumAttempts: Infinity,\n    maximumInterval: 100 * initialInterval,\n    nonRetryableErrorTypes: [],\n  },\n});\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-set-cluster-address-in-typescript.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/how-to-set-cluster-address-in-typescript.md","id":"typescript/how-to-set-cluster-address-in-typescript","title":"How to set a Cluster address in TypeScript","description":"Set Cluster address","label":"Set Cluster address","tags":["TypeScript","how-to"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nUse the [`address`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.ConnectionOptions/#address) connection option from the [`Client`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/client).\n\n```typescript\nconst connection = await Connection.connect({\n  address: 'foo.bar.tmprl.cloud',\n  // ...\n});\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-set-mtls-configuration-in-typescript.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/how-to-set-mtls-configuration-in-typescript.md","id":"typescript/how-to-set-mtls-configuration-in-typescript","title":"How to set mTLS configuration in TypeScript","description":"To set the mTLS configuration in TypeScript, use the `tls` connection option from the `Client` class to connect to a Temporal Client with mTLS.","label":"Set mTLS configuration","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","typescript"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTo set the mTLS configuration in TypeScript, use the [`tls`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.ConnectionOptions/#tls) connection option from the [`Client`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/client) class to connect to a Temporal Client with mTLS.\n\n```typescript\nconst connection = await Connection.connect({\n  address: 'foo.bar.tmprl.cloud',\n  tls: {\n    clientCertPair: {\n      crt: clientCertPath,\n      key: clientKeyPath,\n    },\n  },\n});\nconst client = new WorkflowClient({ connection, namespace: 'foo.bar' });\n```\n\n[The Hello World mTLS sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/hello-world-mtls/) demonstrates sample code used to connect to a Temporal Cloud account.\nWhen signing up to Temporal Cloud, you should receive a Namespace, a Server address, and a Client certificate and key. Use the following environment variables to set up the sample:\n\n- **TEMPORAL_ADDRESS**: looks like `foo.bar.tmprl.cloud` (NOT web.foo.bar.tmprl.cloud)\n- **TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE**: looks like `foo.bar`\n- **TEMPORAL_CLIENT_CERT_PATH**: `/tls/ca.pem` (file contents start with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----)\n- **TEMPORAL_CLIENT_KEY_PATH**: `/tls/ca.key` (file contents start with -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----)\n\nYou can leave the remaining variables, like `TEMPORAL_SERVER_NAME_OVERRIDE` and `TEMPORAL_SERVER_ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH`, blank.\nIf needed, you can customize `TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE`; the following example defaults to `hello-world-mtls`.\n\n```typescript\nexport function getEnv(): Env {\n  return {\n    // NOT web.foo.bar.tmprl.cloud\n    address: 'web.<Namespace_ID>.tmprl.cloud',\n    // as assigned\n    namespace: 'your.namespace',\n    // in project root\n    clientCertPath: 'foobar.pem',\n    clientKeyPath: 'foobar.key',\n    // just to ensure task queue is same on client and worker, totally optional\n    taskQueue: process.env.TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE || 'hello-world-mtls',\n    // not usually needed:\n    // serverNameOverride: process.env.TEMPORAL_SERVER_NAME_OVERRIDE,\n    // serverRootCACertificatePath: process.env.TEMPORAL_SERVER_ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH,\n  };\n}\n```\n\nIf you are using mTLS, it is completely up to you how to get the `clientCert` and `clientKey` pair into your code, whether it is reading from file system, secrets manager, or both. Just keep in mind that they are whitespace sensitive, and some environment variable systems have been known to cause frustration because they modify whitespace.\n\nThe following code example works for local development and for certifications hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket.\n\n```typescript\nlet serverRootCACertificate: Buffer | undefined;\nlet clientCertificate: Buffer | undefined;\nlet clientKey: Buffer | undefined;\nif (certificateS3Bucket) {\n  const s3 = new S3client({ region: certificateS3BucketRegion });\n  serverRootCACertificate = await s3.getObject({\n    bucket: certificateS3Bucket,\n    key: serverRootCACertificatePath,\n  });\n  clientCertificate = await s3.getObject({\n    bucket: certificateS3Bucket,\n    key: clientCertPath,\n  });\n  clientKey = await s3.getObject({\n    bucket: certificateS3Bucket,\n    key: clientKeyPath,\n  });\n} else {\n  serverRootCACertificate = fs.readFileSync(serverRootCACertificatePath);\n  clientCertificate = fs.readFileSync(clientCertPath);\n  clientKey = fs.readFileSync(clientKeyPath);\n}\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-set-search-attributes-from-the-client-in-typescript.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/how-to-set-search-attributes-from-the-client-in-typescript.md","id":"typescript/how-to-set-search-attributes-from-the-client-in-typescript","title":"How to set Search Attributes from the Client in TypeScript","description":"Use Search Attributes from the Client","label":"Use Search Attributes from the Client","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","typescript"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nWe can set [`WorkflowOptions.searchAttributes`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowOptions#searchattributes) during `client.start()` or `client.execute()` and read with [`handle.describe()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowHandle#describe):\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-search-attributes-client -->\n\n[search-attributes/src/client.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/search-attributes/src/client.ts)\n\n```ts\nconst handle = await client.workflow.start(example, {\n  taskQueue: 'search-attributes',\n  workflowId: 'search-attributes-example-0',\n  searchAttributes: {\n    CustomIntField: [2],\n    CustomKeywordField: ['keywordA', 'keywordB'],\n    CustomBoolField: [true],\n    CustomDatetimeField: [new Date()],\n    CustomStringField: [\n      'String field is for text.

`defineSignal()` with a name, and then attach a listener with `setHandler()`.\n\n- Handlers to take arguments, which can be used inside `setHandler()` logic.\n- Signal handlers can mutate state, Signal handlers cannot return values.\n\n**Declare your Signal as constants outside the Workflow Definition**\n\n```typescript\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport const unblockSignal = wf.defineSignal('unblock');\n let isBlocked = true;\n wf.setHandler(unblockSignal, () => void (isBlocked = false));\n console.log('Blocked');\n try {\n   await wf.condition(() => !isBlocked);\n   console.log('Unblocked');\n } catch (err) {\n   if (err instanceof wf.CancelledFailure) {\n     console.log('Cancelled');\n   }\n   throw err;\n }\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a Signal as _unblock_ and declares the variable as _isBlocked_ as true. Then the code tries to execute the condition and print _Unblocked_ to the console if it becomes unblocked. Finally, the code catches any errors, and if the error is `CancelledFailure`, then it prints `Cancelled` to the console.\n\nThis helps provide type safety, since you can export the type signature of the Signal or Query to be called on the client side.\n\n##### Declare your Signals dynamically\n\nFor more flexible usecases, you may want a dynamic Signal, such as a generated identifier. You may handle it in two ways:\n\n- avoid making it dynamic by collapsing all signals in one handler and move the identifier to the payload.\n- actually make the Signal name dynamic by inlining the Signal definition per handler.\n\n```typescript\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nwf.setHandler(`genericSignal`, (payload) => {\n  switch (payload.taskId) {\n    case taskAId:\n      // do task A things\n      break;\n    case taskBId:\n      // do task B things\n      break;\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Unexpected task.');\n  }\n});\n\n// \"inline definition\" solution\nwf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(`task-${taskAId}`), (payload) => {\n  /* do task A things */\n});\nwf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(`task-${taskBId}`), (payload) => {\n  /* do task B things */\n});\n\n// utility \"inline definition\" helper\nconst inlineSignal = (signalName, handler) =>\n  wf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(signalName), handler);\ninlineSignal(`task-${taskBId}`, (payload) => {\n  /* do task B things */\n});\n```\n\n:::note\n\nThe semantics of `defineSignal()` and `defineQuery()` is intentional, in that they return Signal/Query Definitions, not unique instances of Signals and Queries themselves.\nSignals and Queries are only instantiated in `setHandler()` and are specific to a particular Workflow Execution.\n\nThese distinctions may seem minor, but they model how Temporal works under the hood, because Signals and Queries are messages identified by _just strings_ and don't have meaning independent of the Workflow having a listener to handle them.\n\nWe named it `setHandler` instead of `subscribe` because Signals and Queries can only have one handler at a time, whereas `subscribe` could imply an observable with multiple consumers, and is a higher level construct.\n:::\n\n#### Start a Signal from the Client\n\nSending Signals requires a Workflow handle from a Temporal Client.\n\n- You send a Signal with `handle.signal(signal, ...args)`. A Signal has no return value by definition.\n- You can refer to a Signal by string name, which is useful for dynamic reference, but you will lose type inference\n\nThe following code is from inside the Client code.\n\n```typescript\nimport { count, increment } from './workflow';\n\n// init client code omitted - see Client docs\nconst handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);\n\n// these three are equivalent\nawait handle.signal(increment, 1);\nawait handle.signal<[number]>('increment', 1);\nawait client.getHandle(workflowId).signal(increment, 1);\n```\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"how-to-use-test-frameworks-in-typescript.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/how-to-use-test-frameworks-in-typescript.md","id":"typescript/how-to-use-test-frameworks-in-typescript","title":"How to use test frameworks in TypeScript","description":"TypeScript has sample tests for Jest and Mocha.","label":"Test frameworks","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","typescript"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTypeScript has sample tests for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).\n\n**Jest**\n\n- Minimum Jest version: `27.0.0`\n- [Sample test file](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/activities-examples/src/workflows.test.ts)\n- [`jest.config.js`](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/activities-examples/jest.config.js) (must use [`testEnvironment: 'node'`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testenvironment-string); `testEnvironment: 'jsdom'` is not supported)\n\n**Mocha**\n\n- [Sample test file](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/activities-examples/src/mocha/workflows.test.ts)\n- Test coverage library: [`@temporalio/nyc-test-coverage`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/tree/main/packages/nyc-test-coverage)\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"index.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/index.md","id":"typescript/index","title":"How to use the Temporal TypeScript SDK","description":"Add the Temporal TypeScript SDK to your project.","label":"Temporal TypeScript SDK","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","typescript"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/temporalio.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=author%3Atemporal-sdk-team)\n\nThis project requires Node.js 14.18 or later.\n\n**Create a project**\n\n```bash\nnpx @temporalio/create@latest ./your-app\n```\n\n**Add to an existing project**\n\n```bash\nnpm install @temporalio/client @temporalio/worker @temporalio/workflow @temporalio/activity @temporalio/common\n```\n\n:::note\n\nThe TypeScript SDK is designed with TypeScript-first developer experience in mind, but it works equally well with JavaScript.\n\n:::\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"interceptors.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/interceptors.md","id":"typescript/interceptors","title":"Interceptors in TypeScript SDK","description":"Interceptors are a mechanism for users to modify inbound and outbound SDK calls.

See how to use it in this [sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/interceptors-opentelemetry).\n\n## Interceptor types\n\n- [WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor/) - Intercept Workflow inbound calls like execution, signals, and queries.\n- [WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor/) - Intercept Workflow outbound calls to Temporal APIs like scheduling Activities and starting Timers.\n- [ActivityInboundCallsInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.ActivityInboundCallsInterceptor) - Intercept inbound calls to an Activity (for example, `execute`).\n- [WorkflowClientCallsInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowClientCallsInterceptor/) - Intercept methods of [`WorkflowClient`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowClient/) and [`WorkflowHandle`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowHandle) like starting or signaling a Workflow.\n\n## How interceptors work\n\nInterceptors are run in a chain, all the interceptors work similarly, they accept 2 arguments: `input` and `next` where `next` calls the next interceptor in the chain.\nAll interceptor methods are optional—it's up to the implementor to choose which methods to intercept.\n\n## Interceptor examples\n\n<!--TODO use snipsync-->\n\n### Log start and completion of Activities\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  ActivityInput,\n  Next,\n  WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor,\n} from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport class ActivityLogInterceptor\n  implements WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor\n{\n  constructor(public readonly workflowType: string) {}\n\n  async scheduleActivity(\n    input: ActivityInput,\n    next: Next<WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor, 'scheduleActivity'>,\n  ): Promise<unknown> {\n    console.log('Starting activity', { activityType: input.activityType });\n    try {\n      return await next(input);\n    } finally {\n      console.log('Completed activity', {\n        workflow: this.workflowType,\n        activityType: input.activityType,\n      });\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Authorization\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  defaultDataConverter,\n  Next,\n  WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor,\n  WorkflowInput,\n} from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\n/**\n * WARNING: This demo is meant as a simple auth example.\n * Do not use this for actual authorization logic.\n * Auth headers should be encrypted and credentials\n * stored outside of the codebase\n */\nexport class DumbWorkflowAuthInterceptor\n  implements WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor\n{\n  public async execute(\n    input: WorkflowInput,\n    next: Next<WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor, 'execute'>,\n  ): Promise<unknown> {\n    const authHeader = input.headers.auth;\n    const { user, password } = authHeader\n      ? await defaultDataConverter.fromPayload(authHeader)\n      : undefined;\n\n    if (!(user === 'admin' && password === 'admin')) {\n      throw new Error('Unauthorized');\n    }\n    return await next(input);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo properly do authorization from Workflow code, the Workflow would need to access encryption keys and possibly authenticate against an external user database, which requires the Workflow to break isolation.\nPlease contact us if you need to discuss this further.\n\n## Interceptor registration\n\n### Activity and client interceptors registration\n\n- Activity interceptors are registered on Worker creation by passing an array of [`ActivityInboundCallsInterceptor` factory functions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.ActivityInboundCallsInterceptorFactory) through [WorkerOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#interceptors).\n\n- Client interceptors are registered on `WorkflowClient` construction by passing an array of [`WorkflowClientCallsInterceptor` factory functions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowClientCallsInterceptorFactory) via [WorkflowClientOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowClientOptions#interceptors).\n\n### Workflow interceptors registration\n\nWorkflow interceptor registration is different from the other interceptors because they run in the Workflow isolate. To register Workflow interceptors, export an `interceptors` function from a file located in the `workflows` directory and provide the name of that file to the Worker on creation via

Workflows run in a sandboxed environment and cannot do any I/O.\n1. Workflow code might get replayed at any time, generating duplicate log messages.\n\nTo work around these limitations, we recommend using the Sinks feature in the TypeScript SDK.\nSinks enable one-way export of logs, metrics, and traces from the Workflow isolate to the Node.js environment.\n\n<!--\nWorkflows in Temporal may be replayed from the beginning of their history when resumed. In order for Temporal to recreate the exact state Workflow code was in, the code is required to be fully deterministic. To prevent breaking [determinism](/typescript/determinism), in the TypeScript SDK, Workflow code runs in an isolated execution environment and may not use any of the Node.js APIs or communicate directly with the outside world. -->\n\nSinks are written as objects with methods. Similar to Activities, they are declared in the Worker and then proxied in Workflow code, and it helps to share types between both.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Comparing Sinks, Activities and Interceptors</summary>\n\nSinks are similar to Activities in that they are both registered on the Worker and proxied into the Workflow.\nHowever, they differ from Activities in important ways:\n\n- Sink functions don't return any value back to the Workflow and cannot not be awaited.\n- Sink calls are not recorded in Workflow histories (no timeouts or retries).\n- Sink functions are _always_ run on the same Worker that runs the Workflow they are called from.\n\n</details>\n\n### Declaring the Sink Interface\n\nExplicitly declaring a Sink's interface is optional, but is useful for ensuring type safety in subsequent steps:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-interface-->\n\n[sinks/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/sinks/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nimport { LoggerSinks, proxySinks, Sinks } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport interface AlertSinks extends Sinks {\n  alerter: {\n    alert(message: string): void;\n  };\n}\n\nexport type MySinks = AlertSinks & LoggerSinks;\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n### Implementing Sinks\n\nImplementing Sinks is a two-step process.\n\n#### Implement and inject the Sink function into a Worker\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-worker-->\n\n[sinks/src/worker.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/sinks/src/worker.ts)\n\n```ts\nimport { defaultSinks, InjectedSinks, Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';\nimport { MySinks } from './workflows';\n\nasync function main() {\n  const sinks: InjectedSinks<MySinks> = {\n    ...defaultSinks(),\n    alerter: {\n      alert: {\n        fn(workflowInfo, message) {\n          console.log(`sending SMS alert!\nworkflow: ${workflowInfo.runId}\nmessage: ${message}`);\n        },\n        callDuringReplay: false, // The default\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  const worker = await Worker.create({\n    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),\n    taskQueue: 'sinks',\n    sinks,\n  });\n  await worker.run();\n  console.log('Worker gracefully shutdown');\n}\n\nmain().catch((err) => {\n  console.error(err);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n- Sink function implementations are passed as an object into [WorkerOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions/#sinks)\n- You can specify whether you want the injected function to be called during Workflow replay by setting the `callDuringReplay` boolean option.\n\n#### Proxy and call a Sink function from a Workflow\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-workflow-->\n\n[sinks/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/sinks/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nconst { alerter, defaultWorkerLogger } = proxySinks<MySinks>();\n\nexport async function sinkWorkflow(): Promise<string> {\n  defaultWorkerLogger.info('default logger: Workflow Execution started', {});\n  alerter.alert('alerter: Workflow Execution started');\n  return 'Hello, Temporal!';\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nSome important features of the [InjectedSinkFunction](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.InjectedSinkFunction) interface:\n\n- **Injected WorkflowInfo argument**: The first argument of a Sink function implementation is a [`workflowInfo` object](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowInfo/) that contains useful metadata.\n- **Limited arguments types**: The remaining Sink function arguments are copied between the sandbox and the Node.js environment using the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm).\n- **No return value**: To prevent breaking determinism, Sink functions cannot return values to the Workflow.\n\n#### Advanced: Performance considerations and non-blocking Sinks\n\nThe injected sink function contributes to the overall Workflow Task processing duration.\n\n- If you have a long-running sink function, such as one that tries to communicate with external services, you might start seeing Workflow Task timeouts.\n- The effect is multiplied when using `callDuringReplay: true` and replaying long Workflow histories because the Workflow Task timer starts when the first history page is delivered to the Worker.\n\n## Logging in Workers and Clients\n\nThe Worker comes with a default logger which defaults to log any messages with level `INFO` and higher to `STDERR` using `console.error`.\nThere are 5 levels in total: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`.\n\nThe reason we only offer a default logger is to minimize Worker dependencies and allow SDK users to bring their own logger.\n\n### Customizing the default logger\n\nTemporal ships a [`DefaultLogger`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.DefaultLogger/) that implements the basic interface:\n\n#### Example: Set up the DefaultLogger to only log messages with level WARN and higher\n\n```ts\nimport { DefaultLogger, Runtime } from '@temporalio/worker';\n\nconst logger = new DefaultLogger('WARN', ({ level, message }) => {\n  console.log(`Custom logger: ${level} — ${message}`);\n});\nRuntime.install({ logger });\n```\n\n#### Example: Accumulate logs for testing/reporting\n\n```ts\nimport { DefaultLogger, LogEntry } from '@temporalio/worker';\n\nconst logs: LogEntry[] = [];\nconst logger = new DefaultLogger('TRACE', (entry) => logs.push(entry));\nlog.debug('hey', { a: 1 });\nlog.info('ho');\nlog.warn('lets', { a: 1 });\nlog.error('go');\n```\n\nThe log levels are [listed here](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/worker#loglevel) in increasing order of severity.\n\n### Using a custom logger\n\nA common logging use case is logging to a file to be picked up by a collector like the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/nodejs/?tab=winston30).\n\n```ts\nimport { Runtime } from '@temporalio/worker';\nimport winston from 'winston';\n\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  level: 'info',\n  format: winston.format.json(),\n  transports: [new transports.File({ filename: '/path/to/worker.log' })],\n});\nRuntime.install({ logger });\n```\n\n## Metrics\n\nFor information about metrics, see the [Metrics section on the Deploy Checklist](/typescript/production-deploy#metrics) page.\n\n## OpenTelemetry tracing\n\nThe [`interceptors-opentelemetry`](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/interceptors-opentelemetry) sample shows how to use the SDK's built-in OpenTelemetry tracing to trace everything from starting a Workflow to Workflow Execution to running an Activity from that Workflow.\n\nThe built-in tracing uses protobuf message headers (like [this one](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/b2b8ae6592a8730dd5be6d90569d1aea84e1712f/temporal/api/workflowservice/v1/request_response.proto#L161) when starting a Workflow) to propagate the tracing information from the client to the Workflow and from the Workflow to its successors (when Continued As New), children, and Activities.\nAll of these executions are linked with a single trace identifier and have the proper parent->child span relation.\n\nTracing is compatible between different Temporal SDKs as long as compatible [context propagators](https://opentelemetry.lightstep.com/core-concepts/context-propagation/) are used.\n\n### Context propagation\n\nThe TypeScript SDK uses the global OpenTelemetry propagator.\n\nTo extend the default ([Trace Context](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/packages/opentelemetry-core/README.md#w3ctracecontextpropagator-propagator) and [Baggage](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/packages/opentelemetry-core/README.md#baggage-propagator) propagators) to also include the [Jaeger propagator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger), follow these steps:\n\n- `npm i @opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger`\n\n- At the top level of your Workflow code, add the following lines:\n\n  ```js\n  import { propagation } from '@opentelemetry/api';\n  import {\n    CompositePropagator,\n    W3CBaggagePropagator,\n    W3CTraceContextPropagator,\n  } from '@opentelemetry/core';\n  import { JaegerPropagator } from '@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger';\n\n  propagation.setGlobalPropagator(\n    new CompositePropagator({\n      propagators: [\n        new W3CTraceContextPropagator(),\n        new W3CBaggagePropagator(),\n        new JaegerPropagator(),\n      ],\n    }),\n  );\n  ```\n\nSimilarly, you can customize the OpenTelemetry `NodeSDK` propagators by following the instructions in the [Initialize the SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/experimental/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-node#initialize-the-sdk) section of the

feel free to ignore or modify these instructions per your own needs.\n\n:::\n\n## Add Temporal to your Next.js project\n\nYou can install Temporal's packages with a single dependency, then set up folders and files for your Workflow, Activity, and Worker code:\n\n```bash\nnpm i @temporalio/client @temporalio/worker @temporalio/workflow @temporalio/activity # in Next.js project root\nmkdir -p temporal/src # create folder, recursively\ncd temporal\ntouch src/worker.ts src/workflows.ts src/activities.ts\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>\n\nConfigure TypeScript to compile from `temporal/src` to `temporal/lib` with a `tsconfig.json`.\n\n</summary>\n\nSample `tsconfig.json` to get you started:\n\n```js\n// /temporal/tsconfig.json\n{\n  \"extends\": \"@tsconfig/node16/tsconfig.json\", // optional but nice to have\n  \"version\": \"4.4.2\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": false,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": false,\n    \"declaration\": true,\n    \"declarationMap\": true,\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"composite\": true,\n    \"rootDir\": \"./src\",\n    \"outDir\": \"./lib\"\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*.ts\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\n\nFor convenience, you may want to set up some npm scripts to run the builds in your project root `package.json`.\n\n</summary>\n\n```js\n// /package.json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"npm-run-all -l build:temporal --parallel dev:temporal dev:next start:worker\",\n    \"dev:next\": \"next dev\",\n    \"dev:temporal\": \"tsc --build --watch ./temporal/tsconfig.json\",\n    \"build:next\": \"next build\",\n    \"build:temporal\": \"tsc --build ./temporal/tsconfig.json\",\n    \"start\": \"npm run dev\",\n    \"start:worker\": \"nodemon ./temporal/lib/worker\",\n    \"lint\": \"eslint .\"\n  },\n```\n\nIn the above example we use `npm-run-all` and `nodemon` so that we are able to do 4 things:\n\n- build Temporal once\n- start Next.js locally\n- start a Temporal Worker\n- rebuild Temporal files on change\n\nin a single `npm run dev` command.\n\n</details>\n\n## Write your first Workflow, Activity and Worker\n\nInside of `/temporal/src/activities.ts` we'll write a simple Activity function to start with:\n\n```ts\n// /temporal/src/activities.ts\nimport { Context } from '@temporalio/activity';\n\nexport async function purchase(id: string): Promise<string> {\n  console.log(`Purchased ${id}!`);\n  return Context.current().info.activityId;\n}\n```\n\nActivities are the only way to interact with the outside world in Temporal (e.g. making API requests, or accessing the filesystem).\nSee the [Activities docs](/typescript/activities) for more info.\n\nInside of `/temporal/src/workflows.ts` we'll write a Workflow function that calls this Activity:\n\n```ts\n// /temporal/src/workflows.ts\nimport { proxyActivities, sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';\nimport type * as activities from './activities'; // purely for type safety\n\nconst { purchase } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',\n});\n\nexport async function OneClickBuy(id: string): Promise<string> {\n  const result = await purchase(id); // calling the activity\n  await sleep('10 seconds'); // demo use of timer\n  console.log(`Activity ID: ${result} executed!`);\n}\n```\n\nWorkflow code is bundled and run inside a [deterministic v8 isolate](/typescript/determinism), so we can persist and replay every state change.\nThis is why Workflow code must be separate from Activity code, and why we have to `proxyActivities` instead of directly importing them.\nWorkflows also have access to a special set of [Workflow APIs](/typescript/workflows#workflow-apis) which we recommend exploring next.\n\nWith your Workflows and Activities done, you can now write the Worker that will host both and poll the `tutorial` Task Queue:\n\n```ts\n// /temporal/src/worker.ts\nimport { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';\nimport * as activities from './activities';\n\nrun().catch((err) => console.log(err));\n\nasync function run() {\n  const worker = await Worker.create({\n    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'), // passed to Webpack for bundling\n    activities, // directly imported in Node.js\n    taskQueue: 'tutorial',\n  });\n  await worker.run();\n}\n```\n\nSee the full [Worker docs](/typescript/workers) for more info.\nYou should now be able to run your Worker with `npm run build:temporal && npm run start:worker`, but it's not very exciting because you have no way to start a Workflow yet.\n\n:::tip Pro tip\n\nYou actually _can_ start a Workflow with [`tctl`](/tctl-v1/workflow#start) with just a Worker running, and no Client code written!\nIt is out of scope for this tutorial but try to `brew install tctl` and then `tctl workflow run --tq tutorial --wt OneClickBuy --et 60 -i '\"Temporal CLI\"'` if you enjoy developing with CLIs.\n\n:::\n\n## Write a Temporal Client inside a Next.js API Route\n\nWe will use Next.js API routes to expose a serverless endpoint that can be called by our frontend and then communicate with Temporal on the backend:\n\n```bash\n# in Next.js project root\nmkdir pages/api\ntouch pages/api/startBuy.ts\n```\n\nNow we will create a Client and start a Workflow Execution:\n\n```ts\n// pages/api/startBuy.ts\nimport { Connection, WorkflowClient } from '@temporalio/client';\nimport { OneClickBuy } from '../../temporal/lib/workflows.js';\n\nexport default async function startBuy(req, res) {\n  const { itemId } = req.body; // TODO: validate itemId and req.method\n  const client = new WorkflowClient();\n  const handle = await client.start(OneClickBuy, {\n    workflowId: 'business-meaningful-id',\n    // must match the taskQueue polled by Worker above\n    taskQueue: 'tutorial',\n    args: [itemId],\n    // workflowId: // TODO: use business-meaningful user/transaction ID here\n  }); // kick off the purchase async\n\n  res.status(200).json({ workflowId: handle.workflowId });\n}\n```\n\nNow if you have Next.js and Temporal running, you can at least start a Workflow Execution:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev # start Temporal and Next.js in parallel\ncurl -d '{\"itemId\":\"item123\"}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/startBuy\n```\n\nThe terminal that has your Temporal Worker will print `Purchased item123` if everything is working properly.\n\n## Call the API Route from the Next.js frontend\n\nIf you are an experienced React/Next.js dev you should know what to do here.\nFor tutorial purposes we will just assume you have an `itemId` to use here; in real life you are likely to pull this from some other data source like Shopify or a database.\n\n```ts\n// /pages/index.ts or whatever page you are on\n// inside event handler\nfetch('/api/startBuy', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n  body: JSON.stringify({ itemId }),\n});\n```\n\nWe recommend tracking the state of this API call and possibly toasting success, [per our sample code](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/1f76cb6f78ef494074b937268c14fcc078e36956/nextjs-ecommerce-oneclick/pages/index.tsx#L143), but of course it is up to you what UX you want to provide.\n\n## Deploying your Temporal + Next.js app\n\nYour Next.js app, including Next.js API Routes with Temporal Clients in them, can be deployed anywhere Next.js can be deployed, including in serverless environments like Vercel or Netlify.\n\n:::important\n\nHowever, your Temporal Workers **must** be deployed in traditional \"serverful\" environments (e.g. with EC2, Digital Ocean or Render, not a serverless environment).\n\n:::\n\n**Both Temporal Clients and Temporal Workers must be configured to communicate with a Temporal Server instance**, whether self-hosted or Temporal Cloud.\nYou will need to configure gRPC connection address, namespace, and mTLS cert and key (strongly recommended).\n\n```ts\n// before Worker.create call in worker.ts\nconst connection = await NativeConnection.connect({\n  address,\n  tls: {\n    serverNameOverride,\n    serverRootCACertificate,\n    clientCertPair: {\n      crt: fs.readFileSync(clientCertPath),\n      key: fs.readFileSync(clientKeyPath),\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n// inside each Client call inside API Route\nconst connection = await Connection.connect({\n  address,\n  tls: {\n    serverNameOverride,\n    serverRootCACertificate,\n    clientCertPair: {\n      crt: fs.readFileSync(clientCertPath),\n      key: fs.readFileSync(clientKeyPath),\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n[See the mTLS tutorial](/typescript/security#mtls-tutorial) for full details, or get in touch with us on Slack if you have reached this stage.\n\n## Production Concerns\n\nAs you move into production with your app, please review our docs on:\n\n- [Securing](/typescript/security)\n- [Testing](/typescript/testing)\n- [Patching](/typescript/patching) (aka migrating code to new versions)\n- [Logging](/typescript/logging)\n- [Production Deploy Checklist](/typescript/production-deploy)\n\nYou will also want to have a plan for **monitoring and scaling your Temporal Workers** that host and execute your Activity and Workflow code (separately from monitoring and scaling Temporal Server itself).\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAt this point, you have a working full stack example of a Temporal Workflow running inside your Next.js app.\n\nYou can explore adding [Signals and Queries](/typescript/workflows/#signals-and-queries) to your Workflow, then adding a new API Route to call them.\nYou can choose to set up one API Route per Signal or Query, or have one API Route handle all of them, Temporal has no opinion on how you set up routing.\n\nAgain, for a fully working example, you can check our [samples-typescript repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/nextjs-ecommerce-oneclick).\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"package-initializer.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/package-initializer.md","id":"typescript/package-initializer","title":"@temporalio/create Package Initializer","description":"temporalio/create is an optional tool to set up a new Temporal project starting from our samples repo. `npx @temporalio/create@latest ./example`","label":"@temporalio/create","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n> **@temporalio/create** [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@temporalio/create)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@temporalio/create) | [GitHub](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/tree/main/packages/create-project)\n\n`@temporalio/create` is an optional tool to set up a new Temporal project starting from [our samples repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript).\n\n### Usage\n\n> See the [Getting started](/typescript/introduction/#getting-started) guide for basic usage and environment set up before running this tool.\n\n```bash\nnpx @temporalio/create@latest ./example\n```\n\n#### Optional flags\n\n- `--sample` — Which sample to bootstrap the app with.

So we have to keep both the old and new code when migrating Workflows while they are still running.","label":"Patching (Migrating)","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n## Alternatives\n\nBefore you explore our patching/versioning API, check if your needs can be addressed in other ways:\n\n- [Version Task Queue](#version-task-queue)\n- [Version Workflow Name](#version-workflow-name)\n\nBoth options mean that Workflows running `v1` code will never migrate to `v2` code: they will run `v1` code to completion.\nIf you would like to update Workflows running `v1` _while they are still running_, you [may need to \"patch in\" code](#do-i-need-to-patch).\n\n### Version Task Queue\n\nIf we're currently running our v1 Workflow code on Workers that poll on `queue1`, we can run v2 Workflow code on Workers that poll on `queue2`:\n\n1. Leave some Workers running your v1 `Workflow`, on the `queue1` Task Queue.\n1. Change your `Workflow` code and spin up new Workers that are polling a `queue2` Task Queue.\n1. Cut over your Clients to only call `Workflow` on `queue2` from now on.\n1. Remove your v1 Workers when all the v1 Workflows have completed.\n\n### Version Workflow Name\n\nWhile versioning the Task Queue is usually easier, we can also create a new version of a Workflow by copying it and changing its name:\n\n1. Copy `Workflow1`'s code to a `Workflow2` function and change what you need.\n1. Register `Workflow2` in your Workers alongside `Workflow1`.\n1. Cut over your Clients to only call `Workflow2` from now on.\n1. Remove `Workflow1` code when none of them are running anymore.\n\n## Do I need to Patch?\n\nYou may need to patch if:\n\n- You want to change the remaining logic of a Workflow while it is still running\n- If your new logic can result in a different execution path\n\nThis added `sleep()` can result in a different execution path:\n\n```ts\n// from v1\nexport async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {\n  await runActivity();\n  return 7;\n}\n\n// to v2\nexport async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {\n  await sleep('1 day');\n\n  await runActivity();\n  return 7;\n}\n```\n\nIf v2 is deployed while there's a Workflow on the `runActivity` step, when the Activity completes, the Worker will try to replay the Workflow (in order to continue Workflow execution), notice that the sleep command is called and doesn't match with the Workflow's Event History, and throw a non-determinism error.\n\nAdding a Signal Handler for a Signal type that has never been sent before does not need patching:\n\n```ts\n// from v1\nexport async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {\n  await sleep('1 days');\n  return value;\n}\n\n// to v2\nconst updateValueSignal = defineSignal<[number]>('updateValue');\n\nexport async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {\n  setHandler(updateValueSignal, (newValue) => (value = newValue));\n\n  await sleep('1 days');\n  return value;\n}\n```\n\n## Migrating Workflows in Patches\n\nWorkflow code has to be [deterministic](/typescript/determinism) by taking the same code path when replaying history events.\nAny Workflow code change that affects the order in which commands are generated breaks this assumption.\n\nSo we have to keep both the old and new code when migrating Workflows while they are still running:\n\n- When replaying, use the original code version that generated the ongoing event history.\n- When executing a new code path, always execute the\n  new code.\n\n<details>\n<summary>30 Min Video: Introduction to Versioning\n</summary>\n\nBecause we design for potentially long-running Workflows at scale, versioning with Temporal works differently than with other Workflow systems.\nWe explain more in this optional 30 minute introduction: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY)\n\n</details>\n\n## TypeScript SDK Patching API\n\nIn principle, the TypeScript SDK's patching mechanism works in a similar \"feature-flag\" fashion to the other SDK's, however, the \"versioning\" API has been updated to a notion of \"patching in\" code.\nThere are three steps to this reflecting three stages of migration:\n\n- Running v1 code with vFinal patched in concurrently\n- Running vFinal code with deprecation markers for vFinal patches\n- Running \"just\" vFinal code.\n\nThis is best explained in sequence (click through to follow along using our SDK sample).\n\nGiven an initial Workflow version `v1`:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-1-->\n\n[patching-api/src/workflows-v1.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/patching-api/src/workflows-v1.ts)\n\n```ts\n// v1\nexport async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {\n  await activityA();\n  await sleep('1 days'); // arbitrary long sleep to simulate a long running workflow we need to patch\n  await activityThatMustRunAfterA();\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nWe decide to update our code and run `activityB` instead.\nThis is our desired end state, `vFinal`.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-final-->\n\n[patching-api/src/workflows-vFinal.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/patching-api/src/workflows-vFinal.ts)\n\n```ts\n// vFinal\nexport async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {\n  await activityB();\n  await sleep('1 days');\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n**Problem: We cannot directly deploy `vFinal` until we know for sure there are no more running Workflows created using `v1` code.**\n\nInstead we must deploy `v2` (below) and use the [`patched`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#patched) function to check which version of the code should be executed.\n\nPatching is a three-step process:\n\n1. Patch in new code with `patched` and run it alongside old code\n2. Remove old code and `deprecatePatch`\n3. When you are sure all old Workflows are done executing, remove `deprecatePatch`\n\n### Step 1: Patch in new code\n\n`patched` inserts a marker into the Workflow history.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/139673361-35d61b38-ab94-401e-ae7b-feaa52eae8c6.png)\n\nDuring replay, when a Worker picks up a history with that marker it will fail the Workflow task when running Workflow code that does not emit the same patch marker (in this case `your-change-id`); therefore it is safe to deploy code from `v2` in a \"feature flag\" alongside the original version (`v1`).\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-2-->\n\n[patching-api/src/workflows-v2.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/patching-api/src/workflows-v2.ts)\n\n```ts\n// v2\nimport { patched } from '@temporalio/workflow';\nexport async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {\n  if (patched('my-change-id')) {\n    await activityB();\n    await sleep('1 days');\n  } else {\n    await activityA();\n    await sleep('1 days');\n    await activityThatMustRunAfterA();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n### Step 2: Deprecate patch\n\nOnce we know that all Workflows started with `v1` code have completed we can [deprecate the patch](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#deprecatepatch).\nDeprecated patches bridge between `v2` and `vFinal` (the end result), they work similarly to regular patches by recording a marker in the Workflow history, this marker does not fail replay when Workflow code does not emit it.\n\nIf while we're deploying `v3` (below) there are still live Workers running `v2` code and those Workers pick up Workflow histories generated by `v3`, they will safely use the patched branch.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-3-->\n\n[patching-api/src/workflows-v3.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/patching-api/src/workflows-v3.ts)\n\n```ts\n// v3\nimport { deprecatePatch } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {\n  deprecatePatch('my-change-id');\n  await activityB();\n  await sleep('1 days');\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n### Step 3: Solely deploy new code\n\n`vFinal` is safe to deploy once all `v2` or earlier Workflows are complete due to the assertion mentioned above.\n\n## Upgrading Workflow dependencies\n\nUpgrading Workflow dependencies (such as ones installed into `node_modules`) _might_ break determinism in unpredictable ways.\nWe recommended using a lock file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to fix Workflow dependency versions and gain control of when they're updated.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"production-deploy.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/production-deploy.md","id":"typescript/production-deploy","title":"Production Deploy Checklist for TypeScript SDK","description":"Recommended steps to take before deploying your Temporal app to production.","label":"Deploy Checklist","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nThe following are recommended steps to take before deploying your Temporal application to production.\n\n## Production Temporal Cluster\n\nEither use Temporal Cloud ([join the waitlist](https://pages.temporal.io/cloud-early-access)) or deploy a self-hosted Temporal Cluster:\n\n- [Deployment guide](/server/production-deployment/)\n- [Scaling checklist](/server/production-deployment#checklist-for-scaling-temporal)\n\n## Linting and types\n\nIf you started your project with [`@temporalio/create`](/typescript/package-initializer), you already have our recommended TypeScript and ESLint configurations.\n\nIf you incrementally added Temporal to an existing app, we do recommend setting up linting and types as they will help catch bugs well before you ship them to production, and improve your development feedback loop.\nTake a look at [our recommended .eslintrc file](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/.shared/.eslintrc.js) and tweak to taste.\n\n## Configure Connections and Namespaces\n\nTemporal Clients and Workers connect with Temporal Clusters through gRPC.\n\n- While you were developing locally, all these connections were set to their [default gRPC ports](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster) on localhost.\n- In production, you will need to configure address, Namespace, and encryption settings:\n\n  ```ts\n  export function getEnv(): Env {\n    return {\n      // NOT web.foo.bar.tmprl.cloud\n      address: 'foo.bar.tmprl.cloud',\n      namespace: 'foo.bar',\n      // in project root\n      clientCertPath: 'foobar.pem',\n      clientKeyPath: 'foobar.key',\n      // just to ensure task queue is same on client and worker, totally optional\n      taskQueue: process.env.TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE || 'hello-world-mtls',\n      // not usually needed:\n      // serverNameOverride: process.env.TEMPORAL_SERVER_NAME_OVERRIDE,\n      // serverRootCACertificatePath: process.env.TEMPORAL_SERVER_ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH,\n    };\n  }\n  ```\n\nFor more information, see [Connecting to Temporal Cloud (with mTLS)](/typescript/security#local-mtls-sample-tutorial).\n\n## Pre-build code\n\nThis information has been moved to [Register Types](/application-development/foundations/#register-types) section in the application developer guide.\n\n## Logging\n\nSend logs and errors to a logging service, so that when things go wrong, you can see what happened.\n\nFor more information about sending logs, see [Logging](/typescript/logging).\n\n## Metrics and tracing\n\n### Options\n\nWorkers can emit metrics and traces. There are a few [telemetry options](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.TelemetryOptions) that can be provided to [`Runtime.install`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Runtime/#install). The common options are:\n\n- `metrics: { otel: { url } }`: The URL of a gRPC [OpenTelemetry collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).\n- `metrics: { prometheus: { bindAddress } }`: Address on the Worker host that will have metrics for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to scrape.\n\nTo set up tracing of Workflows and Activities, use our [opentelemetry-interceptors](/typescript/logging#opentelemetry-tracing) package.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nHere is the [full list of SDK metrics](/references/sdk-metrics/). Some of them are used in the [Worker Tuning Guide](/application-development/worker-performance) to determine how to change your deployment configuration. The guide also assumes you track the host-level metrics that are important for measuring your application's load (for many applications, this is just CPU, but some applications may run into other bottlenecks—like with Activities that use a lot of memory, or open a lot of sockets). How you track host-level metrics depends on where you deploy your Workers.\n\n## Performance tuning\n\nIf you are experiencing system performance issues, make sure that you have checked that the bottleneck is not with your Temporal Cluster before turning to the performance of your Workers.\n\nWe endeavor to give you good defaults, so you don't have to worry about them, but there are a few key settings you may want to explore if you are pushing system limits:\n\n- [Worker Options](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions/#maxcachedworkflows), for example:\n  - `maxCachedWorkflows` to limit Workflow cache size and trade memory for CPU (biggest lever for Worker performance)\n  - `maxConcurrentActivityTaskExecutions` and other options for tuning concurrency\n  - `stickyQueueScheduleToStartTimeout` to determine how quickly Temporal stops trying to send work to Workers that are no longer present, via [Sticky Queues](/concepts/what-is-a-sticky-execution)\n  - See [Worker Tuning Guide](/application-development/worker-performance)\n- [Activity Timeouts and Retries](/typescript/activities#activity-timeouts) as you gain an understanding of Temporal and the services you rely on, you will likely want to adjust the timeouts and Retry Policy to reflect your desired behavior.\n  - Note that there are separate [Timeouts and Retry Policy](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowOptions/#workflowruntimeout) at the Workflow level, but we do not encourage their usage unless you know what you are doing.\n- _to be completed as we get more user feedback_\n\n## Running in Docker\n\nWorkers based on TypeScript SDK can be deployed and run as Docker containers.\n\nAt this moment, we recommend usage of NodeJS 16 (note that there are known issues with NodeJS 18). Both `amd64` and `arm64` platforms are supported. A glibc-based image is required; musl-based images are _not_ supported (see below).\n\nThe easiest way to deploy a TypeScript SDK Worker on Docker is to start with the `node:16-bullseye` image. For example:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:16-bullseye\n\nCOPY . /app\nWORKDIR /app\n\nRUN npm install --only=production \\\n    && npm run build\n\nCMD [\"build/worker.js\"]\n```\n\nFor smaller images and/or more secure deployments, it is also possible to use `-slim` Docker image variants (like `node:16-bullseye-slim`) or `distroless/nodejs` Docker images (like `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:16`) with the below caveats.\n\n### Using `node:slim` images\n\n`node:slim` images do not contain some of the common packages found in regular images. This results in significantly smaller images.\n\nHowever, TypeScript SDK requires the presence of root TLS certificates (the `ca-certificates` package), which are not included in `slim` images. `ca-certificates` package is required even when connecting to a local Temporal Server or when using a server connection config that doesn't explicitly use TLS.\n\nFor this reason, the `ca-certificates` package must be installed during the construction of the Docker image. For example:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:16-bulleyes-slim\n\nRUN apt-get update \\\n    && apt-get install -y ca-certificates \\\n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# ... same as with regular image\n```\n\nFailure to install this dependency results in a `[TransportError: transport error]` runtime error, because the certificates cannot be verified.\n\n### Using `distroless/nodejs` images\n\n`distroless/nodejs` images include only the files that are strictly required to execute `node`. This results in even smaller images (approximately half the size of `node:slim` images). It also significantly reduces the surface of potential security issues that could be exploited by a hacker in the resulting Docker images.\n\nIt is generally possible and safe to execute TypeScript SDK Workers using `distroless/nodejs` images (unless your code itself requires dependencies that are not included in `distroless/nodejs`).\n\nNote however that some tools required for the build process (notably the `npm` command) are _not_ included in the `distroless/nodejs` image. This might result in various error messages during the Docker build.\n\nThe recommanded solution is to use a multi-step Dockerfile. For example:\n\n```dockerfile\n# -- BUILD STEP --\n\nFROM node:16-bulleyes AS builder\n\nCOPY . /app\nWORKDIR /app\n\nRUN npm install --only=production \\\n    && npm run build\n\n# -- RESULTING IMAGE --\n\nFROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:16\n\nCOPY --from=builder /app /app\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCMD [\"build/worker.js\"]\n```\n\n### Properly configure Node's memory in Docker\n\nBy default, `node` configures its maximum old-gen memory to 25% of the _physical memory_ of the machine on which it is executing, with a maximum of 4 GB. This is very likely inappropriate when running node in a Docker environment and can result in either under usage of available memory (`node` only uses a fraction of the memory allocated to the container) or overusage (`node` tries to use more memory than what is allocated to the container, which will eventually lead to the process being killed by the operating system).\n\nIt is therefore recommended that you always explicitly set the `--max-old-space-size` `node` argument to approximately 80% of the maximum size (in megabytes) that you want to allocate the `node` process. You might need some experimentation and adjustment to find the most appropriate value based on your specific application.\n\nIn practice, it is generally easier to provide this argument through the [`NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_optionsoptions).\n\n### Do not use Alpine\n\nAlpine replaces glibc with musl, which is incompatible with the Rust core of the TypeScript SDK.\nIf you receive errors like below, it's probably because you are using Alpine.\n\n```sh\nError: Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: No such file or directory (needed by /opt/app/node_modules/@temporalio/core-bridge/index.node)\n```\n\nOr like this:\n\n```sh\nError: Error relocating /opt/app/node_modules/@temporalio/core-bridge/index.node: __register_atfork: symbol

Security","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTemporal Workers and Clients connect with your Temporal Cluster via gRPC, and must be configured securely for production.\nThere are three main features to know:\n\n- **Namespaces** help isolate code from each other\n- **TLS Encryption** helps encrypt code in transit\n- **Data Converter** helps encrypt code at rest (available soon)\n\nTemporal Server internally has [other Security features](/security), particularly Authorization.\n\nAn important part of Temporal's security model is that Temporal Server only manages state and time - it never actually sees or runs your Workflow/Activity code.\nCode is hosted by Temporal Workers that you run, and Temporal Server only sees inbound/outbound gRPC messages.\nThis eliminates a whole class of problems particularly when providing Temporal to multiple teams in your company, or when working with Temporal Cloud as a customer.\n\n## Namespaces\n\nimport Content from '../concepts/what-is-a-namespace.md'\n\n<Content />\n\nAll SDK connections (whether Workers or Clients) are to a specific namespace.\nIf not specified in [WorkflowClientOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowClientOptions), this defaults to the `default` namespace.\n\n```ts\nconst connection = await Connection.connect();\n\nconst client = new WorkflowClient({\n  connection,\n  namespace: 'your-custom-namespace', // defaults to 'default'\n});\n```\n\n## Encryption in transit with mTLS\n\nThere are two classes in the SDK that connect to the Temporal server, the [Worker](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker) and the client [Connection](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.Connection/).\nWhen instantiating either of them, you may choose whether to connect securely or not.\n\n- In order to connect to the server using TLS, set a _truthy_ value (`true` or [TLSConfig](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.TLSConfig) for custom options) in the `tls` configuration option.\n- Use [`ServerOptions.tls`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.ServerOptions#tls) when [creating](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker/#create) a new Worker and\n  [`ConnectionOptions.tls`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.ConnectionOptions#tls) for the [`Connection`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.Connection) constructor.\n- The client connection also accepts [gRPC credentials](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/node/grpc.credentials.html) at [`ConnectionOptions.credentials`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.ConnectionOptions#tls) as long as `tls` is not also specified.\n\nA full example for Clients looks like this:\n\n```js\nimport { Connection, WorkflowClient } from '@temporalio/client';\n\nconst connection = await Connection.connect({\n  // defaults port to 7233 if not specified\n  address: 'foo.bar.tmprl.cloud',\n  tls: {\n    // set to true if TLS without mTLS\n    // See docs for other TLS options\n    clientCertPair: {\n      crt: clientCert,\n      key: clientKey,\n    },\n  },\n});\nconst client = new WorkflowClient({\n  connection,\n  namespace: 'foo.bar', // as explained in Namespaces section\n});\n```\n\nA full example for Workers looks like this:\n\n```js\nimport { NativeConnection, Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';\nimport * as activities from './activities';\n\nasync function run() {\n  const connection = await NativeConnection.connect({\n    address: 'foo.bar.tmprl.cloud', // defaults port to 7233 if not specified\n    tls: {\n      // set to true if TLS without mTLS\n      // See docs for other TLS options\n      clientCertPair: {\n        crt: clientCert,\n        key: clientKey,\n      },\n    },\n  });\n\n  const worker = await Worker.create({\n    connection,\n    namespace: 'foo.bar', // as explained in Namespaces section\n    // ...\n  });\n  await worker.run();\n}\n\nrun().catch((err) => {\n  console.error(err);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n```\n\nIf you are using mTLS, is completely up to you how to get the `clientCert` and `clientKey` pair into your code, whether it is reading from filesystem, secrets manager, or both.\nJust keep in mind that they are whitespace sensitive and some environment variable systems have been known to cause frustration because they modify whitespace.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\n  Example code that works for local dev and for certs hosted on AWS S3\n</summary>\n\n```ts\nlet serverRootCACertificate: Buffer | undefined;\nlet clientCertificate: Buffer | undefined;\nlet clientKey: Buffer | undefined;\nif (certificateS3Bucket) {\n  const s3 = new S3client({ region: certificateS3BucketRegion });\n  serverRootCACertificate = await s3.getObject({\n    bucket: certificateS3Bucket,\n    key: serverRootCACertificatePath,\n  });\n  clientCertificate = await s3.getObject({\n    bucket: certificateS3Bucket,\n    key: clientCertPath,\n  });\n  clientKey = await s3.getObject({\n    bucket: certificateS3Bucket,\n    key: clientKeyPath,\n  });\n} else {\n  serverRootCACertificate = fs.readFileSync(serverRootCACertificatePath);\n  clientCertificate = fs.readFileSync(clientCertPath);\n  clientKey = fs.readFileSync(clientKeyPath);\n}\n```\n\n_Thanks to our

mTLS sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/hello-world-mtls/) shows how to connect to a Temporal Cloud account.\nAfter signing up for Temporal Cloud, you should have a namespace, a server address, and a client certificate and key. Use the following environment variables to set up the sample:\n\n- **TEMPORAL_ADDRESS**: looks like `foo.bar.tmprl.cloud` (NOT web.foo.bar.tmprl.cloud)\n- **TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE**: looks like `foo.bar`\n- **TEMPORAL_CLIENT_CERT_PATH**: e.g. `/tls/ca.pem` (file contents start with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----)\n- **TEMPORAL_CLIENT_KEY_PATH**: e.g. `/tls/ca.key` (file contents start with -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----)\n\nYou can leave the remaining vars, like `TEMPORAL_SERVER_NAME_OVERRIDE` and `TEMPORAL_SERVER_ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH` blank.\nThere is another var, `TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE`, which the example defaults to `'hello-world-mtls'` but you can customize as needed.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Example environment settings</summary>\n\n```ts\nexport function getEnv(): Env {\n  return {\n    // NOT web.foo.bar.tmprl.cloud\n    address: 'foo.bar.tmprl.cloud',\n    namespace: 'foo.bar',\n    // in project root\n    clientCertPath: 'foobar.pem',\n    clientKeyPath: 'foobar.key',\n    // just to ensure task queue is same on client and worker, totally optional\n    taskQueue: process.env.TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE || 'hello-world-mtls',\n    // // not usually needed\n    // serverNameOverride: process.env.TEMPORAL_SERVER_NAME_OVERRIDE,\n    // serverRootCACertificatePath: process.env.TEMPORAL_SERVER_ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH,\n  };\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\nIf you have misconfigured your connection somehow, you will get an opaque `[TransportError: transport error]` error. Read through your settings carefully and contact us if you are sure you have checked everything.\n\nNote the difference between the gRPC and Temporal Web endpoints:\n\n- The gRPC endpoint has a DNS address of `<Namespace_ID>.tmprl.cloud`, for example: `accounting-production.f45a2.tmprl.cloud`.\n- The Temporal Web endpoint is `web.<Namespace_ID>.tmprl.cloud`, for example: `https://web.accounting-production.f45a2.tmprl.cloud`.\n\n### Local mTLS sample tutorial\n\nFollow this tutorial for setting up mTLS (Mutual TLS authentication) with Temporal Server, Client, and Worker locally.\n**For Temporal Cloud customers, there is a separate tutorial above.**\n\n1. Set up Temporal Server with mTLS encryption locally\n   - Clone the [server samples repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/) and change to the `tls/tls-simple` directory\n   - Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/master/tls/tls-simple#readme) to set up a local server with mTLS\n   - The sample does not register the default Namespace on startup, register it with: `docker exec -it tls-simple_temporal-admin-tools_1 tctl n re --retention 1 default`\n1. Configure your Temporal Client and Worker to connect with mTLS\n   - Scaffold a new Temporal project with `npx @temporalio/create@latest` using the `hello-world-mtls` template, or copy the relevant configuration from the snippets below into an existing project.\n   - Export the required environment variables:\n     ```bash\n     export TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=localhost\n     export TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE=default\n     export TEMPORAL_CLIENT_CERT_PATH=/path/to/samples-server/tls/tls-simple/certs/client.pem\n     export TEMPORAL_CLIENT_KEY_PATH=/path/to/samples-server/tls/tls-simple/certs/client.key\n     # just for the local mTLS sample\n     export TEMPORAL_SERVER_ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH=/path/to/samples-server/tls/tls-simple/certs/ca.cert\n     export TEMPORAL_SERVER_NAME_OVERRIDE=tls-sample\n     ```\n1. Test the connection with `npm run start.watch` and `npm run workflow`.\n   You should see everything working as per the regular Hello World tutorial.\n\nTemporal has no opinions on production deployment strategy other than the connections and architecture displayed here.\n\n## Encryption at rest with Payload Codec\n\n- [Data Converter ➡️ Encryption](/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter#encryption)\n- [Data Converters in TypeScript ➡️ Encryption](/typescript/data-converters#encryption)\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"testing.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/testing.md","id":"typescript/testing","title":"Testing TypeScript Workflows","label":"Testing","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n:::note Sample available\nOur samples repo contains examples of [testing with Jest](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/activities-examples/src/workflows.test.ts) and [Mocha](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/activities-examples/src/mocha/workflows.test.ts)\n:::\n\nThe TypeScript SDK comes with an optional test framework (npm `@temporalio/testing`).\n\nUpon installation, it will automatically download a test server with time skipping support (more on that later).\n\nThe test framework provides utilities for testing both Activities and Workflows.\n\n## Testing Activities\n\nActivities can be tested with [`MockActivityEnvironment`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment)\n\nThe constructor accepts an optional partial Activity [`Info`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Info) object in case any info fields are needed for the test.\n\n### Running an activity in Context\n\n[`MockActivityEnvironment.run()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment#run) runs a function in an Activity [Context](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Context).\n\n```ts\nimport { Context } from '@temporalio/activity';\nimport { MockActivityEnvironment } from '@temporalio/testing';\n\nconst env = new MockActivityEnvironment({ attempt: 2 });\nconst result = await env.run(\n  async (x) => x + Context.current().info.attempt,\n  2,\n);\nassert.equal(result, 4);\n```\n\n### Heartbeats and cancellation\n\n`MockActivityEnvironment` is an [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter) that emits a `heartbeat` event which you can use to listen for heartbeats emitted by the Activity.\n\n> NOTE: When run by a `Worker`, heartbeats are throttled to avoid overloading the server.\n> `MockActivityEnvironment`, however, does not apply any throttling.\n\nIt also exposes a `cancel` method which cancels the Activity Context.\n\n```ts\nimport { CancelledFailure, Context } from '@temporalio/activity';\nimport { MockActivityEnvironment } from '@temporalio/testing';\n\nconst env = new MockActivityEnvironment();\n\nenv.on('heartbeat', (d: unknown) => {\n  if (d === 6) {\n    env.cancel('test');\n  }\n});\n\nawait assert.rejects(\n  () =>\n    env.run(async () => {\n      Context.current().heartbeat(6);\n      await Context.current().sleep(100); // <- sleep is cancellation aware\n    }),\n  (err) => {\n    assert.ok(err instanceof CancelledFailure);\n  },\n);\n```\n\n## Testing Workflows\n\nWorkflows can be tested with [`TestWorkflowEnvironment`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment).\n\nA typical test suite would set up a single instance of the test environment to be reused in all tests (e.g. in a [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) `before()` hook or a [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) `beforeAll` hook).\n\nWhen creating an environment, [`TestWorkflowEnvironment.create`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment#create) will automatically start a test server that you can access with [`client`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment#client) and [`nativeConnection`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment#nativeconnection).\n\n### Example setup\n\n`beforeAll` and `afterAll` are injected by `jest`. To use mocha instead, change them to `before` and `after`, and import:\n\n```ts\nimport { after, before } from 'mocha';\n```\n\n```ts\nimport { TestWorkflowEnvironment } from '@temporalio/testing';\nimport { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';\nimport { v4 as uuid4 } from 'uuid';\nimport type * as Activities from './activities'; // Uses types to ensure our mock signatures match\nimport { httpWorkflow } from './workflows';\n\nlet testEnv: TestWorkflowEnvironment;\n\nbeforeAll(async () => {\n  testEnv = await TestWorkflowEnvironment.create();\n});\n\nafterAll(async () => {\n  await testEnv?.teardown();\n});\n```\n\n### Mocking Activities\n\nSince the `TestWorkflowEnvironment` is meant for testing Workflows, you'd typically want to mock your Activities in tests to avoid generating side effects.\n\n```ts\ntest('httpWorkflow with mock activity', async () => {\n  const { client, nativeConnection } = testEnv;\n\n  // Implement only the relevant activities for this workflow\n  const mockActivities: Partial<typeof Activities> = {\n    makeHTTPRequest: async () => '99',\n  };\n  const worker = await Worker.create({\n    connection: nativeConnection,\n    taskQueue: 'test',\n    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),\n    activities: mockActivities,\n  });\n  const result = await worker.runUntil(\n    await client.workflow.execute(httpWorkflow, {\n      workflowId: uuid4(),\n      taskQueue: 'test',\n    }),\n  );\n  assert.strictEqual(result, 'The answer is 99');\n});\n```\n\n### Time skipping in Workflows\n\nThe built-in test server automatically \"skips\" (fast forwards) time when no Activities are executing.\nThe test server starts in \"normal\" time, using the `TestWorkflowEnvironment.client.workflow` `execute` or `result`\nmethods switch the test server to \"skipped\" time mode until the Workflow completes.\nIf a Workflow sleeps for days, running it in the test environment will cause it to complete almost immediately.\n\n`workflows.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport async function sleeperWorkflow() {\n  await sleep('1 day');\n}\n```\n\n`test.ts`\n\n```ts\ntest('sleep completes almost immediately', async () => {\n  const worker = await Worker.create({\n    connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,\n    taskQueue: 'test',\n    workflowsPath: require.resolve('../workflows'),\n  });\n  // Does not wait an entire day\n  await worker.runUntil(\n    testEnv.client.workflow.execute(sleeperWorkflow, {\n      workflowId: uuid(),\n      taskQueue: 'test',\n    }),\n  );\n});\n```\n\n### Time skipping in Tests\n\nYou can also call `testEnv.sleep()` from your test code to advance the test server's time.\nThis is useful for testing intermediate state, or for testing infinite Workflows.\nHowever, to advance time using `testEnv.sleep()`, you need to start the Workflow using `start()`, not `execute()`.\n\n`workflow.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';\nimport { defineQuery, setHandler } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport const daysQuery = defineQuery('days');\n\nexport async function sleeperWorkflow() {\n  let numDays = 0;\n\n  setHandler(daysQuery, () => numDays);\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {\n    await sleep('1 day');\n    ++numDays;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`test.ts`\n\n```ts\ntest('advancing time using `testEnv.sleep()`', async () => {\n  // Important: `start()` starts the test server in \"normal\" mode,\n  // not skipped time mode. If you don't advance time using `testEnv.sleep()`,\n  // then `sleeperWorkflow()` will run for days.\n  handle = await testEnv.client.workflow.start(sleeperWorkflow, {\n    taskQueue,\n    workflowId: uuidv4(),\n  });\n\n  let numDays = await handle.query(daysQuery);\n  assert.strictEqual(numDays, 0);\n\n  // Advance the test server's time by 25 hours and assert that\n  // `sleeperWorkflow()` correctly incremented `numDays`.\n  await testEnv.sleep('25 hours');\n  numDays = await handle.query(daysQuery);\n  assert.strictEqual(numDays, 1);\n\n  // Advance the test server's time by an additional 25 hours and\n  // assert that `sleeperWorkflow()` incremented `numDays` a second time.\n  await testEnv.sleep('25 hours');\n  numDays = await handle.query(daysQuery);\n  assert.strictEqual(numDays, 2);\n});\n```\n\n### Time skipping in Activities\n\nWhen an Activity is executing time switches back to \"normal\",\n[`TestWorkflowEnvironment.sleep`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment/#sleep)\ncan be used outside of Workflow code to skip time.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWorkflow implementation\n</summary>\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-timer-reminder-workflow-->\n\n[timer-examples/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/timer-examples/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nexport async function processOrderWorkflow({\n  orderProcessingMS,\n  sendDelayedEmailTimeoutMS,\n}: ProcessOrderOptions): Promise<string> {\n  let processing = true;\n  // Dynamically define the timeout based on given input\n  const { processOrder } = proxyActivities<ReturnType<typeof createActivities>>(\n    {\n      startToCloseTimeout: orderProcessingMS,\n    },\n  );\n\n  const processOrderPromise = processOrder().then(() => {\n    processing = false;\n  });\n\n  await Promise.race([processOrderPromise, sleep(sendDelayedEmailTimeoutMS)]);\n\n  if (processing) {\n    await sendNotificationEmail();\n\n    await processOrderPromise;\n  }\n\n  return 'Order completed!';\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n</details>\n\n```ts\ntest('countdownWorkflow sends reminder email if processing does not complete in time', async () => {\n  // NOTE: this tests doesn't actually take days to complete, the test environment starts a test\n  // server that automatically skips time when there are no running activities.\n  let emailSent = false;\n  // createActivities defintion omitted for brevity\n  const activities: ReturnType<typeof createActivities> = {\n    async processOrder() {\n      // test server switches to \"normal\" time while an activity is executing.\n      // Call `sleep` to skip time by \"2 days\".\n      await testEnv.sleep('2 days');\n    },\n    async sendNotificationEmail() {\n      emailSent = true;\n    },\n  };\n  const worker = await Worker.create({\n    connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,\n    taskQueue: 'test',\n    workflowsPath: require.resolve('../workflows'),\n    activities,\n  });\n  await worker.runUntil(\n    testEnv.client.workflow.execute(processOrderWorkflow, {\n      workflowId: uuid(),\n      taskQueue: 'test',\n      args: [\n        {\n          orderProcessingMS: ms('3 days'),\n          sendDelayedEmailTimeoutMS: ms('1 day'),\n        },\n      ],\n    }),\n  );\n  assert.strictEqual(emailSent, true);\n});\n```\n\n### Test arbitrary functions in Workflow context\n\nIn case you need to test a function in your Workflow code that's not exported in [`workflowsPath`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions/#workflowspath), export it in a different path and register it with the Worker.\n\n`workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';\nimport { someWorkflowToRunAsChild } from './some-workflow';\n\nexport { someWorkflowToRunAsChild }; // Must be re-exported here for Worker registration\n\nexport async function functionToTest() {\n  await wf.executeChild(someWorkflowToRunAsChild);\n  // Other test code\n}\n```\n\n`test.ts`\n\n```ts\nconst worker = await Worker.create({\n  ...someOtherOptions,\n  connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,\n  workflowsPath: require.resolve(\n    './workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test',\n  ),\n});\n\nawait worker.runUntil(\n  testEnv.client.workflow.execute(functionToTest, workflowOptions),\n);\n```\n\n### Asserting from Workflow code\n\nIn some cases it's useful to assert directly in Workflow context.\n\nThe Workflow context is injected with the Node.js [`assert`](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) module and can be imported with `import assert from 'assert'`.\n\nBy default, failed `assert` statements throw `AssertionError`s which cause Workflow Tasks to fail and be indefinitely retried.\nTo prevent this, use `workflowInterceptorModules` from `@temporalio/testing`. These interceptors catch `AssertionError`s and turn them into `ApplicationFailure`s that fail the entire Workflow Execution (not just the Workflow Task).\n\n`workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport assert from 'assert';\n\nexport async function functionToTest() {\n  assert.ok(false);\n}\n```\n\n`test.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  TestWorkflowEnvironment,\n  workflowInterceptorModules,\n} from '@temporalio/testing';\n\nconst worker = await Worker.create({\n  ...someOtherOptions,\n  connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,\n  interceptors: {\n    workflowModules: workflowInterceptorModules,\n  },\n  workflowsPath: require.resolve(\n    './workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test',\n  ),\n});\n\nawait worker.runUntil(\n  testEnv.client.workflow.execute(functionToTest, workflowOptions), // Throws WorkflowFailedError\n);\n```\n\n### Testing with Jest\n\nThere are a couple of caveats for testing with Jest:\n\n1. The Temporal TypeScript SDK only supports Jest `>= 27.0.0`.\n1. Make sure you run Jest with [`testEnvironment: 'node'`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testenvironment-string). `testEnvironment: 'jsdom'` is not supported.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"troubleshooting.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/troubleshooting.md","id":"typescript/troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting Issues with the TypeScript SDK","description":"This document is a quick checklist of common user errors for your reference.","label":"Troubleshooting","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nThis document is a quick checklist of common user errors for your reference.\n\n## Two Locations to Watch\n\n- Workflow Errors are reflected in Temporal Web\n- Worker errors and logs are reflected in the terminal.\n\nIf something isn't behaving the way you expect, make sure to check both locations for helpful error messages.\n\n## Stale Workflows\n\nIf you are developing Workflows and finding that code isn't executing as expected, the first place to look is whether old Workflows are still running.\n\nIf those old Workflows have the same name and are on the same task queue, Temporal will try to continue executing them on your new code by design.\nYou may get errors that make no sense to you because\n\n- Temporal is trying to execute old Workflow code that no longer exists in your codebase, or\n- your new Client code is expecting Temporal to execute old Workflow/Activity code it doesn't yet know about.\n\nThe biggest sign that this is happening is if you notice Temporal is acting non-deterministically: running the same Workflow twice gets different results.\n\nStale workflows are usually a non-issue because the errors generated are just noise from code you no longer want to run.\nIf you need to terminate old stale Workflows, you can do so with Temporal Web or `tctl`.\n\n## Workflow/Activity registration errors\n\n**If your Workflows or Activities are not imported or spelled correctly**, here are some errors we've seen:\n\n- `ApplicationFailure: 'MyFunction' is not a function`\n- `Workflow did not register a handler for MyQuery`\n\nDouble check that your Workers are registering the right Workflow and Activity Definitions (function names) on the right Task Queues.\n\n**If you are running Temporal in a monorepo**, then your `node_modules` may be in a different location than where Temporal expects to find it by default, which results in errors like:\n\n```bash\n[ERROR] Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@temporalio/workflow/lib/worker-interface.js' in '/src'\n```\n\nOur [Next.js tutorial](/typescript/nextjs-tutorial) is written for people setting up Temporal **within an existing monorepo** which may be of use here.\n\nWhen you pass a `workflowsPath`, our Webpack config expects to find `node_modules` in the same or a parent/ancestor directory.\n\n**If you are custom bundling your own Workflows** you may get errors like these:\n\n```bash\n[ERROR] Failed to activate workflow {\n  runId: 'aaf84a83-51ce-462a-9ab7-6a641a703bff',\n  error: ReferenceError: exports is not defined,\n  workflowExists: false\n}\n```\n\nTemporal Workflow Bundles need to [export a set of methods that fit the compiled `worker-interface.ts` from `@temporalio/workflow`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/eaa2d205c9bc5ff4a3b17c0b34f2dcf6b1e0264a/packages/worker/src/workflow/bundler.ts#L81) as an entry point.\nWe do offer a [bundleWorkflowCode](/typescript/workers/#prebuilt-workflow-bundles) method to assist you with this, though it uses our Webpack settings.\n\n## Webpack errors\n\nThe TypeScript SDK's [Worker](/typescript/workers) bundles Workflows based on `workflowsPath` with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and run them inside v8 isolates.\n\nIf Webpack fails to create the bundle, the SDK will throw an error and emit webpack logs using the SDK's [logger](/typescript/logging#logs-generated-by-sdk-components).\n\nIf you do not see Webpack output in your terminal make sure that you have not disabled SDK logging (see reference to `Runtime.install()` in the link above).\n\n**A common mistake for newcomers to the TypeScript SDK is trying to use Node.js built-ins and modules in their Workflow code.** Usually, the best thing to do is move that code to an Activity.\n\nSome common examples that will **not** work in the Workflow isolate:\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nImporting node built-in modules\n</summary>\n\n:::danger Antipattern\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\n\nconst config = fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf8');\n```\n\n:::\n\nThis is invalid because reading from the filesystem is a non-deterministic operation: the file may change from the time of the original Workflow Execution to when the Workflow is replayed.\n\nYou'll typically see an error in this form in the Webpack output:\n\n```\n2021-10-14T19:22:00.606Z [INFO] Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'fs' in '/Users/you/your-project/src'\n2021-10-14T19:22:00.606Z [INFO] resolve 'fs' in

order make network calls and reading from the filesystem, operations which are non-deterministic by nature because they rely on external state.\nTemporal records Activity results in the Workflow

You can read the CLI docs on:\n\n- [Restarting and resetting Workflows by ID](/tctl-v1)\n- [Resetting all Workflows by binary checksum identifier](/tctl-v1)\n\nIf you need to reset programmatically, the TS SDK does not have any high level APIs for this, but you can make raw gRPC calls to [resetWorkflowExecution](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/proto.temporal.api.workflowservice.v1.workflowservice-1/#resetworkflowexecution).\n\nResetting should only be used to deal with serious logical bugs in your code: it's not for handling transient failures, like a downstream service being unreachable. It should not be used in the course of normal application flows.\n\n## gRPC call timeouts (context deadline exceeded)\n\nThe opaque `context deadline exceeded` error comes from `gRPC`:\n\n```\nError: 4 DEADLINE_EXCEEDED: context deadline exceeded\n    at Object.callErrorFromStatus (/Users/swyx/Work/Temporal/samples-typescript/nextjs-oneclick/node_modules/@grpc/grpc-js/build/src/call.js:31:26)\n    at Object.onReceiveStatus (/Users/swyx/Work/Temporal/samples-typescript/nextjs-oneclick/node_modules/@grpc/grpc-js/build/src/client.js:179:52)\n    at Object.onReceiveStatus (/Users/swyx/Work/Temporal/samples-typescript/nextjs-oneclick/node_modules/@grpc/grpc-js/build/src/client-interceptors.js:336:141)\n    at Object.onReceiveStatus (/Users/swyx/Work/Temporal/samples-typescript/nextjs-oneclick/node_modules/@grpc/grpc-js/build/src/client-interceptors.js:299:181)\n    at /Users/swyx/Work/Temporal/samples-typescript/nextjs-oneclick/node_modules/@grpc/grpc-js/build/src/call-stream.js:145:78\n    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:78:11) {\n  code: 4,\n  details: 'context deadline exceeded',\n  metadata: Metadata {\n    internalRepr: Map(1) { 'content-type' => [Array] },\n    options: {}\n  },\n  page: '/api/getBuyState'\n}\n```\n\nSeveral conditions can cause this error, including network hiccups, timeouts that are too short, and an overloaded server.\nQuerying a Workflow Execution whose query handler causes an error can result in the query call timing out.\n\nSome troubleshooting actions you can take:\n\n- Verify the connection from your Worker to the Temporal Server is working and doesn't have unusually high latency\n- If you are running Temporal Server yourself, check your [server metrics](/server/production-deployment/#scaling-and-metrics) to ensure it's not overloaded\n- If what's timing out is a query, check the logs of your Workers to see if they are having issues handling the query\n\nIf none of the preceding actions help you discover why timeouts are occurring, please try to produce a minimal repro and we'll be glad to help.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"workers.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/workers.md","id":"typescript/workers","title":"Workers and Task Queues in TypeScript","description":"A Worker is a process that connects to the Temporal Server, polls Task Queues for Commands sent from Clients, and executes Workflows and Activities in response to those Commands.","label":"Workers","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n**`@temporalio/worker`** [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@temporalio/worker)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@temporalio/worker) [API reference](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/worker) | [GitHub](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/tree/main/packages/worker)\n\n> _Background reading: [Workers in Temporal](/workers)_\n\n## What is a Worker?\n\nA Worker is a process that connects to the Temporal Server, polls **Task Queues** for Tasks sent from Clients, and executes [Workflows](/typescript/workflows) and [Activities](/typescript/activities) in response.\n\n- **Workers host Workflows and Activities.**\n  - TypeScript SDK Workers bundle Workflows based on `workflowsPath` with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and run them inside v8 isolates.\n  - TypeScript SDK Workers directly run `activities` inside the normal Node.js environment.\n- **Workers are extremely scalable.**\n  - Workers connect to the Temporal Server, poll their configured **Task Queue** for Tasks, execute chunks of code in response to those Tasks, and then communicate the results back.\n  - Workers are distinct from Clients and scaled independently of Temporal Server, which has its own internal services to scale.\n  - Workers are stateless, and can be brought up and down at any time with no Temporal data loss impact.\n    To migrate to new versions of your Workflows and Activities, you restart your Workers with the new versions (and optionally use [the `patch` API to migrate](/typescript/patching) still-running Workflows of the older version).\n  - Use the `@temporalio/worker` package's [`Worker`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker) class to create and run as many Workers as your use case demands, across any number of hosts.\n- **Workers are run on user-controlled hosts.** This is an important security feature which means Temporal Server (or Temporal Cloud) never executes your Workflow or Activity code, and that Workers can have different hardware (e.g. custom GPUs for Machine Learning) than the rest of the system.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nYour Workflows will only progress if there are Workers polling the right Task Queues, and they must have the right Workflows and Activities registered to execute those Tasks.\n</summary>\n\nThe TypeScript SDK uses TypeScript, but cannot completely protect you from typos.\nIf you are experiencing issues, you can check the status of Workers and the Task Queues they poll with [tctl](/tctl-v1) or the [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui).\n\n![Temporal Web Task Queues view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/126413160-18663430-bb7a-4d3a-874e-80598e1fa07d.png)\n\n</details>\n\n### How to develop a Worker\n\nSee the [How to develop a Worker](/application-development/foundations?lang=typescript#run-worker-processes) in the Developer's guide.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nThe Worker package embeds the <a href=\"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core\">Temporal Rust Core SDK</a>.\nIt comes pre-compiled for most installations.\n</summary>\n\nWe've provided pre-compiled binaries for:\n\n- Mac with an Intel chip: `x86_64-apple-darwin`\n- Mac with an Apple chip: `aarch64-apple-darwin`\n- Linux with x86_64 architecture: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`\n- Linux with aarch64 architecture: `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`\n- Windows with x86_64 architecture: `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` (Windows is not yet supported but it is a [priority for us](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/12)).\n\nIf you need to compile the Worker yourself, set up the Rust toolchain by following the instructions [here](https://rustup.rs/).\n\n</details>\n\n### Prebuilt Workflow Bundles\n\nAdvanced users can pass a prebuilt bundle instead of `workflowsPath`, or you can use Temporal's `bundleWorkflowCode` helper:\n\n```ts\nimport { bundleWorkflowCode, Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';\n\n// Option 1: passing path to prebuilt bundle\nconst worker = await Worker.create({\n  taskQueue,\n  workflowBundle: {\n    codePath: './path-to-bundle.js',\n    sourceMapPath: './path-to-bundle.js.map',\n  },\n});\n\n// Option 2: bundling code using Temporal's bundler settings\nconst workflowBundle = await bundleWorkflowCode({\n  workflowsPath: require.resolve('./path-to-your-workflows'),\n});\nconst worker = await Worker.create({\n  taskQueue,\n  workflowBundle,\n});\n```\n\n### How to shut down a Worker and track its state\n\nWorkers shut down if they receive any of these [`shutdownSignals`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions/#shutdownsignals): `['SIGINT', 'SIGTERM', 'SIGQUIT', 'SIGUSR2']`. In development, we shut down Workers with `Ctrl-C` (`SIGINT`) or [`nodemon`](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/c37bae3ea235d1b6956fcbe805478aa46af973ce/hello-world/package.json#L10) (`SIGUSR2`). In production, we usually want to give Workers a [`shutdownGraceTime`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions/#shutdowngracetime) long enough for them to finish any in-progress Activities. As soon as they receive a shutdown signal or request, the Worker stops polling for new Tasks and allows in-flight Tasks to complete until `shutdownGraceTime` is reached. Any Activities that are still running at that time will stop running, and will be rescheduled by Temporal Server when an [Activity timeout](/typescript/activities#activity-timeouts) occurs.\n\nWe may want to programmatically shut down Workers (with `worker.shutdown()`) in integration tests or when automating a fleet of Workers.\n\n#### Worker states\n\nAt any point in time, we can Query Worker state with `worker.getState()`.\nA Worker is in one of 7 states at any given point:\n\n- `INITIALIZED` - The initial state of the Worker after calling Worker.create and successful connection to the server\n- `RUNNING` - `worker.run()` was called, polling Task Queues\n- `FAILED` - Worker encountered an unrecoverable error, `worker.run()` should reject with the error\n- The last 4 states are related to the Worker shutdown process:\n  - `STOPPING` - `worker.shutdown()` was called or received shutdown Signal, Worker will forcefully shutdown after `shutdownGraceTime`\n  - `DRAINING` - Core has indicated that shutdown is complete and all Workflow tasks have been drained, waiting for activities and cached Workflows eviction\n  - `DRAINED` - All activities and Workflows have completed, ready to shutdown\n  - `STOPPED` - Shutdown complete, `worker.run()` resolves\n\nIf you need even more visibility into internal Worker state, [see the API reference for more](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker).\n\n## Rust Core and Worker Networking\n\nIn development, the TypeScript SDK usually handles all of the communication between the Worker and the Temporal Server behind the scenes.\n\nIn production settings, you can configure the `address` and `namespace` the Worker speaks to via [the Rust Core SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core) [`NativeConnection`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.NativeConnection/), and configure the Core [`Runtime`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Runtime/#install) with [RuntimeOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.RuntimeOptions):\n\n```js\nimport {\n  DefaultLogger,\n  NativeConnection,\n  Runtime,\n  Worker,\n} from '@temporalio/worker';\n\nconst logger = new DefaultLogger('DEBUG');\nRuntime.install({\n  logger,\n  telemetryOptions: { logForwardingLevel: 'INFO' },\n});\nconst connection = await NativeConnection.connect({\n  address: 'temporal.myorg.io',\n});\nconst worker = await Worker.create({\n  connection,\n  namespace: 'your-custom-namespace',\n  /* standard Worker options from here */\n});\n```\n\nTemporal also supports mTLS encryption (required by Temporal Cloud) this way - please read our [Security docs](/typescript/security#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls) for more information.\n\n## Task Queues\n\nimport WhatIsATaskQueue from '../concepts/what-is-a-task-queue.md'\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nA Task Queue is a dynamic queue in Temporal Server polled by one or more Workers.\n</summary>\n\n<WhatIsATaskQueue />\n\n</details>\n\n### Where Task Queues are used\n\nIn Temporal, a Task Queue is represented in code by its name as a `string`.\n\nThere are two main places where the name of the Task Queue is supplied by the developer.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\n\nWhen scheduling a Workflow, a `taskQueue` must be specified.\n\n</summary>\n\n```ts\nimport { Connection, WorkflowClient } from '@temporalio/client';\nconst connection = await Connection.connect();\nconst client = new WorkflowClient({ connection });\nconst result = await client.execute(yourWorkflow, {\n  // required\n  taskQueue: 'testhttp',\n  workflowId: 'business-meaningful-id',\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\n\nWhen creating a Worker, you **must** pass the `taskQueue` option to the [`Worker.create()` function](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker#create).\n\n</summary>\n\n```ts\nconst worker = await Worker.create({\n  // imported elsewhere\n  activities,\n  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\nOptionally, in Workflow code, when calling an Activity, you can specify the Task Queue by passing the `taskQueue` option to [`proxyActivities()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#proxyActivities) or [`startChild/executeChild`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#startchild).\nIf you do not specify a `taskQueue`, then the TypeScript SDK places Activity and Child Workflow Tasks in the same Task Queue as the Workflow Task Queue.\n\n### Example: Sticky Activities\n\nAny Worker that polls a Task Queue is allowed to pick up the next task; sometimes this is undesirable because you want tasks to execute sequentially on the same machine.\n\nFortunately, there is a design pattern for this we call _Sticky Activities_.\nBecause Task Queues are dynamically created and very lightweight, you can use them for task routing by creating a new Task Queue per machine.\n\nThe main strategy is:\n\n1. Create a `getUniqueTaskQueue` Activity that generates a unique Task Queue name, (for example, `uniqueWorkerTaskQueue`).\n   It doesn't matter where this Activity is run so this can be \"non sticky\" as per Temporal default behavior\n2. For Activities intended to be _sticky_, register them in one Worker, and have that be the only Worker listening on that `uniqueWorkerTaskQueue`.\n   - Multiple Workers can be created inside the same process.\n3. Execute Workflows from the Client like normal.\n   - Activities will execute in sequence on the same machine because they are all routed by the `uniqueWorkerTaskQueue`.\n\nWorkflow Code:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-sticky-queues-workflow-->\n\n[activities-sticky-queues/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/activities-sticky-queues/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nconst { getUniqueTaskQueue } = proxyActivities<\n  ReturnType<typeof createNonStickyActivities>\n>({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',\n});\n\nexport async function fileProcessingWorkflow(maxAttempts = 5): Promise<void> {\n  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; ++attempt) {\n    try {\n      const uniqueWorkerTaskQueue = await getUniqueTaskQueue();\n      const activities = proxyActivities<\n        ReturnType<typeof createStickyActivities>\n      >({\n        taskQueue: uniqueWorkerTaskQueue,\n        // Note the use of scheduleToCloseTimeout.\n        // The reason this timeout type is used is because this task queue is unique\n        // to a single worker.

reference](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow) | [GitHub](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/tree/main/packages/workflow)\n\n> _Background reading: [Workflows in Temporal](/workflows)_\n\n**Workflows are async functions that can orchestrate Activities and access special Workflow APIs, subject to deterministic limitations**.\n\nEach Workflow function has two parts:\n\n- The function name is known as the **Workflow Type**.\n- The function implementation code (body) is known as the **Workflow Definition**.\n\nEach Workflow Definition is bundled with any third party dependencies, and registered by Workflow Type in a [Worker](/typescript/workers).\nA Workflow function becomes a **Workflow Execution** (instance) only when started from a [**Workflow Client**](/typescript/clients) using its Workflow Type.\n\n<!-- todo: we need a diagram here to show the relationship -->\n\n## How to write a Workflow function\n\nWorkflow Definitions are \"just functions\", which can store state, and orchestrate [Activity functions](/typescript/activities).\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-hello-workflow {\"enable_source_link\": false}-->\n\n```ts\nimport { proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n// Only import the activity types\nimport type * as activities from './activities';\n\nconst { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',\n});\n\n/** A workflow that simply calls an activity */\nexport async function example(name: string): Promise<string> {\n  return await greet(name);\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nThe snippet above uses `proxyActivities` to create functions that, when called, schedule a `greet` Activity in the system to say \"Hello World\".\n\nA Workflow function can have multiple parameters, but we encourage you to use a single object parameter, as that helps with backward compatibility:\n\n```ts\ntype ExampleArgs = {\n  name: string;\n};\n\nexport async function example(\n  args: ExampleArgs,\n): Promise<{ greeting: string }> {\n  const greeting = await greet(args.name);\n  return { greeting };\n}\n```\n\n### Workflow Limitations\n\nWorkflow code must be [deterministic](/typescript/determinism), and the TypeScript SDK replaces common sources of non-determinism for you, like `Date.now()`, `Math.random`, and `setTimeout` (we recommend using our [`sleep`](/typescript/workflows#sleep) API instead).\nHowever, there are other important limitations:\n\n- No Node built-ins like `process` or the `path` and `fs` modules\n- No filesystem access\n- No network access\n\nThese constraints don't apply inside Activities.\n**If you need to ping an API, or access the filesystem (e.g. for building a CI/CD system), move that code into Activities.**\n\n## How to Start and Cancel Workflows\n\nSee the [TypeScript SDK Client docs](/typescript/clients) for how to use `WorkflowHandle`s to start, cancel, signal, query, describe and more.\n\n### Workflow Options\n\nWorkflows have options that determine what Task Queue they run on, what Search Attributes they are tagged with, Cron schedule, and more, but they are only set in the Temporal Client call (i.e. when you start or execute a Workflow) rather than _inside_ the Workflow code itself.\n\nPlease see the [Temporal Client docs](/typescript/clients) or the [API Reference](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowOptions) for more info on Workflow Options.\n\n## Workflow APIs\n\nThe `@temporalio/workflow` package exports all the useful primitives that you can use in Workflows.

libraries.\nIf you do, please [get in touch on Slack](https://temporal.io/slack), we would love to work with you and promote your work.\n\nThe rest of this document explains the major Workflow APIs you should know:\n\n- Signals and Queries: `defineSignal`, `defineQuery`, and `setHandler`\n- Deferred Execution: `sleep` and `condition`\n- Child Workflows: `startChild` and `executeChild`\n- Entity (indefinitely long-running) Workflows: `continueAsNew`\n\n## Signals and Queries\n\n> _Background reading: [Signals and Queries in Temporal](/workflows/#signals)_\n\n<RelatedReadContainer>\n  <RelatedReadItem page={WhatIsASignal} />\n  <RelatedReadItem page={WhatIsAQuery} />\n</RelatedReadContainer>\n\n#### How to define and receive Signals and Queries\n\n### Define Signals and Queries inside a Workflow\n\n- To add a Signal to a Workflow, call [`defineSignal`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#definesignal) with a name, and then attach a listener with `setHandler`.\n- To add a Query to a Workflow, call [`defineQuery`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#definequery) with a name, and then attach a listener with `setHandler`.\n- Handlers for both Signals and Queries can take arguments, which can be used inside `setHandler` logic.\n- Only Signal Handlers can mutate state, and only Query Handlers can return values.\n\n#### Define Signals and Queries Statically\n\nIf you know the name of your signals and queries upfront, we recommend declaring them outside of the Workflow Definition.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-blocked-workflow-->\n\n[signals-queries/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/signals-queries/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport const unblockSignal = wf.defineSignal('unblock');\nexport const isBlockedQuery = wf.defineQuery<boolean>('isBlocked');\n\nexport async function unblockOrCancel(): Promise<void> {\n  let isBlocked = true;\n  wf.setHandler(unblockSignal, () => void (isBlocked = false));\n  wf.setHandler(isBlockedQuery, () => isBlocked);\n  console.log('Blocked');\n  try {\n    await wf.condition(() => !isBlocked);\n    console.log('Unblocked');\n  } catch (err) {\n    if (err instanceof wf.CancelledFailure) {\n      console.log('Cancelled');\n    }\n    throw err;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nThis helps provide type safety, since you can export the type signature of the signal or query to be called on the clientside.\n\n#### Define Signals and Queries Dynamically\n\nFor more flexible usecases, you may want a dynamic Signal (such as a generated ID).\nYou may handle it in two ways:\n\n- avoid making it dynamic by collapsing all signals in one handler and move the ID to the payload, or\n- actually make the Signal name dynamic by inlining the Signal definition per handler.\n\n```ts\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\n// \"fat handler\" solution\nwf.setHandler(`genericSignal`, (payload) => {\n  switch (payload.taskId) {\n    case taskAId:\n      // do task A things\n      break;\n    case taskBId:\n      // do task B things\n      break;\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Unexpected task.');\n  }\n});\n\n// \"inline definition\" solution\nwf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(`task-${taskAId}`), (payload) => {\n  /* do task A things */\n});\nwf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(`task-${taskBId}`), (payload) => {\n  /* do task B things */\n});\n\n// utility \"inline definition\" helper\nconst inlineSignal = (signalName, handler) =>\n  wf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(signalName), handler);\ninlineSignal(`task-${taskBId}`, (payload) => {\n  /* do task B things */\n});\n```\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    API Design FAQs\n  </summary>\n\n#### Why not `new Signal` and `new Query`?\n\nThe semantic of `defineSignal`/`defineQuery` is intentional, in that they return Signal/Query **Definitions**, not unique instances of Signals and Queries themselves. [This is their entire source code](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/fc658d3760e6653aec47732ab17a0062b7dd23fc/packages/workflow/src/workflow.ts#L884-L907):\n\n```ts\n/**\n * Define a signal method for a Workflow.\n */\nexport function defineSignal<Args extends any[] = []>(\n  name: string,\n): SignalDefinition<Args> {\n  return {\n    type: 'signal',\n    name,\n  };\n}\n\n/**\n * Define a query method for a Workflow.\n */\nexport function defineQuery<Ret, Args extends any[] = []>(\n  name: string,\n): QueryDefinition<Ret, Args> {\n  return {\n    type: 'query',\n    name,\n  };\n}\n```\n\nSignals/Queries are only instantiated in `setHandler` and are specific to a particular Workflow Execution.\n\nThese distinctions may seem minor, but they model how Temporal works under the hood, because Signals and Queries are messages identified by \"just strings\" and don't have meaning independent of the Workflow having a listener to handle them.\nThis will be clearer if you refer to the Client-side APIs below.\n\n#### Why `setHandler` and not OTHER_API?\n\nWe named it `setHandler` instead of `subscribe` because Signals/Queries can only have one \"handler\" at a time, whereas `subscribe` could imply an Observable with multiple consumers, and is a higher level construct.\n\n```ts\nwf.setHandler(MySignal, handlerFn1);\nwf.setHandler(MySignal, handlerFn2); // replaces handlerFn1\n```\n\nIf you are familiar with [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), you are free to wrap your Signal and Query into Observables if you wish, or you could dynamically reassign the listener based on your business logic or Workflow state.\n\n</details>\n\n### Invoke Signals and Queries from a Client\n\nSending Signals and making Queries requires having a Workflow handle from a [Temporal Client](/typescript/clients).\n\n- You send a Signal with `handle.signal(signal, ...args)`. A Signal has no return value by definition.\n- You make a Query with `handle.query(query, ...args)`. A Query needs a return value, but can also take args.\n- You can refer to either by string name, which is useful for dynamic reference, but you will lose type inference.\n\n```ts\n// // inside Client code! not Workflow code!\nimport { count, increment } from './workflow';\n\n// init client code omitted - see Client docs\nconst handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);\n\n// these three are equivalent\nawait handle.signal(increment, 1);\nawait handle.signal<[number]>('increment', 1);\nawait client.getHandle(workflowId).signal(increment, 1);\n\n// these three are equivalent\nlet state = await handle.query(count);\nlet state = await handle.query<number>('count');\nlet state = await client.getHandle(workflowId).query(count);\n```\n\nBy design of these Workflow handles, two different Workflows can use the same Signal or Query and there is still no ambiguity, because you always have to specify which Workflow you are signalling (`workflowHandle1.signal(MySignal)` vs `workflowHandle2.signal(MySignal)`).\n\n### Signals and Queries design patterns\n\nBecause Signals and Queries are intentionally flexible, you can wrap them up into reusable functions:\n\n<Tabs\ndefaultValue=\"export\"\nvalues={[\n{label: 'Exportable', value: 'export'},\n{label: 'Concise', value: 'short'},\n]\n}>\n\n<TabItem value=\"export\">\n\n```ts\n// implementation of queryable + signallable State in Workflow file\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nfunction useState<T = any>(name: string, initialValue: T) {\n  const signal = wf.defineSignal<[T]>(name);\n  const query = wf.defineQuery<T>(name);\n  let state: T = initialValue;\n  return {\n    signal,\n    query,\n    get value() {\n      // need to use closure because function doesn't rerun unlike React Hooks\n      return state;\n    },\n    set value(newVal: T) {\n      state = newVal;\n    },\n  };\n}\n\n// usage in Workflow file\nconst store = useState('your-store', 10);\nfunction YourWorkflow() {\n  wf.setHandler(store.signal, (newValue: T) => {\n    // console.log('updating', newValue) // optional but useful for debugging\n    store.value = newValue;\n  });\n  wf.setHandler(store.query, () => store.value);\n  while (true) {\n    console.log('sleeping for ', store.value);\n    wf.sleep(store.value++ * 100); // you can mutate the value as well\n  }\n}\n\n// usage in Client file\nawait handle.signal(store.signal, 30);\nconst storeState = handle.query<number>(store.query); // 30\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value=\"short\">\n\n```ts\n// alternative, more concise but slightly less safe implementation\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflows';\n\nfunction useState<T = any>(name: string, initialValue: T) {\n  const signal = wf.defineSignal<[T]>(name);\n  const query = wf.defineQuery<T>(name);\n  let state: T = initialValue;\n  wf.setHandler(signal, (newVal: T) => void (newVal = state));\n  wf.setHandler(query, () => state);\n  return {\n    signal,\n    query,\n    get value() {\n      return state;\n    },\n    set value(newVal: T) {\n      state = newVal;\n    },\n  };\n}\n\n// usage in Workflow file\nfunction YourWorkflow() {\n  const store = useState('your-store', 10); // needs to be inside because function uses setHandler\n  while (true) {\n    console.log('sleeping for ', store.value);\n    wf.sleep(store.value++ * 100); // you can mutate the value as well\n  }\n}\n\n// usage in Client file\nawait handle.signal('your-store', 30);\nconst storeState = handle.query<number>('your-store'); // 30\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\nYou can even conditionally set handlers, or set handlers inside handlers:\n\n```ts\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';\nfunction YourWorkflow(signallable: boolean, signalNames: string[]) {\n  // conditional setting of handlers\n  if (signallable) {\n    wf.setHandler(MySignal, handler);\n  }\n\n  // set same handler for an array of signals by name\n  signalNames.forEach((name) => wf.setHandler(name, handler));\n\n  // signal handler that sets signal handlers\n  // // would be nice to send a function but we can't because it is not serializable\n  wf.setHandler(MySignal, (handlerName) => {\n    wf.setHandler(handlerName, handlers[handlerName]);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Signals and Queries Notes\n\n#### Type-safety for Signals and Queries\n\nThe Signals and Queries API has been designed with type safety in mind:\n\n- `wf.defineQuery<Ret, Args>(name): QueryDefinition<Ret, Args>`\n- `wf.defineSignal<Args>(name): SignalDefinition<Args>`\n- `handle.query<Ret, Args>(def, ...args): Promise<Ret>`\n- `handle.signal<Args>(def, ...args): Promise<Ret>`\n\nYou can either:\n\n- Define the argument type (and, for Queries, the return type) up front and import it for type inference with the `WorkflowHandle`\n- Define the expected type at the call site when you invoke the Signal/Query.\n\n```ts\nconst increment = wf.defineSignal<[number /* more args can be added here */]>(\n  'increment',\n);\nconst count = wf.defineQuery<number /*, Arg[] can be added here */>('count');\n\n// type safety inferred from definitions\nawait handle.signal(increment, 1);\nawait handle.signal(increment); // Expected 2 arguments, but got 1.\nawait handle.signal(increment, '1'); // Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'\n\n// common problems when you lack type safety\nawait handle.signal('increment'); // No TS error but insufficient arguments\nawait handle.signal('increment', '1'); // No TS error but sending in wrong type\n\n// add type safety at callsite\nawait handle.signal<[number]>('increment'); // Expected 2 arguments, but got 1.\nlet state = await handle.query<number, [string]>('print', 'Count: ');\n```\n\n#### Notes on Signals\n\n- Signal handlers are only guaranteed to be called in order **per Signal Type**, not across all of them.\n  If you need strict ordering across multiple Signals, either:\n  - Combine them into one Signal Type and use a `switch` statement.\n  - Register handlers statically (call `setHandler` outside of the Workflow function).\n- `WorkflowHandle.signal` resolves as soon as Temporal Server has persisted the Signal, before the Workflow's Signal handler is called.\n- `WorkflowHandle.signal` Promise resolves with no value; **Signal handlers cannot return data to the caller.**\n- **No Synchronous Updates**.\n  Users often want Signals to return a value, for example, a validation error.\n  However Temporal has no way to surface any error to the external invocation.\n  Signals are always asynchronous, in other words, **a Signal always succeeds**.\n  Long term, the solution to this is \"Synchronous Update\" and [it is under active development](https://github.com/temporalio/proposals/pull/53).\n\nFor now [the best workaround](https://community.temporal.io/t/signalling-system-human-driven-workflows/160/2) is to use a Query to return Workflow state after signaling.\nTemporal guarantees read-after-write consistency of Signals-followed-by-Queries.\n\n#### Notes on Queries\n\n> 🚨 WARNING: NEVER mutate Workflow state inside a query! Generating Commands in Query handlers can lead to unexpected behaviors on subsequent executions.\n\n:::danger How NOT to write a Query\n\nThis mutates Workflow state - do not do this:\n\n```ts\nexport function badExample() {\n  let someState = 123;\n  wf.setHandler(query, () => {\n    return someState++; // bad! don't do this!\n  });\n}\n```\n\n:::\n\n#### Reusing Signals and Queries in Libraries\n\nBecause Signal and Query Definitions are separate from Workflow Definitions, we can now compose them together:\n\n```ts\n// basic reusable Workflow component\nexport async function unblocked() {\n  let isBlocked = true;\n  wf.setHandler(unblockSignal, () => (isBlocked = false));\n  wf.setHandler(isBlockedQuery, () => isBlocked);\n  await wf.condition(() => !isBlocked);\n}\n\n// usage: signals can be sent to each Workflow separately\nexport async function yourWorkflow1() {\n  await unblocked();\n}\nexport async function yourWorkflow2() {\n  await unblocked();\n}\n```\n\nAnother example of componentization can be found in our [code samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/854c78955601a6b63aa8ea412cfb5eaf61bd78ee/expense/src/workflows.ts#L19).\n\n### `signalWithStart`\n\nIf you're not sure if a Workflow is running, you can `signalWithStart` a Workflow to send it a Signal and optionally start the Workflow if it is not running.\nArguments for both are sent as needed.\n\n```ts\n// Signal With Start in Client file\nconst client = new WorkflowClient();\nawait client.signalWithStart(YourWorkflow, {\n  workflowId,\n  args: [arg1, arg2],\n  signal: MySignal,\n  signalArgs: [arg3, arg4],\n});\n```\n\nSee the [Workflow Client](/typescript/clients/#workflow-options) docs for more notes on how starting Workflows and Workflow Options look like.\n\n## Deferred Execution\n\n`sleep` and `condition` help you write durable asynchronous code in Temporal by offering an easy to use Promise-like API, but deferring, persisting, and resuming execution behind the scenes.\n\n- In other words, they do not \"lock\" the process, allowing one Worker to concurrently process hundreds of Workflows that sleep and await arbitrary conditions.\n- They are also \"cancellation aware\", allowing for graceful cleanup if the Workflow they are linked to is canceled.\n  For more information, see [Cancellation Scopes](/typescript/cancellation-scopes).\n\nThe Workflow's V8 isolate environment completely replaces the JavaScript [`setTimeout`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#timers) global, including inside libraries that you use, to provide a complete JavaScript runtime.\nWe recommend using our [`sleep(timeout)`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#sleep) API instead, because it is a cancellation-aware Promise wrapper for `setTimeout`.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhy Durable Timers Are a Hard Problem\n</summary>\n\nJavaScript has a `setTimeout`, which seems relatively straightforward.\nHowever, they are held in memory - if your system goes down, those timers are gone.\n\nA lot of careful code is required to make these timeouts fully reliable (aka recoverable in case of outage) and cancellation aware.\n\n<!-- Note: these are rough Durable Timer notes from Maxim - we should build out examples and really hit home why you want to use us rather than write your own, in future.\nWhen writing Workflows with timers, you need to take care that it handles jumps of time.\nWhat we mean by \"handling jumps\": if you had timers that were supposed to go off at 1.15, 1.30, and 1.45pm, and your system goes down from 1pm to 2pm, then at 2pm when the system comes back up all 3 timers will fire at once. If your workflow code relies on the timers resolving in precise order, write these checks yourself.\n-->\n\nBeyond that, further engineering is needed to scale this - imagine 100,000 independently running timers in your system, firing every minute.\nThat is the kind of scale Temporal handles.\n\n</details>\n\n### `sleep`\n\n`sleep` sets a durable timer for a fixed time period (an \"Updatable Timer\" pattern is documented below).\nIt uses the [ms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms) package to take either a string or number of milliseconds, and returns a promise that you can `await` and `catch` when the Workflow Execution is cancelled.\n\n```ts\nimport { sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nawait sleep('30 days'); // string API\nawait sleep(30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // numerical API\n\n// `sleep` is cancellation-aware\n// when workflow gets canceled during sleep, promise is rejected\nawait sleep('30 days').catch(() => {\n  // clean up code if workflow is canceled during sleep\n});\n\n// NOT VALID\nawait sleep('1 month'); // ms package doesnt support \"months\" https://github.com/vercel/ms/issues/57\n// use date-fns and sleepUntil instead, see below\n```\n\nWith this primitive, you can build other abstractions. For example, a `sleepUntil` function that converts absolute time to relative time with `date-fns`:\n\n```ts\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';\nimport differenceInMilliseconds from 'date-fns/differenceInMilliseconds';\n\nasync function sleepUntil(futureDate, fromDate = new Date()) {\n  const timeUntilDate = differenceInMilliseconds(\n    new Date(futureDate),\n    fromDate,\n  );\n  return wf.sleep(timeUntilDate);\n}\n\nsleepUntil('30 Sep ' + (new Date().getFullYear() + 1)); // wake up when September ends\nsleepUntil('5 Nov 2022 00:12:34 GMT'); // wake up at specific time and timezone\n```\n\nYou can check the valid ISO string formats on [MDN's Date docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse). The upcoming [ECMAScript Temporal API](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/index.html) will offer more time utilities natively in JavaScript, alongside unfortunate name collision for Temporal developers.\n\n:::caution Preventing Confusion: Workflow sleep vs Activity sleep\n\nThere is an unrelated [`sleep` utility function](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Context/#sleep) available in **Activity Context** that is not durable, but is cancellation aware. See [the Activities docs for details](/typescript/activities).\n\n:::\n\n### `condition`\n\nThe `condition(fn, timeout?)` API returns a promise that resolves:\n\n- `true` when the given predicate function (**must be synchronous**) returns `true` or\n- (optional) `false` if a timeout (given as a string or number of milliseconds) happens first.\n\nThis API is comparable to `Workflow.await` in other SDKs and often used to wait for Signals, since Signals are the main way to asynchronously update internal Workflow state (looped Activities are another).\n\nThe timeout also uses the [ms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms) package to take either a string or number of milliseconds.\n\n```ts\n// type signature\nexport function condition(\n  fn: () => boolean,\n  timeout: number | string,\n): Promise<boolean>;\nexport function condition(fn: () => boolean): Promise<void>;\n\n// Usage\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nlet x = 0;\n// do stuff with x, eg increment every time you receive a signal\nawait wf.condition(() => x > 3);\n// you only reach here when x > 3\n\n// await either x > 3 or 30 minute timeout, whichever comes first\nif (await wf.condition(() => x > 3, '30 mins')) {\n  // reach here if predicate true\n} else {\n  // reach here if timed out\n}\n\n// track user progress with condition\nexport async function trackStepChanges(): Promise<void> {\n  let step = 0;\n  wf.setHandler(updateStep, (s) => void (step = s));\n  wf.setHandler(getStep, () => step);\n  await wf.condition(() => step === 1);\n  await wf.condition(() => step === 2);\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Example usage in our Next.js One-Click Buy code sample</summary>\n\n`condition` only returns true when the function evaluates to `true`; if the `condition` resolves as `false`, then a timeout has occurred.\nThis leads to some nice patterns, like placing `await condition` inside an `if`:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-oneclick-buy-->\n\n[nextjs-ecommerce-oneclick/temporal/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/nextjs-ecommerce-oneclick/temporal/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nexport async function OneClickBuy(itemId: string) {\n  const itemToBuy = itemId;\n  let purchaseState: PurchaseState = 'PURCHASE_PENDING';\n  wf.setHandler(\n    cancelPurchase,\n    () => void (purchaseState = 'PURCHASE_CANCELED'),\n  );\n  wf.setHandler(purchaseStateQuery, () => purchaseState);\n  if (await wf.condition(() => purchaseState === 'PURCHASE_CANCELED', '5s')) {\n    return await canceledPurchase(itemToBuy);\n  } else {\n    purchaseState = 'PURCHASE_CONFIRMED';\n    return await checkoutItem(itemToBuy);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n</details>\n\n:::warning `condition` Antipatterns\n\n- No time based condition functions are allowed in your function as this is very error prone.\n  Use the optional `timeout` arg or a `sleep` timer.\n- `condition` only accepts **synchronous** functions that return a boolean.\n  Do not put async functions, like Activities, inside the `condition` function.\n\n:::\n\n<!--TODO: give an idea of what the bad code looks like and why its bad-->\n\n### Async design patterns\n\nThe real value of `sleep` and `condition` is in knowing how to use them to model asynchronous business logic.\nHere are some examples we use the most; we welcome more if you can think of them!\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nRacing Timers\n</summary>\n\nUse `Promise.race` with Timers to dynamically adjust delays.\n\n```ts\nexport async function processOrderWorkflow({\n  orderProcessingMS,\n  sendDelayedEmailTimeoutMS,\n}: ProcessOrderOptions): Promise<void> {\n  let processing = true;\n  const processOrderPromise = processOrder(orderProcessingMS).then(() => {\n    processing = false;\n  });\n\n  await Promise.race([processOrderPromise, sleep(sendDelayedEmailTimeoutMS)]);\n\n  if (processing) {\n    await sendNotificationEmail();\n    await processOrderPromise;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\nRacing Signals\n</summary>\n\nUse `Promise.race` with Signals and Triggers to have a promise resolve at the earlier of either system time or human intervention.\n\n```ts\nimport { defineSignal, sleep, Trigger } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nconst userInteraction = new Trigger<boolean>();\nconst completeUserInteraction = defineSignal('completeUserInteraction');\n\nexport async function yourWorkflow(userId: string) {\n  setHandler(completeUserInteraction, () => userInteraction.resolve(true)); // programmatic resolve\n  const userInteracted = await Promise.race([\n    userInteraction,\n    sleep('30 days'),\n  ]);\n  if (!userInteracted) {\n    await sendReminderEmail(userId);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can invert this to create a Reminder pattern where the promise resolves IF no Signal is received.\n\n:::warning Antipattern: Racing sleep.then\n\nBe careful when racing a chained `sleep`. This may cause bugs because the chained `.then` will still continue to execute.\n\n```js\nawait Promise.race([\n  sleep('5s').then(() => (status = 'timed_out')),\n  somethingElse.then(() => (status = 'processed')),\n]);\n\nif (status === 'processed') await complete(); // takes more than 5 seconds\n// status = timed_out\n```\n\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nUpdatable Timer\n</summary>\n\nHere is how you can build an updatable timer with `condition`:\n\n```ts\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\n// usage\nexport async function countdownWorkflow(): Promise<void> {\n  const target = Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 day!!!\n  const timer = new UpdatableTimer(target);\n  console.log('timer set for: ' + new Date(target).toString());\n  wf.setHandler(setDeadlineSignal, (deadline) => {\n    // send in new deadlines via Signal\n    timer.deadline = deadline;\n    console.log('timer now set for: ' + new Date(deadline).toString());\n  });\n  wf.setHandler(timeLeftQuery, () => timer.deadline - Date.now());\n  await timer; // if you send in a signal with a new time, this timer will resolve earlier!\n  console.log('countdown done!');\n}\n```\n\nThis is available in the third party [`temporal-time-utils`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/temporal-time-utils#user-content-updatabletimer) package where you can also see the implementation:\n\n```ts\n// implementation\nexport class UpdatableTimer implements PromiseLike<void> {\n  deadlineUpdated = false;\n  #deadline: number;\n\n  constructor(deadline: number) {\n    this.#deadline = deadline;\n  }\n\n  private async run(): Promise<void> {\n    /* eslint-disable no-constant-condition */\n    while (true) {\n      this.deadlineUpdated = false;\n      if (\n        !(await wf.condition(\n          () => this.deadlineUpdated,\n          this.#deadline - Date.now(),\n        ))\n      ) {\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  then<TResult1 = void, TResult2 = never>(\n    onfulfilled?: (value: void) => TResult1 | PromiseLike<TResult1>,\n    onrejected?: (reason: any) => TResult2 | PromiseLike<TResult2>,\n  ): PromiseLike<TResult1 | TResult2> {\n    return this.run().then(onfulfilled, onrejected);\n  }\n\n  set deadline(value: number) {\n    this.#deadline = value;\n    this.deadlineUpdated = true;\n  }\n\n  get deadline(): number {\n    return this.#deadline;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Triggers\n\n[Triggers](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.Trigger) are a Promise-like concept in the TypeScript SDK.\n\nTriggers, like the [`condition()`](#condition) return value and other Promises, can be awaited and expose a `then` method.\nUnlike Promises, they export `resolve` or `reject` methods, so you can programmatically control them.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nTrigger Code Example\n</summary>\n\n```ts\nimport { defineSignal, sleep, Trigger } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nconst userInteraction = new Trigger<boolean>();\nconst completeUserInteraction = defineSignal('completeUserInteraction');\n\nexport async function yourWorkflow(userId: string) {\n  setHandler(completeUserInteraction, () => userInteraction.resolve(true)); // programmatic resolve\n  const userInteracted = await Promise.race([\n    userInteraction,\n    sleep('30 days'),\n  ]);\n  if (!userInteracted) {\n    await sendReminderEmail(userId);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`Trigger` is `CancellationScope`-aware. It is linked to the current scope on construction and throws when that scope is cancelled.\n\n</details>\n\n## Child Workflows\n\nBesides Activities, a Workflow can also start other, \"Child\" Workflows.\nChild Workflows have a subset of APIs from [Temporal Clients](/typescript/clients), including how to start/execute/handle Workflows.\n\n[`startChild`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#startchild) starts a child workflow without awaiting completion, and returns a [`ChildWorkflowHandle`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.ChildWorkflowHandle):\n\n```ts\nimport { startChild } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport async function parentWorkflow(names: string[]) {\n  const childHandle = await startChild(childWorkflow, {\n    args: [name],\n    // workflowId, // add business-meaningful workflow id here\n    // // regular workflow options apply here, with two additions (defaults shown):\n    // cancellationType: ChildWorkflowCancellationType.WAIT_CANCELLATION_COMPLETED,\n    // parentClosePolicy: ParentClosePolicy.PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_TERMINATE\n  });\n  // you can use childHandle to signal or get result here\n  await childHandle.signal('anySignal');\n  const result = childHandle.result();\n  // you can use childHandle to signal, query, cancel, terminate, or get result here\n}\n```\n\nYou should use [cancellationScopes](/typescript/cancellation-scopes) if you need to cancel Child Workflows.\n\n[`executeChild`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#executechild) starts a child workflow and awaits (blocks until) its completion:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-child-workflow-->\n\n[child-workflows/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/child-workflows/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nimport { executeChild } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport async function parentWorkflow(...names: string[]): Promise<string> {\n  const responseArray = await Promise.all(\n    names.map((name) =>\n      executeChild(childWorkflow, {\n        args: [name],\n        // workflowId, // add business-meaningful workflow id here\n        // // regular workflow options apply here, with two additions (defaults shown):\n        // cancellationType: ChildWorkflowCancellationType.WAIT_CANCELLATION_COMPLETED,\n        // parentClosePolicy: ParentClosePolicy.PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_TERMINATE\n      })\n    ),\n  );\n  return responseArray.join('\\n');\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nTo control any running Workflow from inside a Workflow, use [`getExternalWorkflowHandle(workflowId)`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#getexternalworkflowhandle).\n\n```ts\nimport { getExternalWorkflowHandle, workflowInfo } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport async function terminateWorkflow() {\n  const { workflowId } = workflowInfo(); // no await needed\n  const handle = getExternalWorkflowHandle(workflowId); // sync function, not async\n  await handle.cancel();\n}\n```\n\nSpecial Notes:\n\n- Child Workflow options automatically inherit their values from the Parent Workflow options if they are not explicitly set. They have two advanced options unique to Child Workflows:\n  - [`cancellationType`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/enums/proto.coresdk.child_workflow.ChildWorkflowCancellationType): Controls at which point to throw the CanceledFailure exception when a child workflow is cancelled\n  - `parentClosePolicy`: Explained below\n- Child Workflow Executions are [`CancellationScope`](/typescript/cancellation-scopes) aware and will automatically be cancelled when their containing scope is cancelled.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhen to use Child Workflows vs Activities\n</summary>\n\nChild Workflows and Activities are both started from Workflows, so you may feel confused about when to use which.\nHere are some important differences:\n\n- Child Workflows have access to all Workflow APIs, but are subject to [Workflow Limitations](/typescript/workflows#workflow-limitations). Activities have the inverse pros and cons.\n- Child Workflows can continue on if their Parent is canceled, with a [ParentClosePolicy](/concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy/) of `ABANDON`, whereas Activities are _always_ canceled when their Workflow is canceled (they may react to a [cancellationSignal](/typescript/activities#activity-cancellation) for cleanup if canceled). The decision is roughly analogous to spawning a child process in a terminal to do work vs doing work in the same process.\n- Temporal tracks all state changes within Child Workflows in Event History, whereas only the input, output, and retry attempts of Activities are tracked.\n\nActivities usually model a single operation on the external world. Workflows are modeling composite operations that consist of multiple activities or other child workflows.\n\n**When in doubt, use Activities.**\n\n</details>\n\n<RelatedReadList\nreadlist={[\n[\"What is a Child Workflow Execution?\",\"/concepts/what-is-a-child-workflow-execution\",\"explanation\"]\n]}\n/>\n\n### Parent Close Policy\n\nimport PCP from '../concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy.md'\n\n<PCP />\n\n<span id=\"continueasnew\" />\n\n## `continueAsNew`\n\nWe need to call `continueAsNew` before our Workflow hits the 50,000 Event limit. [Events](../concepts/what-is-an-event) are generated when a Workflow does various things involving Temporal Server, including calling an Activity, receiving a Signal, or calling `sleep`, but not handling a Query.\n\n<details>\n<summary>More info</summary>\n\n[What is Continue-As-New?](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new)\n\n</details>\n\n[`continueAsNew`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#continueasnew) stops the current Workflow Execution and starts another one with new arguments and an empty Event History. Note that this is done immediately, so make sure that your Signal handlers have finished running before calling `continueAsNew`.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-continue-as-new-workflow-->\n\n[continue-as-new/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/continue-as-new/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nimport { continueAsNew, sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport async function loopingWorkflow(iteration = 0): Promise<void> {\n  if (iteration === 10) {\n    return;\n  }\n  console.log('Running Workflow iteration:', iteration);\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // Must match the arguments expected by `loopingWorkflow`\n  await continueAsNew<typeof loopingWorkflow>(iteration + 1);\n  // Unreachable code, continueAsNew is like `process.exit` and will stop execution once called.\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nYou can also call `continueAsNew` from a signal handler or `continueAsNew` to a different Workflow (or different Task Queue) using [`makeContinueAsNewFunc`](https://nodejs.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#makecontinueasnewfunc).\n\nIf you need to know whether a Workflow was started via `continueAsNew`, you can pass an optional last argument as true:\n\n```ts\nexport async function loopingWorkflow(foo: any, isContinued?: boolean) {\n  // some logic based on foo, branching on isContinued\n\n  (await continueAsNew)<typeof loopingWorkflow>(foo, true);\n}\n```\n\n### Don't overuse\n\nYou should not try to call `continueAsNew` too often - if at all!\nIts primary purpose is to truncate event history, which if too large may slow down your workflows and eventually cause an error. Calling it too frequently to be preemptive can cause other performance issues as each new Workflow Execution has overhead.\n\nTemporal's default limits are set to warn you at 10,000 events in a single Workflow Execution, and error at 50,000.\nThis is sufficient for:\n\n- If executing one activity a day, it can support an infinite loop for over 2 decades (27 years)\n- If executing one activity an hour, it can support an infinite loop for over 1 year (417 days)\n- If executing one activity a minute, it can support an infinite loop for over 1 week (7 days)\n\nwithout even resorting to `continueAsNew`.\n\nOur recommendation is to size it to continue as new between once a day to once a week, to ensure old version branches can be removed in a timely manner.\n\n### Example\n\nHere is a simple pattern that we recommend to represent a single entity. It keeps track of the number of iterations regardless of frequency, and calls `continueAsNew` while properly handling pending updates from Signals.\n\n```tsx\ninterface Input {\n  /* define your workflow input type here */\n}\ninterface Update {\n  /* define your workflow update type here */\n}\n\nconst MAX_ITERATIONS = 1;\n\nexport async function entityWorkflow(\n  input: Input,\n  isNew = true,\n): Promise<void> {\n  try {\n    const pendingUpdates = Array<Update>();\n    setHandler(updateSignal, (updateCommand) => {\n      pendingUpdates.push(updateCommand);\n    });\n\n    if (isNew) {\n      await setup(input);\n    }\n\n    for (let iteration = 1; iteration <= MAX_ITERATIONS; ++iteration) {\n      // Ensure that we don't block the Workflow Execution forever waiting\n      // for updates, which means that it will eventually Continue-As-New\n      // even if it does not receive updates.\n      await condition(() => pendingUpdates.length > 0, '1 day');\n\n      while (pendingUpdates.length) {\n        const update = pendingUpdates.shift();\n        await runAnActivityOrChildWorkflow(update);\n      }\n    }\n  } catch (err) {\n    if (isCancellation(err)) {\n      await CancellationScope.nonCancellable(async () => {\n        await cleanup();\n      });\n    }\n    throw err;\n  }\n  await continueAsNew<typeof entityWorkflow>(input, false);\n}\n```\n\n<span id=\"putting-it-all-together-schedule-workflow-example\" />\n\n## Workflow Utility Libraries\n\nAs you build up strong opinions of how you'd like to compose behavior, you may want to publish reusable Temporal utility function or Temporal Workflow libraries. Let us know and we'd be happy to feature them here!\n\n- [temporal-time-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/temporal-time-utils): Contains reusable versions of `sleepUntil`, `UpdatableTimer`, and `ScheduleWorkflow` described on this page.\n\nJust keep in mind the difference between utility functions (deterministic, uses Workflow APIs but have to be inlined into Workflows rather than used standalone) and Workflow functions (can be used standalone, and subject to all Workflow limitations, including that all args and results must be JSON-serializable.)\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"cluster-metrics.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/references/cluster-metrics.md","id":"references/cluster-metrics","title":"Temporal OSS Cluster metrics reference","description":"The Temporal Cluster emits a range of metrics to help operators get visibility into the Cluster’s performance and set up alerts.","label":"Cluster metrics","tags":["reference"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n:::info OSS Cluster metrics\n\nThe information on this page is relevant to open source [Temporal Cluster deployments](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster).\n\nSee [Cloud metrics](/cloud/how-to-monitor-temporal-cloud-metrics) for metrics emitted by [Temporal Cloud](/concepts/what-is-temporal-cloud).\n\nSee [SDK metrics](/references/sdk-metrics) for metrics emitted by the [SDKs](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-sdk).\n\n:::\n\nA Temporal Cluster emits a range of metrics to help operators get visibility into the Cluster’s performance and to set up alerts.\n\nAll metrics emitted by the Cluster are listed in [defs.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/metrics/defs.go).\n\nFor details on setting up metrics in your Cluster configuration, see [Temporal Cluster](/references/configuration#global).\n\nThe [dashboards repository](https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards) contains community-driven Grafana dashboard templates that can be used as a starting point for monitoring the Temporal Cluster and SDK metrics.\nYou can use these templates as references to build your own dashboards.\nFor any metrics that are missing in the dashboards, use [defs.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/metrics/defs.go) as a reference.\n\nNote that, apart from these metrics emitted by the Cluster, you should also monitor infrastructure-specific metrics like CPU, memory, and network for all hosts that are running Temporal Cluster services.\n\n## Common metrics\n\nTemporal emits metrics for each gRPC service request.\nThese metrics are emitted with `type`, `operation`, and `namespace` tags, which provide visibility into Service usage and show the request rates across Services, Namespaces, and Operations.\n\n- Use the `operation` tag in your query to get request rates, error rates, or latencies per operation.\n- Use the `service_name` tag with the [service role tag values](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/bba148cf1e1642fd39fa0174423b183d5fc62d95/common/metrics/defs.go#L108) to get details for the specific service.\n\nAll common tags that you can add in your query are defined in the [defs.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/metrics/defs.go) file.\n\nFor example, to see service requests by operation on the Frontend Service, use the following:\n\n`sum by (operation) (rate(service_requests{service_name=\"frontend\"}[2m]))`\n\nNote: All metrics queries in this topic are [Prometheus queries](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).\n\nThe following list describes some metrics you can get started with.\n\n### `service_requests`\n\nShows service requests received per Task Queue.\nExample: Service requests by operation\n`sum(rate(service_requests{operation=\\\"AddWorkflowTask\\\"}[2m]))`\n\n### `service_latency`\n\nShows latencies for all Client request operations.\nUsually these are the starting point to investigate which operation is experiencing high-latency issues.\nExample: P95 service latency by operation for the Frontend Service\n`histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(service_latency_bucket{service_name=\"frontend\"}[5m])) by (operation, le))`\n\n### `service_error_with_type`\n\n(Available only in v1.17.0+) Identifies errors encountered by the service.\nExample: Service errors by type for the Frontend Service\n`sum(rate(service_errors_with_type{service_name=\"frontend\"}[5m])) by (error_type)`\n\n### `client_errors`\n\nAn indicator for connection issues between different Server roles.\nExample: Client errors\n`sum(rate(client_errors{service_name=\"frontend\",service_role=\"history\"}[5m]))`\n\nIn addition to these, you can define some service-specific metrics to get performance details for each service.\nStart with the following list, and use [defs.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/metrics/defs.go) to define additional metrics as required.\n\n## Matching Service metrics\n\n### `poll_success`\n\nShows for Tasks that are successfully matched to a poller.\nExample: `sum(rate(poll_success{}[5m]))`\n\n### `poll_timeouts`\n\nShows when no Tasks are available for the poller within the poll timeout.\nExample: `sum(rate(poll_timeouts{}[5m]))`\n\n### `asyncmatch_latency`\n\nMeasures the time from creation to delivery for async matched Tasks.\nThe larger this latency, the longer Tasks are sitting in the queue waiting for your Workers to pick them up.\nExample: `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(asyncmatch_latency_bucket{service_name=~\"matching\"}[5m])) by (operation, le))`\n\n### `no_poller_tasks`\n\nEmitted whenever a task is added to a task queue that has no poller, and is a counter metric.\nThis is usually an indicator that either the Worker or the starter programs are using the wrong Task Queue.\nUse `no_poller_tasks_per_tl` to get data per Task Queue.\n\n## History Service metrics\n\nA History Task is an internal Task in Temporal that is created as part of a transaction to update Workflow state and is processed by the Temporal History service.\nIt is critical to ensure that the History Task processing system is healthy.\nThe following key metrics can be used to monitor the History Service health:\n\n### `task_requests`\n\nEmitted on every Task process request.\nExample: `sum(rate(task_requests{service=\"$service\",operation=~\"TransferActive.*\"}[1m]))`\n\n### `task_errors`\n\nEmitted on every Task process error.\nExample: `sum(rate(task_errors{operation=~\"TransferActive.*\"}[1m]))`\n\n### `task_attempt`\n\nNumber of attempts on each Task Execution.\nA Task is retried forever, and each retry increases the attempt count.\nExample: `histogram_quantile($percentile, sum(rate(task_attempt_bucket{service=\"$service\",operation=~\"TransferActive.*\"}[1m])) by (operation, le))`\n\n### `task_latency_processing`\n\nShows the processing latency per attempt.\nExample: `histogram_quantile($percentile, sum(rate(task_latency_processing_bucket{operation=~\"TransferActive.*\",service=\"$service\", service_name=\"history\"}[1m])) by (operation, le))`\n\n### `task_latency`\n\nMeasures the in-memory latency across multiple attempts.\n\n### `task_latency_queue`\n\nMeasures the duration, end-to-end, from when the Task should be executed (from the time it was fired) to when the Task is done.\n\n### `task_latency_load`\n\n(Available only in v1.18.0+) Measures the duration from Task generation to Task loading (Task schedule to start latency for persistence queue).\n\n### `task_latency_schedule`\n\n(Available only in v1.18.0+) Measures the duration from Task submission (to the Task scheduler) to processing (Task schedule to start latency for in-memory queue).\n\n### `queue_latency_schedule`\n\n(Available only in v1.18.0+) Measures the time to schedule 100 Tasks in one Task channel in the host-level Task scheduler.\nIf fewer than 100 Tasks are in the Task channel for 30 seconds, the latency is scaled to 100 Tasks upon emission.\nNote: This is still an experimental metric and is subject to change.\n\n### `task_latency_userlatency`\n\nShows the latency introduced because of Workflow logic.\nFor example, if you have one Workflow scheduling many Activities or Child Workflows at the same time, it can cause a per-Workflow lock contention.\nThe wait period for the per-Workflow lock is counted as `userlatency`.\n\nThe `operation` tag contains details about Task type and Active versus Standby statuses, and can be used to get request rates, error rates, or latencies per operation, which can help identify issues caused by database problems.\n\n## Persistence metrics\n\nTemporal Server emits metrics for every persistence database read and write.\nSome of the most important ones are the following:\n\n### `persistence_requests`\n\nEmitted on every persistence request.\nExamples:\n\n- Prometheus query for getting the total number of persistence requests by operation for the History Service:\n  `sum by (operation) (rate(persistence_requests{service=\"$service\",service_name=\"history\"}[1m]))`\n- Prometheus query for getting the total number of persistence requests by operation for the Matching Service:\n  `sum by (operation) (rate(persistence_requests{cluster=\"$cluster\",service_name=\"matching\"}[5m]))`\n\n### `persistence_errors`\n\nShows all persistence errors.\nThis metric is a good indicator for connection issues between Temporal Cluster and the persistence store.\nExample:\n\n- Prometheus query for getting all persistence errors by service (history)\n  `sum (rate(persistence_errors{service=\"$service\",service_name=\"history\"}[1m]))`\n\n### `persistence_error_with_type`\n\nShows all errors related to the persistence store with type, and contain an `error_type` tag.\n\n- Prometheus query for getting persistence errors with type by (history) and by error type:\n  `sum(rate(persistence_error_with_type{service=\"$service\",service_name=\"history\"}[1m])) by (error_type)`\n\n### `persistence_latency`\n\nShows the latency on persistence operations.\nExample:\n\n- Prometheus query for getting latency by percentile:\n  `histogram_quantile($percentile, sum(rate(persistence_latency_bucket{service=\"$service\" service_name=\"history\"}[1m])) by (operation, le))`\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"commands.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/references/commands.md","id":"references/commands","title":"Commands

configuration","tags":["reference"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nMuch of the behavior of a Temporal Cluster is configured using the `development.yaml` file and may contain the following top-level sections:\n\n- [`global`](#global)\n- [`persistence`](#persistence)\n- [`log`](#log)\n- [`clusterMetadata`](#clustermetadata)\n- [`services`](#services)\n- [`publicClient`](#publicclient)\n- [`archival`](#archival)\n- [`dcRedirectionPolicy`](#dcredirectionpolicy)\n- [`dynamicConfigClient`](#dynamicconfigclient)\n- [`namespaceDefaults`](#namespacedefaults)\n\nChanging any properties in the `development.yaml` file requires a process restart for changes to take effect.\nConfiguration parsing code is available [here](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/config/config.go).\n\n## global\n\nThe `global` section contains process-wide configuration. See below for a minimal configuration (optional parameters are commented out.)\n\n```yaml\nglobal:\n  membership:\n    broadcastAddress: \"127.0.0.1\"\n  metrics:\n    prometheus:\n      framework: \"opentelemetry\"\n      listenAddress: \"127.0.0.1:8000\"\n```\n\n### membership\n\nThe `membership` section controls the following membership layer parameters.\n\n#### maxJoinDuration\n\nThe amount of time the service will attempt to join the gossip layer before failing.\n\nDefault is 10s.\n\n#### broadcastAddress\n\nUsed by gossip protocol to communicate with other hosts in the same Cluster for membership info.\nUse IP address that is reachable by other hosts in the same Cluster.\nIf there is only one host in the Cluster, you can use 127.0.0.1.\nCheck `net.ParseIP` for supported syntax, only IPv4 is supported.\n\n### metrics\n\nConfigures the Cluster's metric subsystem.\nSpecific provides are configured using provider names as the keys.\n\n- [`statsd`](#statsd)\n- `prometheus`\n- `m3`\n\n#### prefix\n\nThe prefix to be applied to all outgoing metrics.\n\n#### tags\n\nThe set of key-value pairs to be reported as part of every metric.\n\n#### excludeTags\n\nA map from tag name string to tag values string list.\nThis is useful to exclude some tags that might have unbounded cardinality.\nThe value string list can be used to whitelist values of that excluded tag to continue to be included.\nFor example, if you want to exclude `task_queue` because it has unbounded cardinality, but you still want to see a whitelisted value for `task_queue`.\n\n#### statsd\n\nThe `statsd` sections supports the following settings:\n\n- `hostPort`: The host:port of the statsd server.\n- `prefix`: Specific prefix in reporting to `statsd`.\n- `flushInterval`: Maximum interval for sending packets. (_Default_ 300ms).\n- `flushBytes`: Specifies the maximum UDP packet size you wish to send. (_Default_ 1432 bytes).\n\n#### prometheus\n\nThe `prometheus` sections supports the following settings:\n\n- `framework`: The framework to use, currently supports `opentelemetry` and `tally`, default is `tally`. We plan to switch default to `opentelemetry` once its API become stable.\n- `listenAddress`: Address for Prometheus to scrape metrics from.\n  The Temporal Server uses the Prometheus client API, and the `listenAddress` configuration is used to listen for metrics.\n- `handlerPath`: Metrics handler path for scraper; default is `/metrics`.\n\n#### m3\n\nThe `m3` sections supports the following settings:\n\n- `hostPort`: The host:port of the M3 server.\n- `service`: The service tag to that this client emits.\n- `queue`: M3 reporter queue size, default is 4k.\n- `packetSize`: M3 reporter max packet size, default is 32k.\n\n### pprof\n\n- `port`: If specified, this will initialize pprof upon process start on the listed port.\n\n### tls\n\nThe `tls` section controls the SSL/TLS settings for network communication and contains two subsections, `internode` and `frontend`.\nThe `internode` section governs internal service communication among roles where the `frontend` governs SDK client communication to the Frontend Service role.\n\nEach of these subsections contain a `server` section and a `client` section.\nThe `server` contains the following parameters:\n\n- `certFile`: The path to the file containing the PEM-encoded public key of the certificate to use.\n- `keyFile`: The path to the file containing the PEM-encoded private key of the certificate to use.\n- `requireClientAuth`: _boolean_ - Requires clients to authenticate with a certificate when connecting, otherwise known as mutual TLS.\n- `clientCaFiles`: A list of paths to files containing the PEM-encoded public key of the Certificate Authorities you wish to trust for client authentication. This value is ignored if `requireClientAuth` is not enabled.\n\n:::tip\n\nSee the [server samples repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/master/tls) for sample TLS configurations.\n\n:::\n\nBelow is an example enabling Server TLS (https) between SDKs and the Frontend APIs:\n\n```yaml\nglobal:\n  tls:\n    frontend:\n      server:\n        certFile: /path/to/cert/file\n        keyFile: /path/to/key/file\n      client:\n        serverName: dnsSanInFrontendCertificate\n```\n\nNote, the `client` section generally needs to be provided to specify an expected DNS SubjectName contained in the presented server certificate via the `serverName` field; this is needed as Temporal uses IP to IP communication.\nYou can avoid specifying this if your server certificates contain the appropriate IP Subject Alternative Names.\n\nAdditionally, the `rootCaFiles` field needs to be provided when the client's host does not trust the Root CA used by the server.\nThe example below extends the above example to manually specify the Root CA used by the Frontend Services:\n\n```yaml\nglobal:\n  tls:\n    frontend:\n      server:\n        certFile: /path/to/cert/file\n        keyFile: /path/to/key/file\n      client:\n        serverName: dnsSanInFrontendCertificate\n        rootCaFiles:\n          - /path/to/frontend/server/CA/files\n```\n\nBelow is an additional example of a fully secured cluster using mutual TLS for both frontend and internode communication with manually specified CAs:\n\n```yaml\nglobal:\n  tls:\n    internode:\n      server:\n        certFile: /path/to/internode/cert/file\n        keyFile: /path/to/internode/key/file\n        requireClientAuth: true\n        clientCaFiles:\n          - /path/to/internode/serverCa\n      client:\n        serverName: dnsSanInInternodeCertificate\n        rootCaFiles:\n          - /path/to/internode/serverCa\n    frontend:\n      server:\n        certFile: /path/to/frontend/cert/file\n        keyFile: /path/to/frontend/key/file\n        requireClientAuth: true\n        clientCaFiles:\n          - /path/to/internode/serverCa\n          - /path/to/sdkClientPool1/ca\n          - /path/to/sdkClientPool2/ca\n      client:\n        serverName: dnsSanInFrontendCertificate\n        rootCaFiles:\n          - /path/to/frontend/serverCa\n```\n\n**Note:** In the case that client authentication is enabled, the `internode.server` certificate is used as the client certificate among services. This adds the following requirements:\n\n- The `internode.server` certificate must be specified on all roles, even for a frontend-only configuration.\n- Internode server certificates must be minted with either **no** Extended Key Usages or **both** ServerAuth and ClientAuth EKUs.\n- If your Certificate Authorities are untrusted, such as in the previous example, the internode server Ca will need to be specified in the following places:\n\n  - `internode.server.clientCaFiles`\n  - `internode.client.rootCaFiles`\n  - `frontend.server.clientCaFiles`\n\n## persistence\n\nThe `persistence` section holds configuration for the data store / persistence layer.\nBelow is an example minimal specification for a password-secured Cluster using Cassandra.\n\n```yaml\npersistence:\n  defaultStore: default\n  visibilityStore: visibility\n  numHistoryShards: 512\n  datastores:\n    default:\n      cassandra:\n        hosts: \"127.0.0.1\"\n        keyspace: \"temporal\"\n        user: \"username\"\n        password: \"password\"\n    visibility:\n      cassandra:\n        hosts: \"127.0.0.1\"\n        keyspace: \"temporal_visibility\"\n```\n\nThe following top level configuration items are required:\n\n### numHistoryShards\n\n_Required_ - The number of history shards to create when initializing the Cluster.\n\n**Warning**: This value is immutable and will be ignored after the first run.\nPlease ensure you set this value appropriately high enough to scale with the worst case peak load for this Cluster.\n\n### defaultStore\n\n_Required_ - The name of the data store definition that should be used by the Temporal server.\n\n### visibilityStore\n\n_Required_ - the name of the data store definition that should be used by the Temporal visibility server.\n\n### datastores\n\n_Required_ - contains named data store definitions to be referenced.\n\nEach definition is defined with a heading declaring a name (ie: `default:` and `visibility:` above), which contains a data store definition.\n\nData store definitions must be either `cassandra` or `sql`.\n\n#### cassandra\n\nA `cassandra` data store definition can contain the following values:\n\n- `hosts`: _Required_ - \",\" separated Cassandra endpoints, e.g. \"192.168.1.2,192.168.1.3,192.168.1.4\".\n- `port`: Default: 9042 - Cassandra port used for connection by `gocql` client.\n- `user`: Cassandra username used for authentication by `gocql` client.\n- `password`: Cassandra password used for authentication by `gocql` client.\n- `keyspace`: _Required_ - the Cassandra keyspace.\n- `datacenter`: The data center filter arg for Cassandra.\n- `maxConns`: The max number of connections to this data store for a single TLS configuration.\n- `tls`: See TLS below.\n\n#### sql\n\nA `sql` data store definition can contain the following values:\n\n- `user`: Username used for authentication.\n- `password`: Password used for authentication.\n- `pluginName`: _Required_ - SQL database type.\n  - _Valid values_: `mysql` or `postgres`.\n- `databaseName` - _required_ - the name of SQL database to connect to.\n- `connectAddr` - _required_ - the remote address of the database, e.g. \"192.168.1.2\".\n- `connectProtocol` - _required_ - the protocol that goes with the `connectAddr`\n  - _Valid values_: `tcp` or `unix`\n- `connectAttributes` - a map of key-value attributes to be sent as part of connect `data_source_name` url.\n- `maxConns` - the max number of connections to this data store.\n- `maxIdleConns` - the max number of idle connections to this data store\n- `maxConnLifetime` - is the maximum time a connection can be alive.\n- `tls` - See below.\n\n#### tls\n\nThe `tls` and `mtls` sections can contain the following values:\n\n- `enabled` - _boolean_.\n- `serverName` - name of the server hosting the data store.\n- `certFile` - path to the cert file.\n- `keyFile` - path to the key file.\n- `caFile` - path to the ca file.\n- `enableHostVerification` - _boolean_ - `true` to verify the hostname and server cert (like a wildcard for Cassandra cluster). This option is basically the inverse of `InSecureSkipVerify`. See `InSecureSkipVerify` in http://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/ for more info.\n\nNote: `certFile` and `keyFile` are optional depending on server config, but both fields must be omitted to avoid using a client certificate.\n\n## log\n\nThe `log` section is optional and contains the following possible values:\n\n- `stdout` - _boolean_ - `true` if the output needs to go to standard out.\n- `level` - sets the logging level.\n  - _Valid values_ - debug, info, warn, error or fatal, default to info.\n- `outputFile` - path to output log file.\n\n## clusterMetadata\n\n`clusterMetadata` contains the local cluster information. The information is used in [Multi-Cluster Replication](/concepts/what-is-multi-cluster-replication).\n\nAn example `clusterMetadata` section:\n\n```yaml\nclusterMetadata:\n  enableGlobalNamespace: false\n  failoverVersionIncrement: 10\n  masterClusterName: \"active\"\n  currentClusterName: \"active\"\n  clusterInformation:\n    active:\n      enabled: true\n      initialFailoverVersion: 0\n      rpcAddress: \"127.0.0.1:7233\"\n  #replicationConsumer:\n  #type: kafka\n```\n\n- `currentClusterName` - _required_ - the name of the current cluster. **Warning**: This value is immutable and will be ignored after the first run.\n- `enableGlobalNamespace` - _Default:_ `false`.\n- `replicationConsumer` - determines which method to use to consume replication tasks. The type may be either `kafka` or `rpc`.\n- `failoverVersionIncrement` - the increment of each cluster version when failover happens.\n- `masterClusterName` - the master cluster name, only the master cluster can register/update namespace. All clusters can do namespace failover.\n- `clusterInformation` - contains the local cluster name to `ClusterInformation` definition. The local cluster name should be consistent with `currentClusterName`. `ClusterInformation` sections consist of:\n  - `enabled` - _boolean_ - whether a remote cluster is enabled for replication.\n  - `initialFailoverVersion`\n  - `rpcAddress` - indicate the remote service address (host:port). Host can be DNS name. Use `dns:///` prefix to enable round-robin between IP address for DNS name.\n\n## services\n\nThe `services` section contains configuration keyed by service role type.\nThere are four supported service roles:\n\n- `frontend`\n- `matching`\n- `worker`\n- `history`\n\nBelow is a minimal example of a `frontend` service definition under `services`:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  frontend:\n    rpc:\n      grpcPort: 8233\n      membershipPort: 8933\n      bindOnIP: \"0.0.0.0\"\n```\n\nThere are two sections defined under each service heading:\n\n### rpc\n\n_Required_\n\n`rpc` contains settings related to the way a service interacts with other services. The following values are supported:\n\n- `grpcPort` is the port on which gRPC will listen.\n- `membershipPort`: Port used to communicate with other hosts in the same Cluster for membership info.\n  Each service should use different port.\n  If there are multiple Temporal Clusters in your environment (Kubernetes for example), and they have network access to each other, each cCluster should use different membershipPort.\n- `bindOnLocalHost`: Determines whether uses `127.0.0.1` as the listener address.\n- `bindOnIP`: Used to bind service on specific IP, or `0.0.0.0`.\n  Check `net.ParseIP` for supported syntax, only IPv4 is supported, mutually exclusive with `BindOnLocalHost` option.\n\n**Note**: Port values are currently expected to be consistent among role types across all hosts.\n\n## publicClient\n\nThe `publicClient` a required section describing the configuration needed to for worker to connect to Temporal server for background server maintenance.\n\n- `hostPort` IPv4 host port or DNS name to reach Temporal frontend, [reference](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md)\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\npublicClient:\n  hostPort: \"localhost:8933\"\n```\n\nUse `dns:///` prefix to enable round-robin between IP address for DNS name.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"events.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/references/events.md","id":"references/events","title":"Events

the server package `go.temporal.io/server/temporal` and using it to create and start a Temporal Server.\n\nThe Temporal Server services can be [run in various ways](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster).\nWe recommend this approach for a limited number of situations.\n\n```go\ns := temporal.NewServer()\nerr := s.Start()\nif err != nil{\n\tlog.Fatal(err)\n}\n```\n\n`NewServer()` accepts functions as parameters.\nEach function returns a `ServerOption` that is applied to the instance.\nSource code for parameter reference is here: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/temporal/server_option.go\n\n### WithConfig\n\nOverrides the default configuration with a custom configuration that is defined in the config package `go.temporal.io/server/common/service/config`.\n\n```go\ns := temporal.NewServer(\n\ttemporal.WithConfig(cfg),\n)\n```\n\n### WithConfigLoader\n\nLoad a custom configuration from a file.\n\n```go\ns := temporal.NewServer(\n\ttemporal.WithConfigLoader(configDir, env, zone),\n)\n```\n\n### ForServices\n\nSets the list of all valid temporal services.\nThe default can be used from the `go.temporal.io/server/temporal` package.\n\n```go\ns := temporal.NewServer(\n\ttemporal.ForServices(temporal.Services),\n)\n```\n\n### InterruptOn\n\nThis option provides a channel that interrupts the server on the signal from that channel.\n\n- If `temporal.InterruptOn()` is not passed, `server.Start()` is never blocked and you need to call `server.Stop()` somewhere.\n- If `temporal.InterruptOn(nil)` is passed, `server.Start()` blocks forever until the process is killed.\n- If `temporal.InterruptOn(temporal.InterruptCh())` is passed, `server.Start()` blocks until you use Ctrl+C, which then gracefully shuts the server down.\n- If `temporal.Interrupt(someCustomChan)` is passed, `server.Start()` blocks until a signal is sent to `someCustomChan`.\n\n```go\ns := temporal.NewServer(\n\ttemporal.InterruptOn(temporal.InterruptCh()),\n)\n```\n\n### WithAuthorizer\n\nSets a low level [authorization mechanism](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin) that determines whether to allow or deny inbound API calls.\n\n```go\ns := temporal.NewServer(\n\ttemporal.WithAuthorizer(myAuthorizer),\n)\n```\n\n### WithTLSConfigFactory\n\nOverrides the default TLS configuration provider.\n`TLSConfigProvider` is defined in the `go.temporal.io/server/common/rpc/encryption` package.\n\n```go\ns := temporal.NewServer(\n\ttemporal.WithTLSConfigFactory(yourTLSConfigProvider),\n)\n```\n\n### WithClaimMapper\n\nConfigures a [mechanism to map roles](/security/#claimmapper-plugin-interface) to `Claims` for authorization.\n\n```go\ns := temporal.NewServer(\n  temporal.WithClaimMapper(func(cfg *config.Config) authorization.ClaimMapper {\n\t\treturn authorization.NewDefaultJWTClaimMapper(\n\t\t\tauthorization.NewRSAKeyProvider(cfg),\n\t\t\tcfg\n\t\t)\n\t}),\n)\n```\n\n### WithCustomMetricsReporter\n\nSets a custom tally metric

temporalio/ui:<tag>\n``` -->\n\nThe environment variables are defined in the [UI server configuration template file](https://github.com/temporalio/ui-server/blob/main/docker/config_template.yaml) and described in more detail below.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`\n\nThe [Frontend Service](/concepts/what-is-a-frontend-service) address for the Temporal Cluster.\nThis environmental variable can be set [in the base configuration file](/references/web-ui-configuration#temporalgrpcaddress) using `temporalGrpcAddress`.\n\nThis variable is required for setting other environmental variables.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_UI_PORT`\n\nThe port used by the Temporal WebUI Server and the HTTP API.\n\nThis variable is needed for `TEMPORAL_OPENAPI_ENABLED` and all auth-related settings to work properly.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_PUBLIC_PATH`\n\nStores a value such as \"\" or \"/custom-path\" that allows the UI to be served from a subpath.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_AUTH_ENABLED`\n\nEnables or disables Web UI authentication and authorization methods.\n\nWhen enabled, the Web UI will use the provider information in the [UI configuration file](/references/web-ui-configuration#auth) to verify the identity of users.\n\nAll auth-related variables can be defined when `TEMPORAL_AUTH_ENABLED` is set to \"true\".\nDisabling the variable will retain given values.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_AUTH_PROVIDER_URL`\n\nThe .well-known IDP discovery URL for authentication and authorization.\n\nThis can be set as in the UI server configuration with [auth](/references/web-ui-configuration#auth).\n\n## `TEMPORAL_AUTH_ISSUER_URL`\n\nThe URL for the authentication or authorization issuer.\n\nThis value is only needed when the issuer differes from the auth provider URL.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`\n\nThe client ID used for authentication or authorization.\n\nThis value is a required parameter.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`\n\nThe client secret used for authentication and authorization.\n\nClient Secrets are used by the oAuth Client for authentication.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_AUTH_CALLBACK_URL`\n\nThe callback URL used by Temporal for authentication and authorization.\n\nCallback URLs are invoked by IDP after user has finished authenticating in IDP.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_UI_ENABLED`\n\nEnables or disables the [browser UI](/references/web-ui-configuration#enableui) for the Temporal Cluster.\n\nEnabling the browser UI allows the Server to be accessed from your web browser.\nIf disabled, the server cannot be viewed on the web, but the UI server APIs remain available for use.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_OPENAPI_ENABLED`\n\nEnables or disables OpenAPI features for the Temporal Web UI.\n\nThis can be set initially with the [enableOpenAPI](/references/web-ui-configuration#enableopenapi) UI configuration.\nThe documentation can be found at `/openapi/` on your Temporal Cluster.\n\nThis variable requires `TEMPORAL_UI_ENABLED` to be set to 'true'.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_DEFAULT_NAMESPACE`\n\nThe default [Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace) that the Web UI opens first.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_FEEDBACK_URL`\n\nThe URL that users are directed to when they click the Feedback button in the UI.\n\nIf not specified, this variable defaults to the UI's GitHub Issue page.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_NOTIFY_ON_NEW_VERSION`\n\nEnables or disables notifications that appear in the UI whenever a newer version of the Temporal Cluster is available.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_REFRESH_INTERVAL`\n\nDetermines how often the UI Server reads the configuration file for new values.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_TLS_CA`\n\nThe path for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Certificate Authority file.\n\nIn order to [configure TLS for your server](/references/web-ui-configuration#tls), you'll need a CA certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority.\nSet this variable to properly locate and use the file.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_TLS_CERT`\n\nThe path for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Certificate.\n\nIn order to [configure TLS for your server](/references/web-ui-configuration#tls), you'll need a self-signed certificate.\nSet the path to allow the environment to locate and use the certificate.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_TLS_KEY`\n\nThe path for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) [key file](/references/web-ui-configuration#tls).\n\nA key file is used to create private and public keys for encryption and signing.\nTogether, these keys are used to create certificates.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_TLS_CA_DATA`\n\nStores the data for a TLS CA file.\n\nThis variable can be used instead of providing a path for `TEMPORAL_TLS_CA`.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_TLS_CERT_DATA`\n\nStores the data for a TLS cert file.\n\nThis variable can be used instead of providing a path for `TEMPORAL_TLS_CERT`.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_TLS_KEY_DATA`\n\nStores the data for a TLS key file.\n\nThis variable can be used instead of providing a path for `TEMPORAL_TLS_KEY`.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_TLS_ENABLE_HOST_VERIFICATION`\n\nEnables or disables [Transport Layer Security (TLS) host verification](/references/web-ui-configuration#tls).\n\nWhen enabled, TLS checks the Host Server to ensure that files are being sent to and from the correct URL.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_TLS_SERVER_NAME`\n\nThe server on which to operate [Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols](/references/web-ui-configuration#tls).\n\nTLS allows the current server to transmit encrypted files to other URLs without having to reveal itself.\nBecause of this, TLS operates a go-between server.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_CODEC_ENDPOINT`\n\nThe endpoint for the [Codec Server](/concepts/what-is-a-codec-server), if configured.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_CODEC_PASS_ACCESS_TOKEN`\n\nWhether to send a JWT access token as ‘authorization’ header in requests with the Codec Server.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_FORWARD_HEADERS`\n\nForward-specified HTTP headers to direct from HTTP API requests to the Temporal gRPC backend.\n\n## `TEMPORAL_DISABLE_WRITE_ACTIONS`\n\nDisables any button in the UI that allows the user to modify Workflows or Activities.\n","is_empty":false},{"file_name":"strongly-typed-errors/bad-cancel-timer-attributes.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/references/strongly-typed-errors/bad-cancel-timer-attributes.md","id":"references/strongly-typed-errors/bad-cancel-timer-attributes","title":"Bad

locally together with Temporal Server in [Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose): `docker exec temporal-admin-tools tctl YOUR COMMANDS HERE`\n  - To invoke [tctl](/tctl-v1) as though it is installed locally (such as `tctl namespace describe`), set an alias: `alias tctl=\"docker exec temporal-admin-tools tctl\"`\n- Run the [temporal-admin-tools](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/admin-tools) Docker image:\n  - On Linux: `docker run --rm -it --entrypoint tctl --network host --env TEMPORAL_CLI_ADDRESS=localhost:7233

Temporal Server is running on a remote host, change the value of `TEMPORAL_CLI_ADDRESS`.\n  - To simplify command lines, create a `tctl` alias.\n- Build it locally:\n  1. Clone the [Temporal Server repo](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal).\n  1. Run `make tctl`.\n  1. Copy the `tctl` executable to any directory that appears in the `PATH` environment variable; for example, `/usr/bin/`.\n- Install the latest version of the tctl in your `GOPATH`: `go install
