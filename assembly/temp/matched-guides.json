up as a part of your [Persistence store](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster#persistence) to enable listing and filtering details about Workflow Executions that exist on your Temporal Cluster.\n\nA Visibility store is required in a Temporal Cluster setup because it is used by Temporal Web UI and CLI to pull Workflow Execution data and enables features like batch operations on a group of Workflow Executions.\n\nWith the Visibility store, you can use [List Filters](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter) with [Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute) to list and filter Workflow Executions that you want to review.\n\nSetting up [advanced Visibility](/concepts/what-is-advanced-visibility) enables access to creating and using multiple custom Search Attributes with your List Filters.\n\nFor details, see [Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute).\n\nNote that if you use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite as your Visibility store, Temporal Server version 1.20 and later supports advanced Visibility features on MySQL (version 8.0.17 and later), PostgreSQL (version 12 and later) and SQLite (v3.31.0 and later), in addition to Elasticsearch.\n\nTo enable advanced Visibility on your SQL databases, ensure that you do the following:\n\n- [Upgrade your Temporal Server](/clusters/how-to-upgrade-the-temporal-server-version) to version 1.20 or later.\n- [Update your database schemas](/clusters/how-to-upgrade-the-temporal-server-version#upgrade-mysql-or-postgresql-schema) for MySQL to version 8.0.17 (or later), PostgreSQL to version 12 (or later), or SQLite to v3.31.0 (or later).\n\nBeginning with Temporal Server v1.21, you can set up a secondary Visibility store in your Temporal Cluster to enable [Dual Visibility](/concepts/what-is-dual-visibility).\nThis is useful for migrating your Visibility store database.\n\n#### Supported databases\n\nThe following databases are supported as Visibility stores:\n\n- [MySQL](/clusters/how-to-set-up-mysql-visibility-store) v5.7 and later.\n  Use v8.0.17 (or later) with Temporal Server v1.20 or later for advanced Visibility capabilities.\n  Because standard Visibility is deprecated beginning with Temporal Server v1.21, support for older versions of MySQL will be dropped.\n- [PostgreSQL](/clusters/how-to-set-up-postgresql-visibility-store) v9.6 and later.\n  Use v12 (or later) with Temporal Server v1.20 or later for advanced Visibility capabilities.\n  Because standard Visibility is deprecated beginning with Temporal Server v1.21, support for older versions of PostgreSQL will be dropped.\n- [SQLite](/clusters/how-to-set-up-sqlite-visibility-store) v3.31.0 and later for advanced Visibility capabilities.\n- [Cassandra](/clusters/how-to-set-up-cassandra-visibility-store).\n  Support for Cassandra as a Visibility database is deprecated beginning with Temporal Server v1.21.\n- [Elasticsearch](/clusters/how-to-integrate-elasticsearch-into-a-temporal-cluster) supported versions.\n  We recommend operating a Temporal Cluster with Elasticsearch as your Visibility store for any use case that spawns more than a few Workflow Executions.\n\nYou can use any combination of the supported databases for your Persistence and Visibility stores.\nFor updates, check [Server release

later, any [custom Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute#custom-search-attributes) that you create must be associated with a Namespace in that Cluster.\n\n**Persistence configuration**\n\nSet your MySQL Visibility store name in the `visibilityStore` parameter in your Persistence configuration, and then define the Visibility store configuration under `datastores`.\n\nThe following example shows how to set a Visibility store `mysql-visibility` and define the datastore configuration in your Temporal Cluster configuration

In your Cluster configuration, [add a secondary Visibility store](/references/configuration#secondaryvisibilitystore) to your Visibility setup under the Persistence configuration.\n\n   Example: To migrate from Cassandra to Elasticsearch, add Elasticsearch as your secondary database and set it up.\n   For details, see [secondary Visibility database schema and setup](/cluster-deployment-guide#set-up-secondary-visibility-store).\n\n   ```yaml\n   persistence:\n   visibilityStore: cass-visibility\n   secondaryVisibilityStore: es-visibility\n   datastores:\n       cass-visibility:\n       cassandra:\n           hosts: \"127.0.0.1\"\n           keyspace: \"temporal_visibility\"\n       es-visibility:\n       elasticsearch:\n           version: \"v7\"\n           logLevel: \"error\"\n           url:\n           scheme: \"http\"\n           host: \"127.0.0.1:9200\"\n           indices:\n           visibility: temporal_visibility_v1_dev\n           closeIdleConnectionsInterval: 15s\n   ```\n\n1. Update the [dynamic configuration](/clusters#dynamic-configuration) keys on your self-hosted Temporal Cluster to enable write operations to the secondary store and disable read operations.\n   Example:\n\n   ```yaml\n   system.secondaryVisibilityWritingMode:\n   - value: \"dual\"\n   constraints: {}\n   system.enableReadFromSecondaryVisibility:\n   - value: false\n   constraints: {}\n   ```\n\nAt this point, Visibility data is read from the primary store, and all Visibility data is written to both the primary and secondary store.\nThis setting applies only to new Visibility data generated after Dual Visibility is enabled.\nIt does not migrate any existing data in the primary store to the secondary store.\n\nFor details on write options to the secondary store, see [Secondary Visibility dynamic configuration reference](/references/dynamic-configuration#secondary-visibility-settings).\n\n#### Run in dual mode\n\nWhen you enable a secondary store, only new Visibility data is written to both primary and secondary stores.\nThe primary store still holds the Workflow Execution data from before the secondary store was set up.\n\nRunning in dual mode lets you plan for closed and open Workflow Executions data from before the secondary store was set up in your self-hosted Temporal Cluster.\n\nExample:\n\n- To manage closed Workflow Executions data, run in dual mode until the Namespace [Retention Period](/clusters#retention-period) is reached.\n  After the Retention Period, Workflow Execution data is removed from the Persistence and Visibility stores.\n  If you want to keep the closed Workflow Executions data after the set Retention Period, you must set up [Archival](/cluster-deployment-guide#archival).\n- To manage data for all open Workflow Executions, run in dual mode until all the Workflow Executions started before enabling Dual Visibility mode are closed.\n  After the Workflow Executions are closed, verify the Retention Period and set up Archival if you need to keep the data beyond the Retention Period.\n\nYou can run your Visibility setup in dual mode for an indefinite period, or until you are ready to deprecate the primary store and move completely to the secondary store without losing data.\n\n#### Deprecate primary Visibility store\n\nWhen you are ready to deprecate your primary store, follow these steps.\n\n1. Update the dynamic configuration YAML to enable read operations from the secondary store.\n   Example:\n\n   ```yaml\n   system.secondaryVisibilityWritingMode:\n   - value: \"dual\"\n   constraints: {}\n   system.enableReadFromSecondaryVisibility:\n   - value: true\n   constraints: {}\n   ```\n\n   At this point, Visibility data is read from the secondary store only.\n   Verify whether data on the secondary store is correct.\n\n1. When the secondary store is vetted and ready to replace your current primary store, change your Cluster configuration to set the secondary store as your primary, and remove the dynamic configuration set in the previous steps.\n   Example:\n\n   ```yaml\n   persistence:\n   visibilityStore: es-visibility\n   datastores:\n       es-visibility:\n       elasticsearch:\n           version: \"v7\"\n           logLevel: \"error\"\n           url:\n           scheme: \"http\"\n           host: \"127.0.0.1:9200\"\n           indices:\n           visibility: temporal_visibility_v1_dev\n           closeIdleConnectionsInterval: 15s\n   ```\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"cluster-ops-context/manage-custom-search-attributes","node":{"file_name":"manage-custom-search-attributes.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/cluster-ops-context/manage-custom-search-attributes.md","id":"cluster-ops-context/manage-custom-search-attributes","title":"Managing custom Search Attributes","description":"You can create custom Search Attributes.

Temporal Cluster and `tcld` for Temporal Cloud.\n\nCreating a custom Search Attribute in your Visibility store makes it available to use in your Workflow metadata and [List Filters](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter).\n\n**On Temporal Cloud**\n\nTo create custom Search Attributes on Temporal Cloud, use [`tcld namespace search-attributes add`](/cloud/tcld/namespace#search-attributes).\nFor example, to add a custom Search Attributes \"CustomSA\" to your Temporal Cloud Namespace \"YourNamespace\", run the following command.\n`tcld namespace search-attributes add --namespace YourNamespace --search-attribute \"CustomSA\"`\n\n**On self-hosted Temporal Cluster**\n\nIf you're self-hosting your Temporal Cluster, verify whether your [Visibility database](/clusters/how-to-set-up-visibility-in-a-temporal-cluster#supported-databases) version supports advanced Visibility features.\n\nTo create custom Search Attributes in your self-hosted Temporal Cluster Visibility store, use `tctl search-attribute create` with `--name` and `--type` modifiers.\n\nFor example, to create a Search Attribute called `CustomSA` of type `Keyword`, run the following command:\n\n`tctl search-attribute create --name CustomSA --type Keyword`\n\nNote that if you use a SQL database with advanced Visibility capabilities, you are required to specify a Namespace when creating a custom Search Attribute.\nFor example: `tctl --ns yournamespace search-attribute create --name CustomSA --type Keyword`\n\nYou can also create multiple custom Search Attributes when you set up your Visibility store.\n\nFor example, the [auto-setup.sh](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-builds/blob/main/docker/auto-setup.sh) script that is used to set up your local [docker-compose Temporal Cluster](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) creates custom Search Attributes in the Visibility store, as shown in the following code snippet from the script (for SQL databases).\n\n```bash\nadd_custom_search_attributes() {\n    until temporal operator search-attribute list --namespace \"${DEFAULT_NAMESPACE}\"; do\n      echo \"Waiting for namespace cache to refresh...\"\n      sleep 1\n    done\n    echo \"Namespace cache refreshed.\"\n\n    echo \"Adding Custom*Field search attributes.\"\n\n    temporal operator search-attribute create --namespace \"${DEFAULT_NAMESPACE}\" --yes \\\n        --name CustomKeywordField --type Keyword \\\n        --name CustomStringField --type Text \\\n        --name CustomTextField --type Text \\\n        --name CustomIntField --type Int \\\n        --name CustomDatetimeField --type Datetime \\\n        --name CustomDoubleField --type Double \\\n        --name CustomBoolField --type Bool\n}\n```\n\nNote that this script has been updated for Temporal Server v1.20, which requires associating every custom Search Attribute with a Namespace when using a SQL database.\n\nFor Temporal Server v1.19 and earlier, or if using Elasticsearch for advanced Visibility, you can create custom Search Attributes without a Namespace association, as shown in the following example.\n\n```bash\nadd_custom_search_attributes() {\n       echo \"Adding Custom*Field search attributes.\"\n       tctl --auto_confirm admin cluster add-search-attributes \\\n           --name

Archival","tags":["how-to"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n[Archival](/concepts/what-is-archival) consists of the following elements:\n\n- **Configuration**: Archival is controlled by the [server configuration](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/config/development.yaml#L81) (i.e. the `config/development.yaml` file).\n- **Provider**: Location where the data should be archived. Supported providers are S3, GCloud, and the local file system.\n- **URI**: Specifies which provider should be used. The system uses the URI schema and path to make the determination.\n\nTake the following steps to set up Archival:\n\n1. [Set up the provider](#providers) of your choice.\n2. [Configure Archival](#configuration).\n3. [Create a Namespace](#namespace-creation) that uses a valid URI and has Archival enabled.\n\n#### Providers\n\nTemporal directly supports several providers:\n\n- **Local file system**: The [filestore archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/filestore) is used to archive data in the file system of whatever host the Temporal server is running on. This provider is used mainly for local installations and testing and should not be relied on for production environments.\n- **Google Cloud**: The [gcloud archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/gcloud) is used to connect and archive data with [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/storage).\n- **S3**: The [s3store archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/s3store) is used to connect and archive data with [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3).\n- **Custom**: If you want to use a provider that is not currently supported, you can [create your own archiver](/clusters/how-to-create-a-custom-archiver) to support it.\n\nMake sure that you save the provider's storage location URI in a place where you can reference it later, because it is passed as a parameter when you [create a Namespace](#namespace-creation).\n\n#### Configuration\n\nArchival configuration is defined in the [`config/development.yaml`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/config/development.yaml#L93) file.\nLet's look at an example configuration:\n\n```yaml\n# Cluster level Archival config\narchival:\n  # Event History configuration\n  history:\n    # Archival is enabled at the cluster level\n    state: \"enabled\"\n    enableRead: true\n    # Namespaces can use either the local filestore provider or the Google Cloud provider\n    provider:\n      filestore:\n        fileMode: \"0666\"\n        dirMode: \"0766\"\n      gstorage:\n        credentialsPath: \"/tmp/gcloud/keyfile.json\"\n\n# Default values for a Namespace if none are provided at creation\nnamespaceDefaults:\n  # Archival defaults\n  archival:\n    # Event History defaults\n    history:\n      state: \"enabled\"\n      # New Namespaces will default to the local provider\n      URI: \"file:///tmp/temporal_archival/development\"\n```\n\nYou can disable Archival by setting `archival.history.state` and `namespaceDefaults.archival.history.state` to `\"disabled\"`.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\narchival:\n  history:\n    state: \"disabled\"\n\nnamespaceDefaults:\n  archival:\n    history:\n      state: \"disabled\"\n```\n\nThe following table showcases acceptable values for each configuration and what purpose they serve.\n\n| Config                                         | Acceptable values                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                  |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `archival.history.state`                       | `enabled`, `disabled`                                                              | Must be `enabled` to use the Archival feature with any Namespace in the cluster.                                             |\n| `archival.history.enableRead`                  | `true`, `false`                                                                    | Must be `true` to read from the archived Event History.                                                                      |\n| `archival.history.provider`                    | Sub provider configs are `filestore`, `gstorage`, `s3`, or `your_custom_provider`. | Default config specifies `filestore`.                                                                                        |\n| `archival.history.provider.filestore.fileMode` | File permission string                                                             | File permissions of the archived files. We recommend using the default value of `\"0666\"` to avoid read/write issues.         |\n| `archival.history.provider.filestore.dirMode`  | File permission string                                                             | Directory permissions of the archive directory. We recommend using the default value of `\"0766\"` to avoid read/write issues. |\n| `namespaceDefaults.archival.history.state`     | `enabled`, `disabled`                                                              | Default state of the Archival feature whenever a new Namespace is created without specifying the Archival state.             |\n| `namespaceDefaults.archival.history.URI`       | Valid URI                                                                          | Must be a URI of the file store location and match a schema that correlates to a provider.                                   |\n\nAdditional resources: [Cluster configuration reference](/references/configuration).\n\n#### Namespace creation\n\nAlthough Archival is configured at the cluster level, it operates independently within each Namespace.\nIf an Archival URI is not specified when a Namespace is created, the Namespace uses the value of `defaultNamespace.archival.history.URI` from the `config/development.yaml` file.\nThe Archival URI cannot be changed after the Namespace is created.\nEach Namespace supports only a single Archival URI, but each Namespace can use a different URI.\nA Namespace can safely switch Archival between `enabled` and `disabled` states as long as Archival is enabled at the cluster level.\n\nArchival is supported in [Global Namespaces](/concepts/what-is-a-global-namespace) (Namespaces that span multiple clusters).\nWhen Archival is running in a Global Namespace, it first runs on the active cluster; later it runs on the standby cluster. Before archiving, a history check is done to see what has been previously archived.\n\n#### Test setup\n\nTo test Archival locally, start by running a Temporal server:\n\n```bash\n./temporal-server start\n```\n\nThen register a new Namespace with Archival enabled.\n\n```bash\n./tctl --ns samples-namespace namespace register --gd false --history_archival_state enabled --retention 3\n```\n\n:::note\n\nIf the retention period isn't set, it defaults to two days.\nThe minimum retention period is one day.\nThe maximum retention period is 30 days.\n\nSetting the retention period to 0 results in the error _A valid retention period is not set on request_.\n\n:::\n\nNext, run a sample Workflow such as the [helloworld temporal sample](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-go-samples/tree/master/helloworld).\n\nWhen execution is finished, Archival occurs.\n\n#### Retrieve archives\n\nYou can retrieve archived Event Histories by copying the `workflowId` and `runId` of the completed Workflow from the log output and running the following command:\n\n```bash\n./tctl --ns samples-namespace wf show --wid <workflowId> --rid <runId>\n```\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"clusters/how-to-create-a-custom-archiver","node":{"file_name":"how-to-create-a-custom-archiver.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/clusters/how-to-create-a-custom-archiver.md","id":"clusters/how-to-create-a-custom-archiver","title":"How to create a custom Archiver","description":"To archive data with a given provider, using the Archival feature, Temporal must have a corresponding Archiver component installed.","label":"Custom Archiver","tags":["how-to"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTo archive data with a given provider, using the [Archival](/concepts/what-is-archival) feature, Temporal must have a corresponding Archiver component installed.\nThe platform does not limit you to the existing providers.\nTo use a provider that is not currently supported, you can create your own Archiver.\n\n#### Create a new package\n\nThe first step is to create a new package for your implementation in [/common/archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver).\nCreate a directory in the archiver folder and arrange the structure to look like the following:\n\n```\ntemporal/common/archiver\n  - filestore/                      -- Filestore implementation\n  - provider/\n      - provider.go                 -- Provider of archiver instances\n  - yourImplementation/\n      - historyArchiver.go          -- HistoryArchiver implementation\n      - historyArchiver_test.go     -- Unit tests for HistoryArchiver\n      - visibilityArchiver.go       -- VisibilityArchiver implementations\n      - visibilityArchiver_test.go  -- Unit tests for VisibilityArchiver\n```\n\n#### Archiver interfaces\n\nNext, define objects that implement the [HistoryArchiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/interface.go#L80) and the [VisibilityArchiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/interface.go#L121) interfaces.\n\nThe objects should live in `historyArchiver.go` and `visibilityArchiver.go`, respectively.\n\n#### Update provider\n\nUpdate the `GetHistoryArchiver` and `GetVisibilityArchiver` methods of the `archiverProvider` object in the [/common/archiver/provider/provider.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/provider/provider.go) file so that it knows how to create an instance of your archiver.\n\n#### Add configs\n\nAdd configs for your archiver to the `config/development.yaml` file and then modify the [HistoryArchiverProvider](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/config/config.go#L376) and [VisibilityArchiverProvider](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/config/config.go#L393) structs in `/common/common/config.go` accordingly.\n\n#### Custom archiver FAQ\n\n**If my custom Archive method can automatically be retried by the caller, how can I record and access progress between retries?**\n\nHandle this situation by using `ArchiverOptions`.\nHere is an example:\n\n```go\nfunc(a * Archiver) Archive(ctx context.Context, URI string, request * ArchiveRequest, opts...ArchiveOption) error {\n    featureCatalog: = GetFeatureCatalog(opts...) // this function is defined in options.go\n    var progress progress\n    // Check if the feature for recording progress is enabled.\n    if featureCatalog.ProgressManager != nil {\n        if err: = featureCatalog.ProgressManager.LoadProgress(ctx, & prevProgress);\n        err != nil {\n            // log some error message and return error if needed.\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Your archiver implementation...\n\n    // Record current progress\n    if featureCatalog.ProgressManager != nil {\n        if err: = featureCatalog.ProgressManager.RecordProgress(ctx, progress);\n        err != nil {\n            // log some error message and return error if needed.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**If my `Archive` method encounters an error that is non-retryable, how do I indicate to the caller that it should not retry?**\n\n```go\nfunc(a * Archiver) Archive(ctx context.Context, URI string, request * ArchiveRequest, opts...ArchiveOption) error {\n    featureCatalog: = GetFeatureCatalog(opts...) // this function is defined in options.go\n\n    err: = youArchiverImpl()\n\n    if nonRetryableErr(err) {\n        if featureCatalog.NonRetryableError != nil {\n            return featureCatalog.NonRetryableError() // when the caller gets this error type back it will not retry anymore.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**How does my history archiver implementation read history?**\n\nThe archiver package provides a utility called [HistoryIterator](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/historyIterator.go) which is a wrapper of [ExecutionManager](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/persistence/dataInterfaces.go#L1014).\n`HistoryIterator` is more simple than the `HistoryManager`, which is available in the BootstrapContainer, so archiver implementations can choose to use it when reading Workflow histories.\nSee the [historyIterator.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/historyIterator.go) file for more details.\nUse the [filestore historyArchiver implementation](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/filestore) as an example.\n\n**Should my archiver define its own error types?**\n\nEach archiver is free to define and return its own errors.\nHowever, many common errors that exist between archivers are already defined in [common/archiver/constants.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/constants.go).\n\n**Is there a generic query syntax for the visibility archiver?**\n\nCurrently, no.\nBut this is something we plan to do in the future.\nAs for now, try to make your syntax similar to the one used by our advanced list Workflow API.\n\n- [s3store](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/s3store#visibility-query-syntax)\n-

to upgrade the Temporal Server version","description":"If a newer version of the Temporal Server is available, a notification appears in the Temporal Web UI.","label":"Upgrade Server","tags":["how-to"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nIf a newer version of the [Temporal Server](/concepts/what-is-the-temporal-server) is available, a notification appears in the Temporal Web UI.\n\n:::info\n\nIf you are using a version that is older than 1.0.0, reach out to us at [community.temporal.io](http://community.temporal.io) to ask how to upgrade.\n\n:::\n\nFirst check to see if an upgrade to the database schema is required for the version you wish to upgrade to.\nIf a database schema upgrade is required, it will be called out directly in the [release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases).\nSome releases require changes to the schema, and some do not.\nWe ensure that any consecutive versions are compatible in terms of database schema upgrades, features, and system behavior; however there is no guarantee that there is compatibility between _any_ two non-consecutive versions.\n\nWhen upgrading your Temporal Server version, ensure that you upgrade sequentially.\nFor example, when upgrading from v1.n.x, always upgrade to v1.n+1.x (or the next available version) and so on until you get to the required version.\n\nThe Temporal Server upgrade updates or rewrites the old version data with the format introduced in the newer version.\nBecause Temporal Server guarantees backward compatibility between two consecutive minor versions, and because older versions of the code are eventually removed from the code base, skipping versions when upgrading might cause older formats to become unrecognizable.\nIf the old format of the data can't be read to be rewritten to the new format, the upgrades fail.\n\nCheck the [Temporal Server releases](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases) and follow these releases in order.\nYou can skip patch versions; use the latest patch of a minor version when upgrading.\n\nAlso be aware that each upgrade requires the History Service to load all Shards and update the Shard metadata, so allow approximately 10 minutes on each version for these processes to complete before upgrading to the next version.\n\nUse one of the upgrade tools to upgrade your database schema to be compatible with the Temporal Server version being upgraded to.\n\nIf you are using a schema tools version prior to Temporal Server v1.8.0, we strongly recommend _never_ using the \"dryrun\" (`-y`, or `--dryrun`) options in any of your schema update commands.\nUsing this option might lead to potential loss of data, as when using it will create a new database and drop your\nexisting one.\nThis flag was removed in the 1.8.0 release.\n\n### Upgrade Cassandra schema\n\nIf you are using Cassandra for your Cluster's persistence, use the `temporal-cassandra-tool` to upgrade both the default Persistence and Visibility schemas.\n\n**Example default schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\ntemporal_v1.2.1 $ temporal-cassandra-tool \\\n   --tls \\\n   --tls-ca-file <...> \\\n   --user <cassandra-user> \\\n   --password <cassandra-password> \\\n   --endpoint <cassandra.example.com> \\\n   --keyspace temporal \\\n   --timeout 120 \\\n   update \\\n   --schema-dir ./schema/cassandra/temporal/versioned\n```\n\n**Example visibility schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\ntemporal_v1.2.1 $ temporal-cassandra-tool \\\n   --tls \\\n   --tls-ca-file <...> \\\n   --user <cassandra-user> \\\n   --password <cassandra-password> \\\n   --endpoint <cassandra.example.com> \\\n   --keyspace temporal_visibility \\\n   --timeout 120 \\\n   update \\\n   --schema-dir ./schema/cassandra/visibility/versioned\n```\n\n### Upgrade PostgreSQL or MySQL schema\n\nIf you are using MySQL or PostgreSQL use the `temporal-sql-tool`, which works similarly to the `temporal-cassandra-tool`.\n\nRefer to this [Makefile](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.4.1/Makefile#L367-L383) for context.\n\n#### PostgreSQL\n\n**Example default schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\n./temporal-sql-tool \\\n\t--tls \\\n\t--tls-enable-host-verification \\\n\t--tls-cert-file <path to your client cert> \\\n\t--tls-key-file <path to your client key> \\\n\t--tls-ca-file <path to your CA> \\\n\t--ep localhost -p 5432 -u temporal -pw temporal --pl postgres --db temporal update-schema -d ./schema/postgresql/v96/temporal/versioned\n```\n\n**Example visibility schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\n./temporal-sql-tool \\\n\t--tls \\\n\t--tls-enable-host-verification \\\n\t--tls-cert-file <path to your client cert> \\\n\t--tls-key-file <path to your client key> \\\n\t--tls-ca-file <path to your CA> \\\n\t--ep localhost -p 5432 -u temporal -pw temporal --pl postgres --db temporal_visibility update-schema -d ./schema/postgresql/v96/visibility/versioned\n```\n\nIf you're upgrading PostgreSQL to v12 or later to enable advanced Visibility features with Temporal Server v1.20, upgrade your PostgreSQL version first, and then run `temporal-sql-tool` with the `postgres12` plugin, as shown in the following example:\n\n```bash\n./temporal-sql-tool \\\n\t--tls \\\n\t--tls-enable-host-verification \\\n\t--tls-cert-file <path to your client cert> \\\n\t--tls-key-file <path to your client key> \\\n\t--tls-ca-file <path to your CA> \\\n\t--ep localhost -p 5432 -u temporal -pw temporal --pl postgres12 --db temporal_visibility update-schema -d ./schema/postgresql/v12/visibility/versioned\n```\n\n#### MySQL\n\n**Example default schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\n./temporal-sql-tool \\\n\t--tls \\\n\t--tls-enable-host-verification \\\n\t--tls-cert-file <path to your client cert> \\\n\t--tls-key-file <path to your client key> \\\n\t--tls-ca-file <path to your CA> \\\n\t--ep localhost -p 3036 -u root -pw root --pl mysql --db temporal update-schema -d ./schema/mysql/v57/temporal/versioned/\n```\n\n**Example visibility schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\n./temporal-sql-tool \\\n\t--tls \\\n\t--tls-enable-host-verification \\\n\t--tls-cert-file <path to your client cert> \\\n\t--tls-key-file <path to your client key> \\\n\t--tls-ca-file <path to your CA> \\\n\t--ep localhost -p 3036 -u root -pw root --pl mysql --db temporal_visibility update-schema -d ./schema/mysql/v57/visibility/versioned/\n```\n\nIf you're upgrading MySQL to v8.0.17 or later to enable advanced Visibility features with Temporal Server v1.20, upgrade your MySQL version first, and then run `temporal-sql-tool` with the `mysql8` plugin, as shown in the following example:\n\n```bash\n./temporal-sql-tool \\\n\t--tls \\\n\t--tls-enable-host-verification \\\n\t--tls-cert-file <path to your client cert> \\\n\t--tls-key-file <path to your client key> \\\n\t--tls-ca-file <path to your CA> \\\n\t--ep localhost -p 5432 -u temporal -pw temporal --pl mysql8 --db temporal_visibility update-schema -d ./schema/mysql/v8/visibility/versioned.\n```\n\n### Roll-out technique\n\nWe recommend preparing a staging Cluster and then do the following to verify the upgrade is successful:\n\n1.

Some sections may be incomplete. Information may change at any time.\n\n:::\n\n:::info General company security\n\nFor information about the general security habits of Temporal Technologies see our [company security page](/temporal-technologies-inc-security).\n\n:::\n\nThe Temporal Plaform is designed with security in mind, and there are many features that you can use to keep both the Platform itself and your user's data secure.\n\nA secured Temporal Server has its network communication encrypted and has authentication and authorization protocols set up for API calls made to it.\nWithout these, your server could be accessed by unwanted entities.\n\nWhat is documented on this page are the built-in opt-in security measures that come with Temporal.\nHowever users may also choose to design their own security architecture with reverse proxies or run unsecured instances inside of a VPC environment.\n\n### Server Samples\n\nThe https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server repo offers two examples, which are further explained below:\n\n- **TLS**: how to configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure network communication with and within a Temporal cluster.\n- **Authorizer**: how to inject a low-level authorizer component that can control access to all API calls.\n\n### Encryption in transit with mTLS\n\nTemporal supports Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) as a way of encrypting network traffic between the services of a cluster and also between application processes and a Cluster.\nSelf-signed or properly minted certificates can be used for mTLS.\nmTLS is set in Temporal's [TLS configuration](/references/configuration/#tls).\nThe configuration includes two sections such that intra-Cluster and external traffic can be encrypted with different sets of certificates and settings:\n\n- `internode`: Configuration for encrypting communication between nodes in the cluster.\n- `frontend`: Configuration for encrypting the Frontend's public endpoints.\n\nA customized configuration can be passed using either the [WithConfig](/references/server-options#withconfig) or [WithConfigLoader](/references/server-options#withconfigloader) Server options.\n\nSee [TLS configuration reference](/references/configuration/#tls) for more details.\n\n### Authentication\n\nThere are a few authentication protocols available to prevent unwanted access such as authentication of servers, clients, and users.\n\n### Servers\n\nTo prevent spoofing and [MITM attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) you can specify the `serverName` in the `client` section of your respective mTLS configuration.\nThis enables established connections to authenticate the endpoint, ensuring that the server certificate presented to any connecting Client has the appropriate server name in its CN property.\nIt can be used for both `internode` and `frontend` endpoints.\n\nMore guidance on mTLS setup can be found in [the `samples-server` repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/main/tls) and you can reach out to us for further guidance.\n\n### Client connections\n\nTo restrict a client's network access to cluster endpoints you can limit it to clients with certificates issued by a specific Certificate Authority (CA).\nUse the `clientCAFiles`/ `clientCAData` and `requireClientAuth` properties in both the `internode` and `frontend` sections of the [mTLS configuration](/references/configuration/#tls).\n\n### Users\n\nTo restrict access to specific users, authentication and authorization is performed through extensibility points and plugins as described in the [Authorization](#authorization) section below.\n\n#### Authorization\n\n:::note\nInformation regarding [`Authorizer`](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin) and [`ClaimMapper`](/concepts/what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin) has been moved to another location.\n:::\n\nTemporal offers two plugin interfaces for implementing API call authorization:\n\n- [`ClaimMapper`](/concepts/what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin)\n- [`Authorizer`](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin)\n\nThe authorization and claim mapping logic is customizable, making it available to a variety of use cases and identity schemes.\nWhen these are provided the frontend invokes the implementation of these interfaces before executing the requested operation.\n\nSee https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/blob/main/extensibility/authorizer for a sample implementation.\n\n![](/diagrams/frontend-authorization-order-of-operations.png)\n\n### Single sign-on integration\n\nTemporal can be integrated with a single sign-on (SSO) experience by utilizing the `ClaimMapper` and `Authorizer` plugins.\nThe default JWT `ClaimMapper` implementation can be used as is or as a base for a custom implementation of a similar plugin.\n\n#### Temporal Web\n\nTo enable SSO for the Temporal Web UI edit the web service's configuration per the [Temporal Web README](https://github.com/temporalio/web#configuring-authentication-optional).\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"security/cluster-plugins","node":{"file_name":"cluster-plugins.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/security/cluster-plugins.md","id":"security/cluster-plugins","title":"Temporal

Mapper","tags":["term"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nThe Claim Mapper component is a pluggable component that extracts Claims from JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).\n\nThis process is achieved with the method `GetClaims`, which translates `AuthInfo` structs from the caller into `Claims` about the caller's roles within Temporal.\n\nA `Role` (within Temporal) is a bit mask that combines one or more of the role constants.\nIn the following example, the role is assigned constants that allow the caller to read and write information.\n\n```go\nrole := authorization.RoleReader | authorization.RoleWriter\n```\n\n`GetClaims` is customizable and can be modified with the `temporal.WithClaimMapper` server option.\nTemporal also offers a default JWT `ClaimMapper` for your use.\n\nA typical approach is for `ClaimMapper` to interpret custom `Claims` from a caller's JWT, such as membership in groups, and map them to Temporal roles for the user.\nThe subject information from the caller's mTLS certificate can also be a parameter in determining roles.\n\n#### `AuthInfo`\n\n`AuthInfo` is a struct that is passed to `GetClaims`. `AuthInfo` contains an authorization token extracted from the `authorization` header of the gRPC request.\n\n`AuthInfo` includes a pointer to the `pkix.Name` struct.\nThis struct contains an [x.509](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/7.5?topic=certificates-distinguished-names) Distinguished Name from the caller's mTLS certificate.\n\n#### `Claims`\n\n`Claims` is a struct that contains information about permission claims granted to the caller.\n\n`Authorizer` assumes that the caller has been properly authenticated, and trusts the `Claims` when making an authorization decision.\n\n#### Default JWT ClaimMapper\n\nTemporal offers a default JWT `ClaimMapper` that extracts the information needed to form Temporal `Claims`.\nThis plugin requires a public key to validate digital signatures.\n\nTo get an instance of the default JWT `ClaimMapper`, call `NewDefaultJWTClaimMapper` and provide it with the following:\n\n- a `TokenKeyProvider` instance\n- a `config.Authorization` pointer\n- a logger\n\nThe code for the default `ClaimMapper` can also be used to build a custom `ClaimMapper`.\n\n#### Token key provider\n\nA `TokenKeyProvider` obtains public keys from specified issuers' URIs that adhere to a specific format.\nThe default JWT `ClaimMapper` uses this component to obtain and refresh public keys over time.\n\nTemporal provides an `rsaTokenKeyProvider`.\nThis component dynamically obtains public keys that follow the [JWKS format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).\n`rsaTokenKeyProvider` uses only the `RSAKey` and `Close` methods.\n\n```go\nprovider := authorization.NewRSAKeyProvider(cfg)\n```\n\n:::note\n\n`KeySourceURIs` are the HTTP endpoints that return public keys of token issuers in the [JWKS format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).\n`RefreshInterval` defines how frequently keys should be refreshed.\nFor example, [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) exposes endpoints such as `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/.well-known/jwks.json`.\n\n:::\n\nBy default, \"permissions\" is used to name the `permissionsClaimName` value.\n\nConfigure the plugin with `config.Config.Global.Authorization.JWTKeyProvider`.\n\n#### JSON Web Token format\n\nThe default JWT `ClaimMapper` expects authorization tokens to be formatted as follows:\n\n```\nBearer <token>\n```\n\nThe Permissions Claim in the JWT Token is expected to be a collection of Individual Permission Claims.\nEach Individual Permission Claim must be formatted as follows:\n\n```\n<namespace> : <permission>\n```\n\nThese permissions are then converted into Temporal roles for the caller.\nThis can be one of Temporal's four values:\n\n- read\n- write\n- worker\n- admin\n\nMultiple permissions for the same Namespace are overridden by the `ClaimMapper`.\n\n##### Example of a payload for the default JWT ClaimMapper\n\n```\n{\n   \"permissions\":[\n      \"system:read\",\n      \"namespace1:write\"\n   ],\n   \"aud\":[\n      \"audience\"\n   ],\n   \"exp\":1630295722,\n

UI","tags":["term","web-ui"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nThe Temporal Web UI provides users with Workflow Execution state and metadata for debugging purposes.\nIt ships with every [Temporal CLI](/concepts/what-is-the-temporal-cli) release and [Docker Compose](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#docker--docker-compose) update and is available with [Temporal Cloud](/cloud).\n\nYou can configure the Temporal Web UI to work in your own environment.\nSee the [UI configuration reference](/references/web-ui-configuration).\n\nWeb UI open source repos:\n\n- [temporalio/ui](https://github.com/temporalio/ui)\n- [temporalio/ui-server](https://github.com/temporalio/ui-server)\n\nThe Web UI is packed with several features.\n\n### Namespaces\n\nAll Namespaces in your self-hosted Cluster or Temporal Cloud account are listed under **Namespaces** in the left section of the window.\nYou can also switch Namespaces from the Workflows view by selecting from the Namespace switcher at the top right corner of the window.\nAfter you select a Namespace, the Web UI shows the Recent Workflows page for that Namespace.\nIn Temporal Cloud, users can access only the Namespaces that they have been granted access to.\nFor details, see [Namespace-level permissions](/cloud/#namespace-level-permissions).\n\n### Recent Workflows\n\nRecent Workflows lists all Workflow Executions run in the past 24 hours.\nThe default number shown is 1,000 Workflow Executions.\n\nUsers can list Workflow Executions by any of the following:\n\n- Status\n- [Workflow ID](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id)\n- [Workflow Type](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type)\n- Start time\n- End time\n- A [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter)\n\nFor start time and end time, users can set their preferred date and time format as one of the following:\n\n- UTC\n- Local\n- Relative\n\nSelect a Workflow Execution to view the Workflow Execution's History, Workers, and pending Activities.\n\n#### History\n\nThis is a view of the [Events](/concepts/what-is-an-event) and Event fields within the Workflow Execution.\nApproximately [40 different Events](/references/events) can appear in a Workflow Execution's Event History.\n\nThe top of the page lists the following execution metadata:\n\n- [Workflow Type](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type)\n- [Run ID](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id)\n- Start Time and Close Time\n- [Task Queue](/concepts/what-is-a-task-queue)\n- Parent and Parent ID\n- [State Transitions](/concepts/what-is-a-state-transition)\n\nThe Input and Results section displays the function arguments and return values for debugging purposes.\nResults are not available until the Workflow finishes.\n\nThe Recent Events tab has the following views:\n\n- Timeline: A chronological or reverse-chronological order of events with a summary.\n  Clicking into an Event displays all details for that Event.\n  Clicking “Expand all” displays all Event details.\n  Similarly, clicking “Collapse all” collapses the table and displays only the summary.\n- Compact: A logical grouping of Activities, Signals and Timers.\n- JSON: The full JSON code for the workflow.\n\n#### Download Event History\n\nThe entire Workflow Execution Event History, in JSON format, can be downloaded from this section.\n\n#### Terminate Workflow\n\nWorkflow Executions can be Terminated directly from the UI.\nA custom note can be logged from the UI when that happens.\n\n#### Workers\n\nDisplays the Workers currently polling on the Workflow Task Queue with a count.\nIf no Workers are polling, an error displays.\n\n#### Pending Activities\n\nDisplays a summary of recently active and/or pending Activity Executions.\nClicking a pending Activity directs the user to the Pending Activities tab to view details.\n\n#### Stack Trace\n\nThe screen shows the captured result from the [\\_\\_stack_trace](/workflows#stack-trace-query) Query.\nThe Query is performed when the tab is selected.\nIt works only if a Worker is running and available to return the stack trace.\n\n#### Queries\n\nLists all Queries sent to the Workflow Execution.\n\n### Schedules\n\nOn Temporal Cloud and self-hosted Temporal Cluster Web UI, the Schedules page lists all the [Schedules](/workflows#schedule) created on the selected Namespace.\n\nClick a Schedule to see details, such as configured frequency, start and end times, and recent and upcoming runs.\n\n### Settings\n\nOn Temporal Cloud, **Settings** is visible only to [Global Admins](/cloud/#account-level-roles).\n\nClick **Settings** to see and manage the list of users in your account and to set up integrations such as [Observability](/cloud/how-to-monitor-temporal-cloud-metrics#configure-a-metrics-endpoint-using-temporal-cloud-ui) and [Audit logging](/cloud/how-to-manage-audit-logging).\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, manage your users, metrics, and logging in your [server configuration](/references/configuration).\n\n<!--\nAB: Commenting because this is redundant now? Also this needs to be updated for self-hosted clusters.\nDisplays the following information:\n\n- Description of the Namespace.\n- Owner: Namespace owner.\n- Global?: Whether the Namespace is a Global Namespace\n- Retention Period: Namespace Retention Period\n- History Archival: Whether History Archival is enabled\n- Visibility Archival: Whether Visibility Archival is enabled\n- Failover Version: Namespace Failover Version\n- Clusters: Cluster information -->\n\n### Archive\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, Archive shows [Archived](/concepts/what-is-archival) data of your Workflow Executions on the Namespace.\n\nTo see data in your self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you must have [Archival set up and configured](/cluster-deployment-guide#archival).\n\nFor information and details on the Archive feature in Temporal Cloud, contact your Temporal representative.\n\n### Codec Server\n\nThe Web UI can use a [Codec Server](/dataconversion#codec-server) with a custom Data Converter to decode inputs and return values.\nFor details, see [Securing your data](/production-readiness/develop#securing-your-data).\nThe UI supports both a [Codec Server endpoint](/production-readiness/develop#web-ui) and the `tctl` plugin port.\n\nFor details on setting the Codec Server endpoint, see [Codec Server setup](/production-readiness/develop#codec-server-setup).\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"/","guide_id":"web-ui","slug":"none","local_ref":"","node_id":"concepts/what-is-the-temporal-web-ui","node_title":"What

locally together with Temporal Server in [Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose): `docker exec temporal-admin-tools tctl YOUR COMMANDS HERE`\n  - To invoke [tctl](/tctl-v1) as though it is installed locally (such as `tctl namespace describe`), set an alias: `alias tctl=\"docker exec temporal-admin-tools tctl\"`\n- Run the [temporal-admin-tools](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/admin-tools) Docker image:\n  - On Linux: `docker run --rm -it --entrypoint tctl --network host --env TEMPORAL_CLI_ADDRESS=localhost:7233 temporalio/admin-tools:1.14.0`\n  - On macOS or Windows: `docker run --rm -it --entrypoint tctl --env TEMPORAL_CLI_ADDRESS=host.docker.internal:7233 temporalio/admin-tools:1.14.0`\n  - If your Temporal Server is running on a remote host, change the value of `TEMPORAL_CLI_ADDRESS`.\n  - To simplify command lines, create a `tctl` alias.\n- Build it locally:\n  1. Clone the [Temporal Server repo](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal).\n  1. Run `make tctl`.\n  1. Copy the `tctl` executable to any directory that appears in the `PATH` environment variable; for example, `/usr/bin/`.\n- Install the latest version of the tctl in your `GOPATH`: `go install github.com/temporalio/tctl/cmd/tctl@latest`\n\n**Note:** To use [tctl](/tctl-v1), you must have a Temporal Server running.\n\nTo see help for [tctl](/tctl-v1) commands, enter the following

metrics","tags":["reference"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n:::info OSS Cluster metrics\n\nThe information on this page is relevant to open source [Temporal Cluster deployments](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster).\n\nSee [Cloud metrics](/cloud/how-to-monitor-temporal-cloud-metrics) for metrics emitted by [Temporal Cloud](/concepts/what-is-temporal-cloud).\n\nSee [SDK metrics](/references/sdk-metrics) for metrics emitted by the [SDKs](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-sdk).\n\n:::\n\nA Temporal Cluster emits a range of metrics to help operators get visibility into the Cluster’s performance and to set up alerts.\n\nAll metrics emitted by the Cluster are listed in [defs.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/metrics/defs.go).\n\nFor details on setting up metrics in your Cluster configuration, see [Temporal Cluster](/references/configuration#global).\n\nThe [dashboards repository](https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards) contains community-driven Grafana dashboard templates that can be used as a starting point for monitoring the Temporal Cluster and SDK metrics.\nYou can use these templates as references to build your own dashboards.\nFor any metrics that are missing in the dashboards, use [defs.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/metrics/defs.go) as a reference.\n\nNote that, apart from these metrics emitted by the Cluster, you should also monitor infrastructure-specific metrics like CPU, memory, and network for all hosts that are running Temporal Cluster services.\n\n## Common metrics\n\nTemporal emits metrics for each gRPC service request.\nThese metrics are emitted with `type`, `operation`, and `namespace` tags, which provide visibility into Service usage and show the request rates across Services, Namespaces, and Operations.\n\n- Use the `operation` tag in your query to get request rates, error rates, or latencies per operation.\n- Use the `service_name` tag with the [service role tag values](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/bba148cf1e1642fd39fa0174423b183d5fc62d95/common/metrics/defs.go#L108) to get details for the specific service.\n\nAll common tags that you can add in your query are defined in the [defs.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/metrics/defs.go) file.\n\nFor example, to see service requests by operation on the Frontend Service, use the following:\n\n`sum by (operation) (rate(service_requests{service_name=\"frontend\"}[2m]))`\n\nNote: All metrics queries in this topic are [Prometheus queries](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).\n\nThe following list describes some metrics you can get started with.\n\n### `service_requests`\n\nShows service requests received per Task Queue.\nExample: Service requests by operation\n`sum(rate(service_requests{operation=\\\"AddWorkflowTask\\\"}[2m]))`\n\n### `service_latency`\n\nShows latencies for all Client request operations.\nUsually these are the starting point to investigate which operation is experiencing high-latency issues.\nExample: P95 service latency by operation for the Frontend Service\n`histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(service_latency_bucket{service_name=\"frontend\"}[5m])) by (operation, le))`\n\n### `service_error_with_type`\n\n(Available only in v1.17.0+) Identifies errors encountered by the service.\nExample: Service errors by type for the Frontend Service\n`sum(rate(service_errors_with_type{service_name=\"frontend\"}[5m])) by (error_type)`\n\n### `client_errors`\n\nAn indicator for connection issues between different Server roles.\nExample: Client errors\n`sum(rate(client_errors{service_name=\"frontend\",service_role=\"history\"}[5m]))`\n\nIn addition to these, you can define some service-specific metrics to get performance details for each service.\nStart with the following list, and use [defs.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/metrics/defs.go) to define additional metrics as required.\n\n## Matching Service metrics\n\n### `poll_success`\n\nShows for Tasks that are successfully matched to a poller.\nExample: `sum(rate(poll_success{}[5m]))`\n\n### `poll_timeouts`\n\nShows when no Tasks are available for the poller within the poll timeout.\nExample: `sum(rate(poll_timeouts{}[5m]))`\n\n### `asyncmatch_latency`\n\nMeasures the time from creation to delivery for async matched Tasks.\nThe larger this latency, the longer Tasks are sitting in the queue waiting for your Workers to pick them up.\nExample: `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(asyncmatch_latency_bucket{service_name=~\"matching\"}[5m])) by (operation, le))`\n\n### `no_poller_tasks`\n\nEmitted whenever a task is added to a task queue that has no poller, and is a counter metric.\nThis is usually an indicator that either the Worker or the starter programs are using the wrong Task Queue.\nUse `no_poller_tasks_per_tl` to get data per Task Queue.\n\n## History Service metrics\n\nA History Task is an internal Task in Temporal that is created as part of a transaction to update Workflow state and is processed by the Temporal History service.\nIt is critical to ensure that the History Task processing system is healthy.\nThe following key metrics can be used to monitor the History Service health:\n\n### `task_requests`\n\nEmitted on every Task process request.\nExample: `sum(rate(task_requests{service=\"$service\",operation=~\"TransferActive.*\"}[1m]))`\n\n### `task_errors`\n\nEmitted on every Task process error.\nExample: `sum(rate(task_errors{operation=~\"TransferActive.*\"}[1m]))`\n\n### `task_attempt`\n\nNumber of attempts on each Task Execution.\nA Task is retried forever, and each retry increases the attempt count.\nExample: `histogram_quantile($percentile, sum(rate(task_attempt_bucket{service=\"$service\",operation=~\"TransferActive.*\"}[1m])) by (operation, le))`\n\n### `task_latency_processing`\n\nShows the processing latency per attempt.\nExample: `histogram_quantile($percentile, sum(rate(task_latency_processing_bucket{operation=~\"TransferActive.*\",service=\"$service\", service_name=\"history\"}[1m])) by (operation, le))`\n\n### `task_latency`\n\nMeasures the in-memory latency across multiple attempts.\n\n### `task_latency_queue`\n\nMeasures the duration, end-to-end, from when the Task should be executed (from the time it was fired) to when the Task is done.\n\n### `task_latency_load`\n\n(Available only in v1.18.0+) Measures the duration from Task generation to Task loading (Task schedule to start latency for persistence queue).\n\n### `task_latency_schedule`\n\n(Available only in v1.18.0+) Measures the duration from Task submission (to the Task scheduler) to processing (Task schedule to start latency for in-memory queue).\n\n### `queue_latency_schedule`\n\n(Available only in v1.18.0+) Measures the time to schedule 100 Tasks in one Task channel in the host-level Task scheduler.\nIf fewer than 100 Tasks are in the Task channel for 30 seconds, the latency is scaled to 100 Tasks upon emission.\nNote: This is still an experimental metric and is subject to change.\n\n### `task_latency_userlatency`\n\nShows the latency introduced because of Workflow logic.\nFor example, if you have one Workflow scheduling many Activities or Child Workflows at the same time, it can cause a per-Workflow lock contention.\nThe wait period for the per-Workflow lock is counted as `userlatency`.\n\nThe `operation` tag contains details about Task type and Active versus Standby statuses, and can be used to get request rates, error rates, or latencies per operation, which can help identify issues caused by database problems.\n\n## Persistence metrics\n\nTemporal Server emits metrics for every persistence database read and write.\nSome of the most important ones are the following:\n\n### `persistence_requests`\n\nEmitted on every persistence request.\nExamples:\n\n- Prometheus query for getting the total number of persistence requests by operation for the History Service:\n  `sum by (operation) (rate(persistence_requests{service=\"$service\",service_name=\"history\"}[1m]))`\n- Prometheus query for getting the total number of persistence requests by operation for the Matching Service:\n  `sum by (operation) (rate(persistence_requests{cluster=\"$cluster\",service_name=\"matching\"}[5m]))`\n\n### `persistence_errors`\n\nShows all persistence errors.\nThis metric is a good indicator for connection issues between Temporal Cluster and the persistence store.\nExample:\n\n- Prometheus query for getting all persistence errors by service (history)\n  `sum (rate(persistence_errors{service=\"$service\",service_name=\"history\"}[1m]))`\n\n### `persistence_error_with_type`\n\nShows all errors related to the persistence store with type, and contain an `error_type` tag.\n\n- Prometheus query for getting persistence errors with type by (history) and by error type:\n  `sum(rate(persistence_error_with_type{service=\"$service\",service_name=\"history\"}[1m])) by (error_type)`\n\n### `persistence_latency`\n\nShows the latency on persistence operations.\nExample:\n\n- Prometheus query for getting latency by percentile:\n  `histogram_quantile($percentile, sum(rate(persistence_latency_bucket{service=\"$service\" service_name=\"history\"}[1m])) by (operation, le))`\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"references","guide_id":"cluster-metrics","slug":"none","local_ref":"","node_id":"references/cluster-metrics","node_title":"Temporal OSS Cluster

We plan to switch default to `opentelemetry` once its API become stable.\n- `listenAddress`: Address for Prometheus to scrape metrics from.\n  The Temporal Server uses the Prometheus client API, and the `listenAddress` configuration is used to listen for metrics.\n- `handlerPath`: Metrics handler path for scraper; default is `/metrics`.\n\n#### m3\n\nThe `m3` sections supports the following settings:\n\n- `hostPort`: The host:port of the M3 server.\n- `service`: The service tag to that this client emits.\n- `queue`: M3 reporter queue size, default is 4k.\n- `packetSize`: M3 reporter max packet size, default is 32k.\n\n### pprof\n\n- `port`: If specified, this will initialize pprof upon process start on the listed port.\n\n### tls\n\nThe `tls` section controls the SSL/TLS settings for network communication and contains two subsections, `internode` and `frontend`.\nThe `internode` section governs internal service communication among roles where the `frontend` governs SDK client communication to the Frontend Service role.\n\nEach of these subsections contain a `server` section and a `client` section.\nThe `server` contains the following parameters:\n\n- `certFile`: The path to the file containing the PEM-encoded public key of the certificate to use.\n- `keyFile`: The path to the file containing the PEM-encoded private key of the certificate to use.\n- `requireClientAuth`: _boolean_ - Requires clients to authenticate with a certificate when connecting, otherwise known as mutual TLS.\n- `clientCaFiles`: A list of paths to files containing the PEM-encoded public key of the Certificate Authorities you wish to trust for client authentication. This value is ignored if `requireClientAuth` is not enabled.\n\n:::tip\n\nSee the [server samples repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/master/tls) for sample TLS configurations.\n\n:::\n\nBelow is an example enabling Server TLS (https) between SDKs and the Frontend APIs:\n\n```yaml\nglobal:\n  tls:\n    frontend:\n      server:\n        certFile: /path/to/cert/file\n        keyFile: /path/to/key/file\n      client:\n        serverName: dnsSanInFrontendCertificate\n```\n\nNote, the `client` section generally needs to be provided to specify an expected DNS SubjectName contained in the presented server certificate via the `serverName` field; this is needed as Temporal uses IP to IP communication.\nYou can avoid specifying this if your server certificates contain the appropriate IP Subject Alternative Names.\n\nAdditionally, the `rootCaFiles` field needs to be provided when the client's host does not trust the Root CA used by the server.\nThe example below extends the above example to manually specify the Root CA used by the Frontend Services:\n\n```yaml\nglobal:\n  tls:\n    frontend:\n      server:\n        certFile: /path/to/cert/file\n        keyFile: /path/to/key/file\n      client:\n        serverName: dnsSanInFrontendCertificate\n        rootCaFiles:\n          - /path/to/frontend/server/CA/files\n```\n\nBelow is an additional example of a fully secured cluster using mutual TLS for both frontend and internode communication with manually specified CAs:\n\n```yaml\nglobal:\n  tls:\n    internode:\n      server:\n        certFile: /path/to/internode/cert/file\n        keyFile: /path/to/internode/key/file\n        requireClientAuth: true\n        clientCaFiles:\n          - /path/to/internode/serverCa\n      client:\n        serverName: dnsSanInInternodeCertificate\n        rootCaFiles:\n          - /path/to/internode/serverCa\n    frontend:\n      server:\n        certFile: /path/to/frontend/cert/file\n        keyFile: /path/to/frontend/key/file\n        requireClientAuth: true\n        clientCaFiles:\n          - /path/to/internode/serverCa\n          - /path/to/sdkClientPool1/ca\n          - /path/to/sdkClientPool2/ca\n      client:\n        serverName: dnsSanInFrontendCertificate\n        rootCaFiles:\n          - /path/to/frontend/serverCa\n```\n\n**Note:** In the case that client authentication is enabled, the `internode.server` certificate is used as the client certificate among services. This adds the following requirements:\n\n- The `internode.server` certificate must be specified on all roles, even for a frontend-only configuration.\n- Internode server certificates must be minted with either **no** Extended Key Usages or **both** ServerAuth and ClientAuth EKUs.\n- If your Certificate Authorities are untrusted, such as in the previous example, the internode server Ca will need to be specified in the following places:\n\n  - `internode.server.clientCaFiles`\n  - `internode.client.rootCaFiles`\n  - `frontend.server.clientCaFiles`\n\n## persistence\n\nThe `persistence` section holds configuration for the data store/persistence layer.\nThe following example shows a minimal specification for a password-secured Cluster using Cassandra.\n\n```yaml\npersistence:\n  defaultStore: default\n  visibilityStore: cass-visibility # The primary Visibility store.\n  secondaryVisibilityStore: es-visibility # A secondary Visibility store added to enable Dual Visibility.\n  numHistoryShards: 512\n  datastores:\n    default:\n      cassandra:\n        hosts: \"127.0.0.1\"\n        keyspace: \"temporal\"\n        user: \"username\"\n        password: \"password\"\n    cass-visibility:\n      cassandra:\n        hosts: \"127.0.0.1\"\n        keyspace: \"temporal_visibility\"\n    es-visibility:\n      elasticsearch:\n        version: \"v7\"\n        logLevel: \"error\"\n        url:\n          scheme: \"http\"\n          host: \"127.0.0.1:9200\"\n        indices:\n          visibility: temporal_visibility_v1_dev\n        closeIdleConnectionsInterval: 15s\n```\n\nThe following top level configuration items are required:\n\n### numHistoryShards\n\n_Required_ - The number of history shards to create when initializing the Cluster.\n\n**Warning**: This value is immutable and will be ignored after the first run.\nPlease ensure you set this value appropriately high enough to scale with the worst case peak load for this Cluster.\n\n### defaultStore\n\n_Required_ - The name of the data store definition that should be used by the Temporal server.\n\n### visibilityStore\n\n_Required_ - The name of the primary data store definition that should be used to set up [Visibility](/concepts/what-is-visibility) on the Temporal Cluster.\n\n### secondaryVisibilityStore\n\n_Optional_ - The name of the secondary data store definition that should be used to set up [Dual Visibility](/concepts/what-is-dual-visibility) on the Temporal Cluster.\n\n### datastores\n\n_Required_ - contains named data store definitions to be referenced.\n\nEach definition is defined with a heading declaring a name (ie: `default:` and `visibility:` above), which contains a data store definition.\n\nData store definitions must be either `cassandra` or `sql`.\n\n#### cassandra\n\nA `cassandra` data store definition can contain the following values:\n\n- `hosts`: _Required_ - \",\" separated Cassandra endpoints, e.g. \"192.168.1.2,192.168.1.3,192.168.1.4\".\n- `port`: Default: 9042 - Cassandra port used for connection by `gocql` client.\n- `user`: Cassandra username used for authentication by `gocql` client.\n- `password`: Cassandra password used for authentication by `gocql` client.\n- `keyspace`: _Required_ - the Cassandra keyspace.\n- `datacenter`: The data center filter arg for Cassandra.\n- `maxConns`: The max number of connections to this data store for a single TLS configuration.\n- `tls`: See TLS below.\n\n#### sql\n\nA `sql` data store definition can contain the following values:\n\n- `user`: Username used for authentication.\n- `password`: Password used for authentication.\n- `pluginName`: _Required_ - SQL database type.\n  - _Valid values_: `mysql` or `postgres`.\n- `databaseName` - _required_ - the name of SQL database to connect to.\n- `connectAddr` - _required_ - the remote address of the database, e.g. \"192.168.1.2\".\n- `connectProtocol` - _required_ - the protocol that goes with the `connectAddr`\n  - _Valid values_: `tcp` or `unix`\n- `connectAttributes` - a map of key-value attributes to be sent as part of connect `data_source_name` url.\n- `maxConns` - the max number of connections to this data store.\n- `maxIdleConns` - the max number of idle connections to this data store\n- `maxConnLifetime` - is the maximum time a connection can be alive.\n- `tls` - See below.\n\n#### tls\n\nThe `tls` and `mtls` sections can contain the following values:\n\n- `enabled` - _boolean_.\n- `serverName` - name of the server hosting the data store.\n- `certFile` - path to the cert file.\n- `keyFile` - path to the key file.\n- `caFile` - path to the ca file.\n- `enableHostVerification` - _boolean_ - `true` to verify the hostname and server cert (like a wildcard for Cassandra cluster). This option is basically the inverse of `InSecureSkipVerify`. See `InSecureSkipVerify` in http://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/ for more info.\n\nNote: `certFile` and `keyFile` are optional depending on server config, but both fields must be omitted to avoid using a client certificate.\n\n## log\n\nThe `log` section is optional and contains the following possible values:\n\n- `stdout` - _boolean_ - `true` if the output needs to go to standard out.\n- `level` - sets the logging level.\n  - _Valid values_ - debug, info, warn, error or fatal, default to info.\n- `outputFile` - path to output log file.\n\n## clusterMetadata\n\n`clusterMetadata` contains the local cluster information. The information is used in [Multi-Cluster Replication](/concepts/what-is-multi-cluster-replication).\n\nAn example `clusterMetadata` section:\n\n```yaml\nclusterMetadata:\n  enableGlobalNamespace: false\n  failoverVersionIncrement: 10\n  masterClusterName: \"active\"\n  currentClusterName: \"active\"\n  clusterInformation:\n    active:\n      enabled: true\n      initialFailoverVersion: 0\n      rpcAddress: \"127.0.0.1:7233\"\n  #replicationConsumer:\n  #type: kafka\n```\n\n- `currentClusterName` - _required_ - the name of the current cluster. **Warning**: This value is immutable and will be ignored after the first run.\n- `enableGlobalNamespace` - _Default:_ `false`.\n- `replicationConsumer` - determines which method to use to consume replication tasks. The type may be either `kafka` or `rpc`.\n- `failoverVersionIncrement` - the increment of each cluster version when failover happens.\n- `masterClusterName` - the master cluster name, only the master cluster can register/update namespace. All clusters can do namespace failover.\n- `clusterInformation` - contains the local cluster name to `ClusterInformation` definition. The local cluster name should be consistent with `currentClusterName`. `ClusterInformation` sections consist of:\n  - `enabled` - _boolean_ - whether a remote cluster is enabled for replication.\n  - `initialFailoverVersion`\n  - `rpcAddress` - indicate the remote service address (host:port). Host can be DNS name. Use `dns:///` prefix to enable round-robin between IP address for DNS name.\n\n## services\n\nThe `services` section contains configuration keyed by service role type.\nThere are four supported service roles:\n\n- `frontend`\n- `matching`\n- `worker`\n- `history`\n\nBelow is a minimal example of a `frontend` service definition under `services`:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  frontend:\n    rpc:\n      grpcPort: 8233\n      membershipPort: 8933\n      bindOnIP: \"0.0.0.0\"\n```\n\nThere are two sections defined under each service heading:\n\n### rpc\n\n_Required_\n\n`rpc` contains settings related to the way a service interacts with other services. The following values are supported:\n\n- `grpcPort`: Port on which gRPC will listen.\n- `membershipPort`: Port used to communicate with other hosts in the same Cluster for membership info.\n  Each service should use different port.\n  If there are multiple Temporal Clusters in your environment (Kubernetes for example), and they have network access to each other, each Cluster should use a different membership port.\n- `bindOnLocalHost`: Determines whether uses `127.0.0.1` as the listener address.\n- `bindOnIP`: Used to bind service on specific IP, or `0.0.0.0`.\n  Check `net.ParseIP` for supported syntax, only IPv4 is supported, mutually exclusive with `BindOnLocalHost` option.\n\n**Note**: Port values are currently expected to be consistent among role types across all hosts.\n\n## publicClient\n\nThe `publicClient` a required section describing the configuration needed to for worker to connect to Temporal server for background server maintenance.\n\n- `hostPort` IPv4 host port or DNS name to reach Temporal frontend, [reference](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md)\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\npublicClient:\n  hostPort: \"localhost:8933\"\n```\n\nUse `dns:///` prefix to enable round-robin between IP address for DNS name.\n\n## archival\n\n_Optional_\n\nArchival is an optional configuration needed to set up the [Archival store](/concepts/what-is-archival).\nIt can be enabled on `history` and `visibility` data.\n\nThe following list describes supported values for each configuration on the `history` and `visibility` data.\n\n- `state`: State for Archival setting. Supported values are `enabled`, `disabled`. This value must be `enabled` to use Archival with any Namespace in your Cluster.\n  - `enabled`: Enables Archival in your Cluster setup. When set to `enabled`, `URI` and `namespaceDefaults` values must be provided.\n  - `disabled`: Disables Archival in your Cluster setup. When set to `disabled`, the `enableRead` value must be set to `false`, and under `namespaceDefaults`, `state` must be set to `disabled`, with no values set for `provider` and `URI` fields.\n- `enableRead`: Supported values are `true` or `false`. Set to `true` to allow read operations from the archived Event History data.\n- `provider`: Location where data should be archived. Subprovider configs are `filestore`, `gstorage`, `s3`, or `your_custom_provider`. Default configuration specifies `filestore`.\n\nExample:\n\n- To enable Archival in your Cluster configuration:\n\n  ```yaml\n  # Cluster-level Archival config enabled\n  archival:\n    # Event History configuration\n    history:\n      # Archival is enabled for the History Service data.\n      state: \"enabled\"\n      enableRead: true\n      # Namespaces can use either the local filestore provider or the Google Cloud provider.\n      provider:\n        filestore:\n          fileMode: \"0666\"\n          dirMode: \"0766\"\n        gstorage:\n          credentialsPath: \"/tmp/gcloud/keyfile.json\"\n    # Configuration for archiving Visibility data.\n    visibility:\n      # Archival is enabled for Visibility data.\n      state: \"enabled\"\n      enableRead: true\n      provider:\n        filestore:\n          fileMode: \"0666\"\n          dirMode: \"0766\"\n  ```\n\n- To disable Archival in your Cluster configuration:\n\n  ```yaml\n  # Cluster-level Archival config disabled\n  archival:\n    history:\n      state: \"disabled\"\n      enableRead: false\n    visibility:\n      state: \"disabled\"\n      enableRead: false\n\n  namespaceDefaults:\n    archival:\n      history:\n        state: \"disabled\"\n      visibility:\n        state: \"disabled\"\n  ```\n\nFor more details on Archival setup, see [Set up Archival](/cluster-deployment-guide#set-up-archival).\n\n## namespaceDefaults\n\n_Optional_\n\nSets default Archival configuration for each Namespace using `namespaceDefaults` for `history` and `visibility` data.\n\n- `state`: Default state of the Archival for the Namespace. Supported values are `enabled` or `disabled`.\n- `URI`: Default URI for the Namespace.\n\nFor more details on setting Namespace defaults on Archival, see [Namespace creation in Archival setup](/cluster-deployment-guide#namespace-creation)\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\n# Default values for a Namespace if none are provided at creation.\nnamespaceDefaults:\n  # Archival defaults.\n  archival:\n    # Event History defaults.\n    history:\n      state: \"enabled\"\n      # New Namespaces will default to the local provider.\n      URI: \"file:///tmp/temporal_archival/development\"\n    visibility:\n      state: \"disabled\"\n      URI: \"file:///tmp/temporal_vis_archival/development\"\n```\n\n## dcRedirectionPolicy\n\n_Optional_\n\nContains the Frontend datacenter API redirection policy that you can use for cross-DC replication.\n\nSupported values:\n\n- `policy`: Supported values are `noop`, `selected-apis-forwarding`, and `all-apis-forwarding`.\n  - `noop`: Not setting a value or setting `noop` means no redirection. This is the default value.\n  - `selected-apis-forwarding`: Sets up forwarding for the following APIs to the active Cluster based on the Namespace.\n    - `StartWorkflowExecution`\n    - `SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution`\n    - `SignalWorkflowExecution`\n    - `RequestCancelWorkflowExecution`\n    - `TerminateWorkflowExecution`\n    - `QueryWorkflow`\n  - `all-apis-forwarding`: Sets up forwarding for all APIs on the Namespace in the active Cluster.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\n#...\ndcRedirectionPolicy:\n  policy: \"selected-apis-forwarding\"\n#...\n```\n\n## dynamicConfigClient\n\n_Optional_\n\nConfiguration for setting up file-based [dynamic configuration](/concepts/what-is-cluster-configuration#dynamicconfiguration) client for the Cluster.\n\nThis setting is required if specifying dynamic configuration. Supported configuration values are as follows:\n\n- `filepath`: Specifies the path where the dynamic configuration YAML file is stored. The path should be relative to the root directory.\n- `pollInterval`: Interval between the file-based client polls to check for dynamic configuration updates. The minimum period you can set is 5 seconds.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\ndynamicConfigClient:\n  filepath: \"config/dynamicconfig/development-cass.yaml\"\n  pollInterval: \"10s\"\n```\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"references","guide_id":"configuration","slug":"none","local_ref":"","node_id":"references/configuration","node_title":"Temporal Cluster configuration reference","node_description":"Much of the behavior of a Temporal Cluster is configured using the `development.yaml` file."}]},{"file_name":"dynamic-configuration.md","id":"dynamic-configuration","file_dir":"references","title":"Temporal Cluster dynamic configuration reference","sidebar_label":"Dynamic configuration","description":"Temporal Cluster provides dynamic configuration keys that you can update and apply to a running Cluster without restarting your services.","toc_max_heading_level":4,"add_tabs_support":false,"sections":[{"type":"p","id":"references/dynamic-configuration","node":{"file_name":"dynamic-configuration.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/references/dynamic-configuration.md","id":"references/dynamic-configuration","title":"Dynamic configuration reference","description":"Dynamic configuration key values can be set to override the default values in a Cluster configuration.","label":"Dynamic configuration","tags":["reference"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTemporal Cluster provides [dynamic configuration](/concepts/what-is-cluster-configuration#dynamic-configuration) keys that you can update and apply to a running Cluster without restarting your services.\n\nThe dynamic configuration keys are set with default values when you create your Cluster configuration.\nYou can override these values as you test your Cluster setup for optimal performance according to your workload requirements.\n\nFor the complete list of dynamic configuration keys, see <https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/dynamicconfig/constants.go>.\nEnsure that you check server release notes for any changes to these keys and values.\n\nFor the default values of dynamic configuration keys, check the following links:\n\n- [Frontend Service](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/5783e781504d8ffac59f9848b830868f3139b980/service/frontend/service.go#L176)\n- [History Service](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/5783e781504d8ffac59f9848b830868f3139b980/service/history/configs/config.go#L309)\n- [Matching Service](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/5783e781504d8ffac59f9848b830868f3139b980/service/matching/config.go#L125)\n- [Worker Service](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/5783e781504d8ffac59f9848b830868f3139b980/service/worker/service.go#L193)\n\nSetting dynamic configuration is optional.\nChange these values only if you need to override the default values to achieve better performance on your Temporal Cluster.\nAlso, ensure that you test your changes before setting these in production.\n\n## Format\n\nTo override the default dynamic configuration values, specify your custom values and constraints for the dynamic configuration keys that you want to change in a YAML configuration file.\nUse the following format when creating your dynamic configuration file.\n\n```yaml\ntestGetBoolPropertyKey:\n  - value: false\n  - value: true\n    constraints:\n      namespace: \"your-namespace\"\n  - value: false\n    constraints:\n      namespace: \"your-other-namespace\"\ntestGetDurationPropertyKey:\n  - value: \"1m\"\n    constraints:\n      namespace: \"your-namespace\"\n      taskQueueName: \"longIdleTimeTaskqueue\"\ntestGetFloat64PropertyKey:\n  - value: 12.0\n    constraints:\n      namespace: \"your-namespace\"\ntestGetMapPropertyKey:\n  - value:\n      key1: 1\n      key2: \"value 2\"\n      key3:\n        - false\n        - key4: true\n          key5: 2.0\n```\n\n### Constraints\n\nYou can define constraints on some dynamic configuration keys to set specific values that apply on a Namespace or Task Queue level.\nNot defining constraints on a dynamic configuration key sets the values across the Cluster.\n\n- To set global values for the configuration key with no constraints, use the following:\n\n  ```yaml\n  frontend.globalNamespaceRPS: # Total per-Namespace RPC rate limit applied across the Cluster.\n    - value: 5000\n  ```\n\n- For keys that can be customized at Namespace level, you can specify multiple values for different Namespaces in addition to one default value that applies globally to all Namespaces.\n  To set values at a Namespace level, use `namespace` (String) as shown in the following example.\n\n  ```yaml\n  frontend.persistenceNamespaceMaxQPS: # Rate limit on the number of queries the Frontend sends to the Persistence store.\n    - constraints: {} # Sets default value that applies to all Namespaces\n      value: 2000 # The default value for this key is 0.\n    - constraints: {namespace: \"namespace1\"} # Sets limit on number of queries that can be sent from \"namespace1\" Namespace to the Persistence store.\n      value: 4000\n    - constraints: {namespace: \"namespace2\"}\n      value: 1000\n  ```\n\n- For keys that can be customized at a Task Queue level, you can specify Task Queue name and Task type in addition to Namespace.\n  To set values at a Task Queue level, use `taskQueueName` (String) with `taskType` (optional; supported values: `Workflow` and `Activity`).\n\n  For example if you have Workflow Executions creating a large number of Workflow and Activity tasks per second, you can add more partitions to your Task Queues (default is 4) to handle the high throughput of tasks.\n  To do this, add the following to your dynamic configuration file.\n  Note that if changing the number of partitions, you must set the same count for both read and write operations on Task Queues.\n\n  ```yaml\n  matching.numTaskqueueReadPartitions: # Number of Task Queue partitions for read operations.\n  - constraints: {namespace: \"namespace1\", taskQueueName: \"tq\"}  # Applies to the \"tq\" Task Queue for both Workflows and Activities.\n    value: 8 # The default value for this key is 4. Task Queues that need to support high traffic require higher number of partitions.

ways](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster).\nWe recommend this approach for a limited number of situations.\n\n```go\ns := temporal.NewServer()\nerr := s.Start()\nif err != nil{\n\tlog.Fatal(err)\n}\n```\n\n`NewServer()` accepts functions as parameters.\nEach function returns a `ServerOption` that is applied to the instance.\nSource code for parameter reference is here: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/temporal/server_option.go\n\n### WithConfig\n\nOverrides the default configuration with a custom configuration that is defined in the config package

the server on the signal from that channel.\n\n- If `temporal.InterruptOn()` is not passed, `server.Start()` is never blocked and you need to call `server.Stop()` somewhere.\n- If `temporal.InterruptOn(nil)` is passed, `server.Start()` blocks forever until the process is killed.\n- If `temporal.InterruptOn(temporal.InterruptCh())` is passed, `server.Start()` blocks until you use Ctrl+C, which then gracefully shuts the server down.\n- If `temporal.Interrupt(someCustomChan)` is passed, `server.Start()` blocks until a signal is sent to `someCustomChan`.\n\n```go\ns := temporal.NewServer(\n\ttemporal.InterruptOn(temporal.InterruptCh()),\n)\n```\n\n### WithAuthorizer\n\nSets a low level [authorization mechanism](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin) that determines

data","tags":["guide-context","production-readiness"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTemporal Server stores and persists the data handled in your Workflow Execution.\nEncrypting this data ensures that any sensitive application data is secure when handled by the Temporal Server.\n\nFor example, if you have sensitive information passed in the following objects that are persisted in the Workflow Execution Event History, use encryption to secure it:\n\n- Inputs and outputs/results in your [Workflow](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution), [Activity](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution), and [Child Workflow](/concepts/what-is-a-child-workflow-execution)\n- [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal) inputs\n- [Memo](/concepts/what-is-a-memo)\n- Headers (verify if applicable to your SDK)\n- [Query](/concepts/what-is-a-query) inputs and results\n- Results of [Local Activities](/concepts/what-is-a-local-activity) and [Side Effects](/concepts/what-is-a-side-effect)\n- [Application errors and failures](/kb/failures)\n\n  Failure messages and stack traces are not encoded as codec-capable Payloads by default; you must explicitly enable encoding these common attributes on failures. For more details, see [Failure Converter](/concepts/what-is-a-failure-converter).\n\nUsing encryption ensures that your sensitive data exists unencrypted only on the Client and the Worker Process that is executing the Workflows and Activities, on hosts that you control.\n\nBy default, your data is serialized to a [Payload](/concepts/what-is-a-payload) by a [Data Converter](/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter).\nTo encrypt your Payload, configure your custom encryption logic with a [Payload Codec](/concepts/what-is-a-payload-codec) and set it with a [custom Data Converter](/concepts/what-is-a-custom-data-converter).\n\nA Payload Codec does byte-to-byte conversion to transform your Payload (for example, by implementing compression and/or encryption and decryption) and is an optional step that happens between the wire and the [Payload Converter](/concepts/what-is-a-payload-converter):\n\n```bash\nUser code <--> Payload Converter <--> Payload Codec <--> Wire <--> Temporal Server\n```\n\nYou can run your Payload Codec with a [Codec Server](/concepts/what-is-a-codec-server) and use the Codec Server endpoints in Web UI and tctl to decode your encrypted Payload locally.\nFor details on how to set up a Codec Server, see [Codec Server setup](/prod-readiness-context/how-to-set-up-codec-server).\n\nHowever, if you plan to set up [remote data encoding](/concepts/what-is-remote-data-encoding) for your data, ensure that you consider all security implications of running encryption remotely before implementing it.\n\nIn codec implementations, we recommend running the function (such as compression or encryption) on the entire input Payload and putting the result in the data field of a new Payload with a different encoding metadata field.\nUsing this technique ensures that the input Payload's metadata is preserved.\nWhen the encoded Payload is sent to be decoded, you can verify the metadata field before applying the decryption.\nIf your Payload is _not_ encoded, we recommend passing the unencoded data to the decode function instead of failing the conversion.\n\nExamples for implementing encryption:\n\n- [Go

[PayloadCodec](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#PayloadCodec) implementation and define your encryption/compression and decryption/decompression logic in the `Encode` and `Decode` functions.\n\nThe Payload Codec converts bytes to bytes.\nIt must be used in an instance of [CodecDataConverter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#CodecDataConverter) that wraps a Data Converter to do the [Payload](/concepts/what-is-a-payload) conversions, and applies the custom encoding and decoding in `PayloadCodec` to the converted Payloads.\n\nThe following example from the [Data Converter sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/main/codec-server/data_converter.go) shows how to create a custom `NewCodecDataConverter` that wraps an instance of a Data Converter with a custom `PayloadCodec`.\n\n```go\n// Create an instance of Data Converter with your codec.\nvar DataConverter = converter.NewCodecDataConverter(\n\tconverter.GetDefaultDataConverter(),\n\tNewPayloadCodec(),\n)\n//...\n// Create an instance of PaylodCodec.\nfunc NewPayloadCodec() converter.PayloadCodec {\n\treturn &Codec{}\n}\n```\n\nImplement your encryption/compression logic in the `Encode` function and the decryption/decompression logic in the `Decode` function in your custom `PayloadCodec`, as shown in the following example.\n\n```go\n// Codec implements converter.PayloadEncoder for snappy compression.\ntype Codec struct{}\n\n// Encode implements converter.PayloadCodec.Encode.\nfunc (Codec)

err\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn result, nil\n}\n```\n\n**Set Data Converter to use custom Payload Codec**\n\nSet your custom `PayloadCodec` with an instance of `DataConverter` in your `Dial` client options that you use to create the client.\n\nThe following example shows how to set your custom Data Converter from a package called `mycodecpackage`.\n\n```go\n//...\nc, err := client.Dial(client.Options{\n\t\t// Set DataConverter here to ensure that Workflow inputs and results are\n\t\t// encoded as required.\n\t\tDataConverter: mycodecpackage.DataConverter,\n\t})\n//...\n```\n\nFor reference, see the following samples:\n\n- [Codec server](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server)\n-

options that you use in your Worker process and to start your Workflow Executions.\n\nFor example, to set a custom `PayloadCodec` implementation with `DefaultDataConverter`, use the following code:\n\n```java\nWorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();\n  // Client that can be used to start and signal Workflows\n  WorkflowClient client =\n      WorkflowClient.newInstance(\n          service,\n          WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder()\n              .setDataConverter(\n                  new CodecDataConverter(\n                      DefaultDataConverter.newDefaultInstance(),\n                      Collections.singletonList(new YourCustomPayloadCodec()))) // Sets the custom Payload Codec created in the previous example with an instance of the default Data Converter.\n              .build());\n```\n\nFor example implementations, see the following samples:\n\n- [Encrypted Payloads](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/main/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/encryptedpayloads)\n- [Remote Data Encoder and Codec

setup","tags":["security","how-to"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nUse a Codec Server to decode your encoded [payloads](/concepts/what-is-a-payload) and integrate it with the Temporal Web UI and CLI commands when debugging your Workflows.\n\nA Codec Server is an HTTP or HTTPS Server that you create and host.\nIt must be configured to use a [Payload Codec](/concepts/what-is-a-payload-codec) with the required decode logic and encryption keys.\nTemporal Cloud requires an HTTPS Codec Server.\n\nThe Codec Server is independent of the Temporal Server and decodes your encrypted payloads through endpoints.\nWhen you set the codec endpoint in the Temporal Web UI, the Web UI uses the remote endpoint to send encoded payloads to the Codec Server and receive decoded payloads from the Codec Server.\nSee [API contract requirements](#api-contract-specifications).\nDecoded payloads are then displayed in the Workflow Execution Event History on the Web UI.\n\nNote that when you use a Codec Server, the decoded payloads are visible only to you on the Web UI; payloads on the Temporal Server (whether on Temporal Cloud or a self-hosted Temporal Cluster) remain encrypted.\n\nBecause you create, operate, and manage access to your Codec Server in your controlled environment, ensure that you consider the following:\n\n- When you set your codec endpoint with your Web UI, expect your Codec Server to receive a large number of requests per Workflow Execution from the Web UI.\n- Ensure that you secure access your Codec Server.\n  For details, see [Authorization](#authorization).\n- The Temporal Web UI only displays the decoded payloads received from your Codec Server in real-time; it does not store or send the data back to the Temporal Server (whether on Cloud or self-hosted Temporal Cluster).\n- You might have latencies introduced in the Web UI when sending and receiving payloads to the Codec Server.\n\nTo create a Codec Server, you need the following components:\n\n- A [Payload Codec](/concepts/what-is-a-payload-codec) with the requisite keys and logic to decode your encrypted payloads.\n  You can use the Payload Codec that you applied with your Data Converter to encode your Payloads and configure it with your Codec Server.\n  However, if you are writing your Codec Server in a different SDK from the one that applies the Data Converter, ensure that your logic and keys are correctly replicated.\n- Key management infrastructure or plan for sharing your encryption keys between the Workers and your Codec Server.\n- [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) configuration on the HTTP/HTTPS endpoints in your Codec Server for sending and receiving requests from the Temporal Web UI.\n- Optional: Secure access through VPN and access control.\n  For details, see [Authorization](#authorization).\n\nFor examples on how to create your Codec Server, see following Codec Server implementation samples:\n\n- [Go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server)\n- [Java](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/tree/master/temporal-remote-data-encoder)\n- [Python](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/blob/main/encryption/codec_server.py)\n- [TypeScript](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/encryption/src/codec-server.ts)\n\n### API contract specifications\n\nWhen you create your Codec Server to handle requests from the Web UI, the following requirements must be met.\n\n#### Endpoints\n\nThe [Web UI/CLI calls the POST method with the /decode endpoint](https://github.com/temporalio/ui/blob/11ef7ddb47711444a365c7760eae41853446da07/src/lib/services/data-encoder.ts#L38).\n\nIn your Codec Server, create a `/decode` path and pass the incoming payload to the decode method in your Payload Codec.\n\nYou can also add a [verification step](#authorization) to check whether the incoming request has the required authorization to access the decode logic in your Payload Codec.\n\n#### Headers\n\nEach request from the Web UI to your Codec Server includes the following headers:\n\n- `Content-Type: application/json`: Ensure that your Codec Server can accommodate this [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types).\n\n- `X-Namespace: {namespace}`: This is a custom HTTP Header. Ensure that the [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) configuration in your Codec Server includes this header.\n\n- [Optional] `Authorization: <credentials>`: Include this in your CORS configuration when enabling authorization with your Codec Server.\n\nFor details on setting up authorization, see [Authorization](#authorization).\n\n#### Request body\n\nThe general specification for the `POST` request body contains payloads.\nBy default, all field values in your payload are base64 encoded, regardless of whether they are encrypted by your custom codec implementation.\n\nThe following example shows a sample `POST` request body with base64 encoding.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"payloads\": [{\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"encoding\": <base64EncodedEncodingHint>\n    },\n    \"data\": <encryptedPayloadData>\n  }, ...]\n}\n```\n\n#### CORS\n\nEnable [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) requests on your Codec Server to receive HTTP/HTTPS requests from the Temporal Web UI.\n\nAt a minimum, enable the following responses from your Codec Server to allow requests coming from the Temporal Web UI:\n\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`\n\nFor example, for Temporal Cloud Web UI hosted at https://cloud.temporal.io, enable the following in your Codec Server:\n\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://cloud.temporal.io`\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS`\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Namespace, Content-Type`\n\nFor details on what a sample request/response looks like from the Temporal Web UI, see [Sample Request/Response](#sample-requestresponse).\nIf setting authorization, include `Authorization` in your `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.\nFor details on setting up authorization, see [Authorization](#authorization).\n\n#### Authorization\n\nTo enable authorization from the Web UI (for both self-hosted Cluster and Temporal Cloud), your Codec Server must be an HTTPS Server.\n\n**Temporal Cloud**\n\nThe Temporal Cloud UI provides an option to pass access tokens (JWT) to your Codec Server endpoints.\nUse the access tokens to validate access and then return decoded payloads from the Codec Server.\n\nYou can enable this by selecting **Pass access token** in your Codec Server endpoint interface where you add your endpoint.\nEnabling this option in the Temporal Cloud UI adds an authorization header to each request sent to the Codec Server endpoint that you set.\n\nIn your Codec Server implementation, verify the signature on this access token (in your authorization header) against the JWKS endpoint provided to you.\n\n<!--Update: the JWKS link is provided in the UI onboarding content for now.\nIs this process defined? when a customer signs up for temporal cloud, do we provide them with the JWKS as part of the onboarding process? also the JWKS endpoint is rate-limited - something we should call out when providing the link to users.-->\n\n<!-- Commenting this for now.-->\n<!--If you want to unpack the claims in your token to add additional checks on whether the user has valid access to the Namespace and payloads they are trying to access, you can implement it using Auth0 SDKs, middleware, or one of the third-party libraries at JWT.io.-->\n\nThe token provided from Temporal Cloud UI contains the email identifier of the person requesting access to the payloads.\nBased on the permissions you have provided to the user in your access control systems, set conditions in your Codec Server whether to return decoded payloads or just return the original encoded payloads.\n\n**Self-hosted Temporal Cluster**\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, configure [authorization in the Web UI configuration](/references/web-ui-configuration#auth) in your Temporal Cluster setup.\n\nWith this enabled, you can pass access tokens to your Codec Server and validate the requests from the Web UI to the Codec Server endpoints that you set.\n\nNote that with self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you must explicitly configure authorization specifications for the Web UI and CLI.\n\nThe following sample provides implementation examples for applying authentication on your Codec Server using the Go SDK.\n\n- [Codec Server](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server)\n\n#### Sample request/response\n\nConsider the following sample request/response when creating and hosting a Codec Server with the following specifications:\n\n- Scheme: `https`\n- Host: `dev.mydomain.com/codec`\n- Path: `/decode`\n\n```json\nHTTP/1.1 POST /decode\nHost: https://dev.mydomain.com/codec\nContent-Type: application/json\nX-Namespace: myapp-dev.acctid123\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n\n{\"payloads\":[{\"metadata\":{\"encoding\":\"anNvbi9wcm90b2J1Zg==\",\"messageType\":\"dGVtcG9yYWxfc2hvcC5vcmNoZXN0cmF0aW9ucy52MS5TdGFydFNob3BwaW5nQ2FydFJlcXVlc3Q=\"},\"data\":\"eyJjYXJ0SWQiOiJleGFtcGxlLWNhcnQiLCJzaG9wcGVySWQiOiJ5b3VyLXNob3BwZXItaWQtZXhhbXBsZSIsImVtYWlsIjoieW91ci1lbWFpbEBkb21haW4uY29tIn0\"}]}\n\n200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"payloads\": [{\n    \"metadata\":{\n      \"encoding\": \"json/protobuf\",\n      \"messageType\": \"temporal_shop.orchestrations.v1.StartShoppingCartRequest\"\n    },\n    \"data\":{\n      \"cartId\":\"example-cart\",\n      \"shopperId\":\"your-shopper-id-example\",\n      \"email\":\"your-email@domain.com\"\n    }}]\n}\n```\n\n### Hosting your Codec Server\n\nYour Codec Server can be hosted at an organization level or locally.\n\n#### Organization-level hosting\n\nHosting the Codec Server for your organization simplifies both key management used for decryption and versioning the codec itself.\nConsider the following details for a multi-tenant approach to setting up your Codec Server:\n\n- Ingress: Your server will require ingress configuration for your users to access the server.\n- Authorization: You must set explicit authorization checks to validate requests to your Codec Server.\n\n#### Local hosting\n\nLocally hosting the Codec Server is simpler to get started.\nHowever, consider the following before choosing to do so:\n\n- A single URL configuration is accepted for the Cloud account.\n  This means some agreed-upon policy on the URL must be made for everyone using the Namespaces in this account.\n  For example, if you configure your remote codec endpoint to be http://localhost:8080/codec, every developer must host your Codec Server locally at that port.\n\n  Alternatively, you can use the local `hosts` file to allow each developer to choose where to host.\n  For example, configure the remote codec endpoint as http://codec.server and allow each developer to control what it maps to locally.\n\n- Distributing encryption keys that can decrypt the payloads at your organization can be a security risk.\n\n### Set your Codec Server endpoints with Web UI and CLI\n\nAfter you create your Codec Server and expose the requisite endpoints, set the endpoints in your Web UI and CLI.\n\n#### Web UI\n\nOn Temporal Cloud and self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you can configure a Codec Server endpoint to be used for a Namespace in the Web UI.\n\n![Codec Server endpoint Namespace setting](/img/set-codec-endpoint-form.png)\n\nTo set a Codec Server endpoint on a Namespace, do the following.\n\n1. In the Web UI, go to Namespaces, select the Namespace where you want to configure the Codec Server endpoint, and click **Edit**.\n1. In the **Codec Server** section on the Namespace configuration page, enter your Codec Server endpoint and port number.\n1. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [authenticate requests](#authorization) from Temporal Web UI, enable **Pass access token** to send a JWT access token with the HTTPS requests.\n1. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [verify origins of requests](#cors), enable **Include cross-origin credentials**.\n\nSetting a Codec Server endpoint on a Namespace enables it for all users on the Namespace.\nOn Temporal Cloud, you must have [Namespace Admin privileges](/cloud/#namespace-level-permissions) to add a Codec Server endpoint on the Namespace.\n\nAll users on a Namespace have the option to override the Namespace-level setting at the browser level.\nOverriding the Namespace-level endpoint only affects your browser.\nThis can be useful when developing, testing, or troubleshooting encoding functionality.\n\n![Codec Server endpoint browser setting](/img/data-encoder-button.png)\n\nTo set a browser override for the Namespace-level endpoint, do the following.\n\n1. Navigate to **Workflows** in your Namespace.\n2. In the top-right corner, select **Configure Codec Server**.\n3. Select whether you want to use the Namespace-level (or Cluster-level for self-hosted Cluster) or the browser-level Codec Endpoint setting as the default for your browser.\n   In Temporal Cloud:\n   - **Use Namespace-level settings, where available. Otherwise, use my browser setting.**\n     Uses the Namespace-level Codec Server endpoint by default.\n     If no endpoint is set on the Namespace, your browser setting is applied.\n   - **Use my browser setting and ignore Namespace-level setting.**\n     Applies your browser-level setting by default, overriding the Namespace-level Codec Server endpoint.\n4. Enter your Codec Server endpoint and port number.\n5. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [authenticate requests](#authorization) from Temporal Web UI, enable **Pass access token** to send a JWT access token with the HTTPS requests.\n6. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [verify origins of requests](#cors), enable **Include cross-origin credentials**.\n\nIn self-hosted Temporal Clusters where you set up your UI Server, you can also set the codec endpoint in the UI server [configuration file](/references/web-ui-configuration#codec), as shown in the following example.\n\n```yaml\ncodec:\n    endpoint: {{ default .Env.TEMPORAL_CODEC_ENDPOINT \"{namespace}\"}}\n```\n\nStart the UI server to use this endpoint on the Web UI for decoding data in Workflow Executions in the specified Namespace.\n\n#### CLI\n\nIn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, after the Codec Server is started, provide the exposed endpoint to CLI using the `--codec_endpoint` command option.\n\nFor example, if you are running your Codec Server locally and expose port 8888 as your endpoint, run the following command to set the codec endpoint globally.\n\n```bash\ntemporal env set --codec-endpoint \"http://localhost:8888\"\n```\n\nIf your codec endpoint is not set globally, use the `--codec-endpoint` option with your CLI commands.\nFor example, to see the decoded output of the Workflow Execution \"yourWorkflow\" in the Namespace \"yourNamespace\", run the following command.\n\n```bash\ntemporal --codec-endpoint \"http://localhost:8888\" --namespace \"yourNamespace\" workflow show --workflow-id \"yourWorkflow\"  --run-id \"<yourRunId>\" --output \"table\"\n```\n\nFor details, see the [CLI reference](/cli/).\n\nCurrently in Temporal Cloud, you can set the Codec Server endpoint only from the Web UI.\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"/production-readiness","guide_id":"develop","slug":"none","local_ref":"securing-your-data","node_id":"prod-readiness-context/data-encryption","node_title":"How

aims to be explicit and differentiate between them.\n\nAn Activity is a normal function or method that executes a single, well-defined action (either short or long running), such as calling another

the execution of Activities, persisting the results.\nIf an Activity Function Execution fails, any future execution starts from initial state (except [Heartbeats](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-heartbeat)).\n\nActivity Functions are executed by Worker Processes.\nWhen the Activity Function returns, the Worker sends the results back to the Temporal Cluster as part of the [ActivityTaskCompleted](/references/events#activitytaskcompleted) Event.\nThe Event is added to the Workflow Execution's Event History.\nFor other Activity-related Events, see [Activity Events](/workflows#activity-events).\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-definition","node":{"file_name":"what-is-an-activity-definition.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-an-activity-definition.md","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-definition","title":"What

Definition","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAn Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an [Activity Task Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution).\n\n- [How to develop an Activity Definition using the Go SDK](/go/how-to-develop-an-activity-definition-in-go)\n- [How to develop an Activity Definition using the Java SDK](/java/developing-activities)\n- [How to develop an Activity Definition using the PHP SDK](/php/developing-activities)\n- [How to develop an Activity Definition using the Python SDK](/python/developing-activities)\n- [How to develop an Activity Definition using the TypeScript SDK](/typescript/developing-activities)\n\nThe term 'Activity Definition' is used to refer to the full set of primitives in any given language SDK that provides an access point to an Activity Function Definition——the method or function that is invoked for an [Activity Task Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution).\nTherefore, the terms Activity Function and Activity Method refer to the source of an instance of an execution.\n\nActivity Definitions are named and referenced in code by their [Activity Type](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-type).\n\n![Activity Definition](/diagrams/activity-definition.svg)\n\n#### Idempotency\n\nTemporal recommends that Activities be idempotent.\n\nAn Activity is idempotent if multiple [Activity Task Executions](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution) do not change the state of the system beyond the first Activity Task Execution.\n\nWe recommend using idempotency keys for critical side effects.\n\nThe lack of idempotency might affect the correctness of your application but does not affect the Temporal Platform.\nIn other words, lack of idempotency does not lead to a platform error.\n\nIn some cases, whether something is idempotent does not affect the correctness of an application.\nFor example, if you have a monotonically incrementing counter, you might not care that retries increment the counter because you don’t care about the actual value, only that the current value is greater than a previous value.\n\n#### Constraints\n\nActivity Definitions are executed as normal functions.\n\nIn the event of failure, the function begins at its initial state when retried (except when Activity Heartbeats are established).\n\nTherefore, an Activity Definition has no restrictions on the code it contains.\n\n#### Parameters\n\nAn Activity Definition can support as many parameters as needed.\n\nAll values passed through these parameters are recorded in the [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history) of the Workflow Execution.\nReturn values are also captured in the Event History for the calling Workflow Execution.\n\nActivity Definitions must contain the following parameters:\n\n- Context: an optional parameter that provides Activity context within multiple APIs.\n- Heartbeat: a notification from the Worker to the Temporal Cluster that the Activity Execution is progressing. Cancelations are allowed only if the Activity Definition permits Heartbeating.\n- Timeouts: intervals that control the execution and retrying of Activity Task Executions.\n\nOther parameters, such as [Retry Policies](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy) and return values, can be seen in the implementation guides, listed in the next section.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-type","node":{"file_name":"what-is-an-activity-type.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-an-activity-type.md","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-type","title":"What is an Activity Type?","description":"An Activity Type is the mapping of a name to an Activity Definition.","label":"Activity Type","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAn Activity Type is the mapping of a name to an Activity Definition.\n\nActivity Types are scoped through Task Queues.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution","node":{"file_name":"what-is-an-activity-execution.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution.md","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution","title":"What is an Activity Execution?","description":"An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.","label":"Activity Execution","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAn Activity Execution is the full chain of [Activity Task Executions](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution).\n\n- [How to start an Activity Execution using the Go SDK](/go/spawning-activities)\n- [How to start an Activity Execution using the Java SDK](/java/spawning-activities)\n- [How to start an Activity Execution using the PHP SDK](/php/spawning-activities)\n- [How to start an Activity Execution using the Python SDK](/python/spawning-activities)\n- [How to start an Activity Execution using the TypeScript SDK](/typescript/spawning-activities)\n\n![Activity Execution](/diagrams/activity-execution.svg)\n\nBy default, an Activity Execution has no time limit.\nYou can customize [Activity Execution timeouts](/concepts/what-is-a-start-to-close-timeout) and [retry policies](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy).\n\nIf an Activity Execution fails (because it exhausted all retries, threw a [non-retryable error](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy#non-retryable-errors), or was canceled), the error is returned to the [Workflow](/workflows), which decides how to handle it.\n\n### Cancellation\n\nActivity Cancellation:\n\n- lets the Activity know it doesn't need to keep doing work, and\n- gives the Activity time to clean up any resources it has created.\n\nActivities can only receive Cancellation if they emit Heartbeats or in Core-based SDKs (TypeScript/Python) are Local Activities (which don't heartbeat but receive Cancellation anyway).\n\nAn Activity may receive Cancellation if:\n\n- The Activity was requested to be Cancelled. This can often cascade from Workflow Cancellation, but not always—SDKs have ways to stop Cancellation from cascading. <!-- TODO link to workflow cancellation -->\n- The Activity was considered failed by the Server because any of the Activity timeouts have triggered (for example, the Server didn't receive a heartbeat within the Activity's Heartbeat timeout). The [Cancelled Failure](/kb/failures#cancelled-failure) that the Activity receives will have `message: 'TIMED_OUT'`.\n- The Workflow Run reached a [Closed state](/workflows#status), in which case the Cancelled Failure will have `message: 'NOT_FOUND'`.\n- In some SDKs:\n  - The Worker is shutting down.\n  - An Activity sends a Heartbeat but the Heartbeat details can't be converted by the Worker's configured [Data Converter](/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter). This fails the Activity Task Execution with an Application Failure.\n\nThere are different ways to receive Cancellation depending on the SDK. <!-- TODO link to dev guide -->\nAn Activity may accept or ignore Cancellation:\n\n- To allow Cancellation to happen, let the Cancellation Failure propagate.\n- To ignore Cancellation, catch it and continue executing.\n\nSome SDKs have ways to shield tasks from being stopped while still letting the Cancellation propagate.\n\nThe Workflow can also decide if it wants to wait for the Activity Cancellation to be accepted or to proceed without waiting.\n\nCancellation can only be requested a single time.\nIf you try to cancel your Activity Execution more than once, it will not receive more than one Cancellation request.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-id","node":{"file_name":"what-is-an-activity-id.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-an-activity-id.md","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-id","title":"What is an Activity Id?","description":"A unique identifier for an Activity Execution.","label":"Activity Id","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nThe identifier for an [Activity Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution).\nThe identifier can be generated by the system, or it can be provided by the Workflow code that spawns the Activity Execution.\nThe identifier is unique among the open Activity Executions of a [Workflow Run](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id).\n(A single Workflow Run may reuse an Activity Id if an earlier Activity Execution with the same Id has closed.)\n\nAn Activity Id can be used to [complete the Activity asynchronously](/concepts/what-is-asynchronous-activity-completion).\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-a-schedule-to-start-timeout","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-schedule-to-start-timeout.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-schedule-to-start-timeout.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-schedule-to-start-timeout","title":"What is a Schedule-To-Start Timeout?","description":"A Schedule-To-Start Timeout is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an Activity Task is placed in a Task Queue to when a Worker picks it up from the Task Queue.","label":"Schedule-To-Start Timeout","tags":["term","explanation","timeouts"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Schedule-To-Start Timeout is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task) is scheduled (that is, placed in a Task Queue) to when a [Worker](/concepts/what-is-a-worker) starts (that is, picks up from the Task Queue) that Activity Task.\nIn other words, it's a limit for how long an Activity Task can be enqueued.\n\n- [How to set a Schedule-To-Start Timeout using the Go SDK](/go/activity-timeouts)\n- [How to set a Schedule-To-Start Timeout using the Java SDK](/java/activity-timeouts)\n- [How to set a Schedule-To-Start Timeout using the PHP SDK](/php/activity-timeouts)\n- [How to set a Schedule-To-Start Timeout using the Python SDK](/python/activity-timeouts)\n- [How to set a Schedule-To-Start Timeout using the TypeScript SDK](/typescript/activity-timeouts)\n\nThe moment that the Task is picked by the Worker from the Task Queue is considered to be the start of the Activity Task for the purposes of the Schedule-To-Start Timeout and associated metrics.\nThis definition of \"Start\" avoids issues that a clock difference between the Temporal Cluster and a Worker might create.\n\n![Schedule-To-Start Timeout period](/diagrams/schedule-to-start-timeout.svg)\n\n\"Schedule\" in Schedule-To-Start and Schedule-To-Close have different frequency guarantees.\n\nThe Schedule-To-Start Timeout is enforced for each Activity Task, whereas the Schedule-To-Close Timeout is enforced once per Activity Execution.\nThus, \"Schedule\" in Schedule-To-Start refers to the scheduling moment of _every_ Activity Task in the sequence of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution, while\n\"Schedule\" in Schedule-To-Close refers to the _first_ Activity Task in that sequence.\n\nA [Retry Policy](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy) attached to an Activity Execution retries an Activity Task.\n\n![Start-To-Close Timeout period with retries](/diagrams/schedule-to-start-timeout-with-retry.svg)\n\nThis timeout has two primary use cases:\n\n1.

Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.\nHeartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.\n\n#### Throttling\n\nHeartbeats may not always be sent to the Cluster—they may be throttled by the Worker.\nThe throttle interval is the smaller of the following:\n\n- If `heartbeatTimeout` is provided, `heartbeatTimeout * 0.8`; otherwise, `defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval`\n- `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval`\n\n`defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval` is 30 seconds by default, and `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval` is 60 seconds by default.\nEach can be set in Worker options.\n\nThrottling is implemented as follows:\n\n- After sending a Heartbeat, the Worker sets a timer for the throttle interval.\n- The Worker stops sending Heartbeats, but continues receiving Heartbeats from the Activity and remembers the most recent one.\n- When the timer fires, the Worker:\n  - Sends the most recent Heartbeat.\n  - Sets the timer again.\n\n#### Which Activities should Heartbeat?\n\nHeartbeating is best thought about not in terms of time, but in terms of \"How do you know you are making progress?\"\nFor short-term operations, progress updates are not a requirement.\nHowever, checking the progress and status of Activity Executions that run over long periods is almost always useful.\n\nConsider the following when setting Activity Hearbeats:\n\n- Your underlying task must be able to report definite progress.\n  Note that your Workflow cannot read this progress information while the Activity is still executing (or it would have to store it in Event History).\n  You can report progress to external sources if you need it exposed to the user.\n\n- Your Activity Execution is long-running, and you need to verify whether the Worker that is processing your Activity is still alive and has not run out of memory or silently crashed.\n\nFor example, the following scenarios are suitable for Heartbeating:\n\n- Reading a large file from Amazon S3.\n- Running a ML training job on some local GPUs.\n\nAnd the following scenarios are not suitable for Heartbeating:\n\n- Making a quick API call.\n- Reading a small file from disk.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout","title":"What

[Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) that spawns it.\n\nSome Activity Executions are very short-living and do not need the queuing semantic, flow control, rate limiting, and routing capabilities.\nFor this case, Temporal supports the Local Activity feature.\n\nThe main benefit of Local Activities is that they use less Temporal Cluster resources (for example, fewer History events) and have much lower latency overhead (because no need to roundtrip to the Cluster) compared to normal Activity Executions.\nHowever, Local Activities are subject to shorter durations and a lack of rate limiting.\n\nConsider using Local Activities for functions that are the following:\n\n- can be implemented in the same binary as the Workflow that calls them.\n- do not require global rate limiting.\n- do not require routing to a specific Worker or Worker pool.\n- no longer than a few seconds, inclusive of retries.\n\nIf it takes longer than 80% of the Workflow Task Timeout (which is 10 seconds by default), the Worker will ask the Cluster to create a new Workflow Task to extend the \"lease\" for processing the Local Activity.\nThe Worker will continue doing so until the Local Activity has completed.\nThis is called Workflow Task Heartbeating.\nThe drawbacks of long-running Local Activities are:\n\n- Each new Workflow Task results in 3 more Events in History.\n- The Workflow won't get notified of new events like Signals and completions until the next Workflow Task Heartbeat.\n- New Commands created by the Workflow concurrently with the Local Activity will not be sent to the Cluster until either the Local Activity completes or the next Workflow Task Heartbeat.\n\nUsing a Local Activity without understanding its limitations can cause various production issues.\n**We recommend using regular Activities unless your use case requires very high throughput and large Activity fan outs of very short-lived Activities.**\nMore guidance in choosing between

measured.\n\nEach History Shard maps to a single persistence partition.\nA History Shard assumes that only one concurrent operation can be within a partition at a time.\nIn essence, the number of History Shards represents the number of concurrent database operations that can occur for a Cluster.\nThis means that the number of History Shards in a Temporal Cluster plays a significant role in the performance of your Temporal Application.\n\nBefore integrating a database, the total number of History Shards for the Temporal Cluster must be chosen and set in the Cluster's configuration (see [persistence](/references/configuration#persistence)).\nAfter the Shard count is configured and the database integrated, the total number of History Shards for the Cluster cannot be changed.\n\nIn theory, a Temporal Cluster can operate with an unlimited number of History Shards, but each History Shard adds compute overhead to the Cluster.\nTemporal Clusters have operated successfully using anywhere from 1 to 128K History Shards, with each Shard responsible for tens of thousands of Workflow Executions.\nOne Shard is useful only in small scale setups designed for testing, while 128k Shards is useful only in very large scale production environments.\nThe correct number of History Shards for any given Cluster depends entirely on the Temporal Application that it is supporting and the type of database.\n\nA History Shard is represented as a hashed integer.\nEach Workflow Execution is automatically assigned to a History Shard.\nThe assignment algorithm hashes Workflow Execution metadata such as Workflow Id and Namespace and uses that value to match a History Shard.\n\nEach History Shard maintains the Workflow Execution Event History, Workflow Execution mutable state, and the following internal Task Queues:\n\n- Internal Transfer Task Queue: Transfers internal tasks to the Matching Service.\n  Whenever a new Workflow Task needs to be scheduled, the History Service's

<https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/config>.\n\n### Dynamic configuration\n\nDynamic configuration contains configuration keys that you can update in your Cluster setup without having to restart the server processes.\n\nAll dynamic configuration keys provided by Temporal have default values that are used by the Cluster.\nYou can override the default values by setting different values for the keys in a YAML file and setting the [dynamic configuration client](/references/configuration#dynamicconfigclient) to poll this file for updates.\nSetting dynamic configuration for your Cluster is optional.\n\nSetting overrides for some configuration keys updates the Cluster configuration immediately.\nHowever, for configuration fields that are checked at startup (such as thread pool

processes and a Cluster.\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, configure mTLS in the `tls` section of the [Cluster configuration](/references/configuration#tls).\nmTLS configuration is a [static

[`WithConfigLoader`](/references/server-options#withconfigloader) server option to start your Temporal Cluster with this configuration.\n\nThe mTLS configuration includes two sections that serve to separate communication within a Temporal Cluster and client calls made from your application to the Cluster.\n\n- `internode`: configuration for encrypting communication between nodes within the Cluster.\n- `frontend`: configuration for encrypting the public endpoints of the Frontend Service.\n\nSetting mTLS for `internode` and `frontend` separately lets you use different certificates and settings to encrypt each section of traffic.\n\n#### Using certificates for Client connections\n\nUse CA certificates to authenticate client connections to your Temporal Cluster.\n\nOn Temporal Cloud, you can [set your CA certificates in your Temporal Cloud settings](/cloud/how-to-manage-certificates-in-temporal-cloud) and use the end-entity certificates in your client calls.\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you can restrict access to Temporal Cluster endpoints by using the `clientCAFiles` or `clientCAData` property and the [`requireClientAuth`](/references/configuration#tls) property in your Cluster configuration.\nThese properties can be specified in both the `internode` and `frontend` sections of the [mTLS configuration](/references/configuration#tls).\nFor details, see the [tls configuration reference](/references/configuration#tls).\n\n#### Server name specification\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you can specify `serverName` in the `client` section of your mTLS configuration to prevent spoofing and [MITM attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).\n\nEntering a value for `serverName` enables established connections to authenticate the endpoint.\nThis ensures that the server certificate presented to any connected client has the specified server name in its CN property.\n\nThis measure can be used for `internode` and `frontend` endpoints.\n\nFor more information on mTLS configuration, see [tls configuration reference](/references/configuration#tls).\n\n#### Authentication and authorization\n\n<!-- commenting this very generic explanation out. Can include it back in if everyone feels strongly.\n **Authentication** is the process of verifying users who want to access your application are actually the users you want accessing it.\n**Authorization** is the verification of applications and data that a user on your Cluster or application has access to. -->\n\nTemporal provides authentication interfaces that can be set to restrict access to your data.\nThese protocols address three areas: servers, client connections, and users.\n\nTemporal offers two plugin interfaces for authentication and authorization of API calls.\n\n- [`ClaimMapper`](/concepts/what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin)\n- [`Authorizer`](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin)\n\nThe logic of both plugins can be customized to fit a variety of use cases.\nWhen plugins are provided, the Frontend Service invokes their implementation before running the requested operation.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-cluster-obervability","node":{"file_name":"what-is-cluster-observability.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-cluster-observability.md","id":"concepts/what-is-cluster-obervability","title":"What

Executions from active Clusters to other passive Clusters, for backup and state reconstruction.\nWhen necessary, for higher availability, Cluster operators can failover to any of the backup Clusters.\n\nTemporal's Multi-Cluster Replication feature is considered **experimental** and not subject to normal [versioning and support policy](/clusters).\n\nTemporal automatically forwards Start, Signal, and Query requests to the active Cluster.\nThis feature must be enabled through a Dynamic Config flag per [Global Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-global-namespace).\n\nWhen the feature is enabled, Tasks are sent to the Parent Task Queue partition that matches that Namespace, if it exists.\n\nAll Visibility APIs can be used against active and standby Clusters.\nThis enables [Temporal UI](https://docs.temporal.io/web-ui) to work seamlessly for Global Namespaces.\nApplications making API calls directly to the Temporal Visibility API continue to work even if a Global Namespace is in standby mode.\nHowever, they might see a lag due to replication delay when querying the Workflow Execution state from a standby Cluster.\n\n#### Namespace Versions\n\nA _version_ is a concept in Multi-Cluster Replication that describes the chronological order of events per Namespace.\n\nWith Multi-Cluster Replication, all Namespace change events and Workflow Execution History events are replicated asynchronously for high throughput.\nThis means that data across clusters is **not** strongly consistent.\nTo guarantee that Namespace data and Workflow Execution data will achieve eventual consistency (especially when there is a data conflict during a failover), a **version** is introduced and attached to Namespaces.\nAll Workflow Execution History entries generated in a Namespace will also come with the version attached to that Namespace.\n\nAll participating Clusters are pre-configured with a unique initial version and a shared version increment:\n\n- `initial version < shared version increment`\n\nWhen performing failover for a Namespace from one Cluster to another Cluster, the version attached to the Namespace will be changed by the following rule:\n\n- for all versions which follow `version % (shared version increment) == (active cluster's initial version)`, find the smallest version which has `version >= old version in namespace`\n\nWhen there is a data conflict, a comparison will be made and Workflow Execution History entries with the highest version will be considered the source of truth.\n\nWhen a cluster is trying to mutate a Workflow Execution History, the version will be checked.\nA cluster can mutate a Workflow Execution History only if the following is true:\n\n- The version in the Namespace belongs to this cluster, i.e.\n  `(version in namespace) % (shared version increment) == (this cluster's initial version)`\n- The version of this Workflow Execution History's last entry (event) is equal or less than the version in the Namespace, i.e.\n  `(last event's version) <= (version in namespace)`\n\n<details>\n<summary>Namespace version change example\n</summary>\n\nAssuming the following scenario:\n\n- Cluster A comes with initial version: 1\n- Cluster B comes with initial version: 2\n- Shared version increment: 10\n\nT = 0: Namespace α is registered, with active Cluster set to Cluster A\n\n```\nnamespace α's version is 1\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 1\n```\n\nT = 1: namespace β is registered, with active Cluster set to Cluster B\n\n```\nnamespace β's version is 2\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 2\n```\n\nT = 2: Namespace α is updated to with active Cluster set to Cluster B\n\n```\nnamespace α's version is 2\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 2\n```\n\nT = 3: Namespace β is updated to with active Cluster set to Cluster A\n\n```\nnamespace β's version is 11\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 11\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### Version history\n\nVersion history is a concept which provides a high level summary of version information in regards to Workflow Execution History.\n\nWhenever there is a new Workflow Execution History entry generated, the version from Namespace will be attached.\nThe Workflow Executions's mutable state will keep track of all history entries (events) and the corresponding version.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Version history example (without data conflict)\n</summary>\n\n- Cluster A comes with initial version: 1\n- Cluster B comes with initial version: 2\n- Shared version increment: 10\n\nT = 0: adding event with event ID == 1 & version == 1\n\nView in both Cluster A & B\n\n```\n| -------- | ------------- |

in Cluster C, same as above\n\n</details>\n\n#### Conflict resolution\n\nWhen a Workflow Execution History diverges, proper conflict resolution is applied.\n\nIn Multi-cluster Replication, Workflow Execution History Events are modeled as a tree, as shown in the second example in [Version History](#version-history).\n\nWorkflow Execution Histories that diverge will have more than one history branch.\nAmong all history branches, the history branch with the highest version is considered the `current branch` and the Workflow Execution's mutable state is a summary of the current branch.\nWhenever there is a switch between Workflow Execution History branches, a complete rebuild of the Workflow Execution's mutable state will occur.\n\nTemporal Multi-Cluster Replication relies on asynchronous replication of Events across Clusters, so in the case of a failover it is possible to have an Activity Task dispatched again to the newly active Cluster due to a replication task lag.\nThis also means that whenever a Workflow Execution is updated after a failover by the new Cluster, any previous replication tasks for that Execution cannot be applied.\nThis results in loss of some progress made by the Workflow Execution in the previous active Cluster.\nDuring such conflict resolution, Temporal re-injects any external Events like Signals in the new Event History before discarding replication tasks.\nEven though some progress could roll back during failovers, Temporal provides the guarantee that Workflow Executions won’t get stuck and will continue to make forward progress.\n\nActivity Execution completions are not forwarded across Clusters.\nAny outstanding Activities will eventually time out based on the configuration.\nYour application should have retry logic in place so that the Activity gets retried and dispatched again to a Worker after the failover to the new Cluster.\nHandling this is similar to handling an Activity Task timeout caused by a Worker restarting.\n\n#### Zombie Workflows\n\nThere is an existing contract that for any Namespace and Workflow Id combination, there can be at most one run (Namespace + Workflow Id + Run Id) open / executing.\n\nMulti-cluster Replication aims to keep the Workflow Execution History as up-to-date as possible among all participating Clusters.\n\nDue to the nature of Multi-cluster Replication (for example, Workflow Execution History events are replicated asynchronously) different Runs (same Namespace and Workflow Id) can arrive at the target Cluster at different times, sometimes out of order, as shown below:\n\n```\n| ------------- |          | ------------- |          | ------------- |\n| Cluster A |  | Network Layer |  | Cluster B |\n| --------- || ------------- |          |

|\n| Cluster A |  | Network Layer |  | Cluster B |\n| --------- || ------------- |          | ------------- |\n```\n\nBecause Run 2 appears in Cluster B first, Run 1 cannot be replicated as \"runnable\" due to the rule `at most one Run open` (see above), thus the \"zombie\" Workflow Execution state is introduced.\nA \"zombie\" state is one in which a Workflow Execution which cannot be actively mutated by a Cluster (assuming the corresponding Namespace is active in this Cluster). A zombie Workflow Execution can only be changed by a replication Task.\n\nRun 1 will be replicated similar to Run 2, except when Run 1's execution will become a \"zombie\" before Run 1 reaches completion.\n\n#### Workflow Task processing\n\nIn the context of Multi-cluster Replication, a Workflow Execution's mutable state is an entity which tracks all pending tasks.\nPrior to the introduction of Multi-cluster Replication, Workflow Execution History entries (events) are from a single branch, and the Temporal Server will only append new entries (events) to the Workflow Execution History.\n\nAfter the introduction of Multi-cluster Replication, it is possible that a Workflow Execution can have multiple Workflow Execution History branches.\nTasks generated according to one history branch may become invalidated by switching history branches during conflict resolution.\n\nExample:\n\nT = 0: task A is generated according to Event Id: 4, version: 2\n\n```\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| Events   |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| Event ID | Event Version |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| 1        | 1             |\n| 2        | 1             |\n| 3        | 2             |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n|          |\n|          |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| Event ID | Event Version |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| 4        | 2             | <-- task A belongs to this event |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n```\n\nT = 1: conflict resolution happens, Workflow Execution's mutable state is rebuilt and history Event Id: 4, version: 3 is written down to persistence\n\n```\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| Events        |\n| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Event ID      | Event Version                                |\n| --------      | -------------                                |\n| 1             | 1                                            |\n| 2             | 1                                            |\n| 3             | 2                                            |\n| --------      | -------------                                |\n|               |\n| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n|               |\n| --------      | -------------                                |                                  | -------- | ------------- |\n| Event ID      | Event Version                                |                                  | Event ID | Event Version |\n| --------      | -------------                                |                                  | -------- | ------------- |\n| 4             | 2                                            | <-- task A belongs to this event | 4        | 3             | <-- current branch / mutable state |\n| --------      | -------------                                |                                  | -------- | ------------- |\n```\n\nT = 2: task A is loaded.\n\nAt this time, due to the rebuild of a Workflow Execution's mutable state (conflict resolution), Task A is no longer relevant (Task A's corresponding Event belongs to non-current branch).\nTask processing logic will verify both the Event Id and version of the Task against a corresponding Workflow Execution's mutable state, then discard task A.\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"concepts","guide_id":"clusters","slug":"/clusters","local_ref":"","node_id":"concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster","node_title":"What is a Temporal Cluster?","node_description":"A Temporal Cluster is a Temporal Server paired with Persistence and Visibility stores."},{"file_dir":"concepts","guide_id":"clusters","slug":"/clusters","local_ref":"temporal-server","node_id":"concepts/what-is-the-temporal-server","node_title":"What is the Temporal Server?","node_description":"The Temporal Server is a grouping of four horizontally scalable services."},{"file_dir":"concepts","guide_id":"clusters","slug":"/clusters","local_ref":"frontend-service","node_id":"concepts/what-is-a-frontend-service","node_title":"What is a Frontend Service?","node_description":"The Frontend Service is a stateless gateway service that exposes a strongly typed Proto API.

payloads on the Temporal Server (whether on Temporal Cloud or a self-hosted Temporal Cluster) remain encrypted.\n\nBecause you create, operate, and manage access to your Codec Server in your controlled environment, ensure that you consider the following:\n\n- When you set your codec endpoint with your Web UI, expect your Codec Server to receive a large number of requests per Workflow Execution from the Web UI.\n- Ensure that you secure access your Codec Server.\n  For details, see [Authorization](#authorization).\n- The Temporal Web UI only displays the decoded payloads received from your Codec Server in real-time; it does not store or send the data back to the Temporal Server (whether on Cloud or self-hosted Temporal Cluster).\n- You might have latencies introduced in the Web UI when sending and receiving payloads to the Codec Server.\n\nTo create a Codec Server, you need the following components:\n\n- A [Payload Codec](/concepts/what-is-a-payload-codec) with the requisite keys and logic to decode your encrypted payloads.\n  You can use the Payload Codec that you applied with your Data Converter to encode your Payloads and configure it with your Codec Server.\n  However, if you are writing your Codec Server in a different SDK from the one that applies the Data Converter, ensure that your logic and keys are correctly replicated.\n- Key management infrastructure or plan for sharing your encryption keys between the Workers and your Codec Server.\n- [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) configuration on the HTTP/HTTPS endpoints in your Codec Server for sending and receiving requests from the Temporal Web UI.\n- Optional: Secure access through VPN and access control.\n  For details, see [Authorization](#authorization).\n\nFor examples on how to create your Codec Server, see following Codec Server implementation samples:\n\n- [Go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server)\n- [Java](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/tree/master/temporal-remote-data-encoder)\n- [Python](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/blob/main/encryption/codec_server.py)\n- [TypeScript](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/encryption/src/codec-server.ts)\n\n### API contract specifications\n\nWhen you create your Codec Server to handle requests from the Web UI, the following requirements must be met.\n\n#### Endpoints\n\nThe [Web UI/CLI calls the POST method with the /decode endpoint](https://github.com/temporalio/ui/blob/11ef7ddb47711444a365c7760eae41853446da07/src/lib/services/data-encoder.ts#L38).\n\nIn your Codec Server, create a `/decode` path and pass the incoming payload to the decode method in your Payload Codec.\n\nYou can also add a [verification step](#authorization) to check whether the incoming request has the required authorization to access the decode logic in your Payload Codec.\n\n#### Headers\n\nEach request from the Web UI to your Codec Server includes the following headers:\n\n- `Content-Type: application/json`: Ensure that your Codec Server can accommodate this [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types).\n\n- `X-Namespace: {namespace}`: This is a custom HTTP Header. Ensure that the [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) configuration in your Codec Server includes this header.\n\n- [Optional] `Authorization: <credentials>`: Include this in your CORS configuration when enabling authorization with your Codec Server.\n\nFor details on setting up authorization, see [Authorization](#authorization).\n\n#### Request body\n\nThe general specification for the `POST` request body contains payloads.\nBy default, all field values in your payload are base64 encoded, regardless of whether they are encrypted by your custom codec implementation.\n\nThe following example shows a sample `POST` request body with base64 encoding.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"payloads\": [{\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"encoding\": <base64EncodedEncodingHint>\n    },\n    \"data\": <encryptedPayloadData>\n  }, ...]\n}\n```\n\n#### CORS\n\nEnable [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) requests on your Codec Server to receive HTTP/HTTPS requests from the Temporal Web UI.\n\nAt a minimum, enable the following responses from your Codec Server to allow requests coming from the Temporal Web UI:\n\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`\n\nFor example, for Temporal Cloud Web UI hosted at https://cloud.temporal.io, enable the following in your Codec Server:\n\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://cloud.temporal.io`\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS`\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Namespace, Content-Type`\n\nFor details on what a sample request/response looks like from the Temporal Web UI, see [Sample Request/Response](#sample-requestresponse).\nIf setting authorization, include `Authorization` in your `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.\nFor details on setting up authorization, see [Authorization](#authorization).\n\n#### Authorization\n\nTo enable authorization from the Web UI (for both self-hosted Cluster and Temporal Cloud), your Codec Server must be an HTTPS Server.\n\n**Temporal Cloud**\n\nThe Temporal Cloud UI provides an option to pass access tokens (JWT) to your Codec Server endpoints.\nUse the access tokens to validate access and then return decoded payloads from the Codec Server.\n\nYou can enable this by selecting **Pass access token** in your Codec Server endpoint interface where you add your endpoint.\nEnabling this option in the Temporal Cloud UI adds an authorization header to each request sent to the Codec Server endpoint that you set.\n\nIn your Codec Server implementation, verify the signature on this access token (in your authorization header) against the JWKS endpoint provided to you.\n\n<!--Update: the JWKS link is provided in the UI onboarding content for now.\nIs this process defined? when a customer signs up for temporal cloud, do we provide them with the JWKS as part of the onboarding process? also the JWKS endpoint is rate-limited - something we should call out when providing the link to users.-->\n\n<!-- Commenting this for now.-->\n<!--If you want to unpack the claims in your token to add additional checks on whether the user has valid access to the Namespace and payloads they are trying to access, you can implement it using Auth0 SDKs, middleware, or one of the third-party libraries at JWT.io.-->\n\nThe token provided from Temporal Cloud UI contains the email identifier of the person requesting access to the payloads.\nBased on the permissions you have provided to the user in your access control systems, set conditions in your Codec Server whether to return decoded payloads or just return the original encoded payloads.\n\n**Self-hosted Temporal Cluster**\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, configure [authorization in the Web UI configuration](/references/web-ui-configuration#auth) in your Temporal Cluster setup.\n\nWith this enabled, you can pass access tokens to your Codec Server and validate the requests from the Web UI to the Codec Server endpoints that you set.\n\nNote that with self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you must explicitly configure authorization specifications for the Web UI and CLI.\n\nThe following sample provides implementation examples for applying authentication on your Codec Server using the Go SDK.\n\n- [Codec Server](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server)\n\n#### Sample request/response\n\nConsider the following sample request/response when creating and hosting a Codec Server with the following specifications:\n\n- Scheme: `https`\n- Host: `dev.mydomain.com/codec`\n- Path: `/decode`\n\n```json\nHTTP/1.1 POST /decode\nHost: https://dev.mydomain.com/codec\nContent-Type: application/json\nX-Namespace: myapp-dev.acctid123\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n\n{\"payloads\":[{\"metadata\":{\"encoding\":\"anNvbi9wcm90b2J1Zg==\",\"messageType\":\"dGVtcG9yYWxfc2hvcC5vcmNoZXN0cmF0aW9ucy52MS5TdGFydFNob3BwaW5nQ2FydFJlcXVlc3Q=\"},\"data\":\"eyJjYXJ0SWQiOiJleGFtcGxlLWNhcnQiLCJzaG9wcGVySWQiOiJ5b3VyLXNob3BwZXItaWQtZXhhbXBsZSIsImVtYWlsIjoieW91ci1lbWFpbEBkb21haW4uY29tIn0\"}]}\n\n200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"payloads\": [{\n    \"metadata\":{\n      \"encoding\": \"json/protobuf\",\n      \"messageType\": \"temporal_shop.orchestrations.v1.StartShoppingCartRequest\"\n    },\n    \"data\":{\n      \"cartId\":\"example-cart\",\n      \"shopperId\":\"your-shopper-id-example\",\n      \"email\":\"your-email@domain.com\"\n    }}]\n}\n```\n\n### Hosting your Codec Server\n\nYour Codec Server can be hosted at an organization level or locally.\n\n#### Organization-level hosting\n\nHosting the Codec Server for your organization simplifies both key management used for decryption and versioning the codec itself.\nConsider the following details for a multi-tenant approach to setting up your Codec Server:\n\n- Ingress: Your server will require ingress configuration for your users to access the server.\n- Authorization: You must set explicit authorization checks to validate requests to your Codec Server.\n\n#### Local hosting\n\nLocally hosting the Codec Server is simpler to get started.\nHowever, consider the following before choosing to do so:\n\n- A single URL configuration is accepted for the Cloud account.\n  This means some agreed-upon policy on the URL must be made for everyone using the Namespaces in this account.\n  For example, if you configure your remote codec endpoint to be http://localhost:8080/codec, every developer must host your Codec Server locally at that port.\n\n  Alternatively, you can use the local `hosts` file to allow each developer to choose where to host.\n  For example, configure the remote codec endpoint as http://codec.server and allow each developer to control what it maps to locally.\n\n- Distributing encryption keys that can decrypt the payloads at your organization can be a security risk.\n\n### Set your Codec Server endpoints with Web UI and CLI\n\nAfter you create your Codec Server and expose the requisite endpoints, set the endpoints in your Web UI and CLI.\n\n#### Web UI\n\nOn Temporal Cloud and self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you can configure a Codec Server endpoint to be used for a Namespace in the Web UI.\n\n![Codec Server endpoint Namespace setting](/img/set-codec-endpoint-form.png)\n\nTo set a Codec Server endpoint on a Namespace, do the following.\n\n1. In the Web UI, go to Namespaces, select the Namespace where you want to configure the Codec Server endpoint, and click **Edit**.\n1. In the **Codec Server** section on the Namespace configuration page, enter your Codec Server endpoint and port number.\n1. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [authenticate requests](#authorization) from Temporal Web UI, enable **Pass access token** to send a JWT access token with the HTTPS requests.\n1. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [verify origins of requests](#cors), enable **Include cross-origin credentials**.\n\nSetting a Codec Server endpoint on a Namespace enables it for all users on the Namespace.\nOn Temporal Cloud, you must have [Namespace Admin privileges](/cloud/#namespace-level-permissions) to add a Codec Server endpoint on the Namespace.\n\nAll users on a Namespace have the option to override the Namespace-level setting at the browser level.\nOverriding the Namespace-level endpoint only affects your browser.\nThis can be useful when developing, testing, or troubleshooting encoding functionality.\n\n![Codec Server endpoint browser setting](/img/data-encoder-button.png)\n\nTo set a browser override for the Namespace-level endpoint, do the following.\n\n1. Navigate to **Workflows** in your Namespace.\n2. In the top-right corner, select **Configure Codec Server**.\n3. Select whether you want to use the Namespace-level (or Cluster-level for self-hosted Cluster) or the browser-level Codec Endpoint setting as the default for your browser.\n   In Temporal Cloud:\n   - **Use Namespace-level settings, where available. Otherwise, use my browser setting.**\n     Uses the Namespace-level Codec Server endpoint by default.\n     If no endpoint is set on the Namespace, your browser setting is applied.\n   - **Use my browser setting and ignore Namespace-level setting.**\n     Applies your browser-level setting by default, overriding the Namespace-level Codec Server endpoint.\n4. Enter your Codec Server endpoint and port number.\n5. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [authenticate requests](#authorization) from Temporal Web UI, enable **Pass access token** to send a JWT access token with the HTTPS requests.\n6. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [verify origins of requests](#cors), enable **Include cross-origin credentials**.\n\nIn self-hosted Temporal Clusters where you set up your UI Server, you can also set the codec endpoint in the UI server [configuration file](/references/web-ui-configuration#codec), as shown in the following example.\n\n```yaml\ncodec:\n    endpoint: {{ default .Env.TEMPORAL_CODEC_ENDPOINT \"{namespace}\"}}\n```\n\nStart the UI server to use this endpoint on the Web UI for decoding data in Workflow Executions in the specified Namespace.\n\n#### CLI\n\nIn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, after the Codec Server is started, provide the exposed endpoint to CLI using the `--codec_endpoint` command option.\n\nFor example, if you are running your Codec Server locally and expose port 8888 as your endpoint, run the following command to set the codec endpoint globally.\n\n```bash\ntemporal env set --codec-endpoint \"http://localhost:8888\"\n```\n\nIf your codec endpoint is not set globally, use the `--codec-endpoint` option with your CLI commands.\nFor example, to see the decoded output of the Workflow Execution \"yourWorkflow\" in the Namespace \"yourNamespace\", run the following command.\n\n```bash\ntemporal --codec-endpoint \"http://localhost:8888\" --namespace \"yourNamespace\" workflow show --workflow-id \"yourWorkflow\"  --run-id \"<yourRunId>\" --output \"table\"\n```\n\nFor details, see the [CLI reference](/cli/).\n\nCurrently in Temporal Cloud, you can set the Codec Server endpoint only from the Web UI.\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"concepts","guide_id":"dataconversion","slug":"/dataconversion","local_ref":"","node_id":"concepts/what-is-a-data-converter","node_title":"What is

of isolation within the Temporal Platform.\n\nA single Namespace is still multi-tenant.\n\n### Usage\n\nNamespaces are created on the Temporal Cluster, and provide a range of controls to achieve isolation on Workflow Executions.\n\n- Namespaces are a mechanism for resource isolation. Heavy traffic from one Namespace will not impact other Namespaces running on the same Cluster.\n  For example, you can use Namespaces to match the development lifecycle by having separate `dev` and `prod` Namespaces.\n- If no other Namespace is specified, the Temporal Cluster uses the Namespace \"default\" for all Temporal SDKs and tctl.\n  See the [Registration](#registration) section for details.\n- Namespaces created on self-hosted Temporal Clusters are case-sensitive. For example, `foo` and `Foo` are two different Namespaces.\n  On Temporal Cloud, Namespaces are case-insensitive, and we recommend using lowercase for Namespace names to avoid potential issues.\n- **Membership**: [Task Queue](/concepts/what-is-a-task-queue) names and [Workflow Ids](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id) must all correspond to a specific Namespace.\n  For example, when a Workflow Execution is spawned, it does so within a specific Namespace.\n- **Uniqueness**: Temporal guarantees a unique Workflow Id within a Namespace.\n  Workflow Executions may have the same Workflow Id if they are in different Namespaces.\n- **Namespace Configuration**: Various configuration options like the [Retention Period](/concepts/what-is-a-retention-period) and the [Archival](/concepts/what-is-archival) destination are configured per Namespace through a special CRUD API or through [`tctl`](/tctl-v1/namespace).\n\n### Registration\n\nRegistering a Namespace creates the Namespace on the Temporal Cluster.\nWhen you register your Namespace, you must also set the [Retention Period](/concepts/what-is-a-retention-period) for the Namespace.\n\nOn Temporal Cloud, use the [Temporal Cloud UI](/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud) or [tcld commands](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to create and manage Namespaces.\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you can register your Namespaces using tctl (recommended) or programmatically using APIs. Note that these APIs and tctl commands will not work with Temporal Cloud.\n\nAll SDKs require a Namespace on the Temporal Cluster (or Temporal Cloud) for their Client calls. If not set using Client options, the Workflow Client API looks for the `default` Namespace. If there is no default Namespace registered with your Temporal Cluster (or Temporal Cloud), all calls will throw errors.\nYou must register your Namespace with the Temporal Cluster (or Temporal Cloud) before setting it in your Client.\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you can register your Namespaces in the following ways:\n\n- In your Cluster setup, create your Namespaces, including the default, in your setup script.\n  For example:\n\n  - If deploying through Docker Compose or using the [auto-setup image](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-builds/blob/main/docker/auto-setup.sh) in a custom Docker Compose application, the Namespace \"default\" is created, through the auto-setup script.\n  - If deploying through the [Temporal Helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts), you can create the \"default\" Namespace by using tctl; for example, `tctl --namespace default namespace register`.\n\n- Use the `tctl namespace register` command with the `--retention` modfiier to register your Namespaces, one at a time, and set the Retention Period on each.\n\n  - [How to register a new Namespace using tctl](/tctl-v1/namespace#register)\n  - [How to register a new Namespace using the Go SDK](/go/register-namespaces)\n  - [How to register a new Namespace using the Java SDK](/java/register-namespaces)\n\n- In your Client program, register your Namespace using `RegisterNamespaceRequest` API available in all the SDKs.\n\nNote that registering a Namespace takes up to 15 seconds to complete. Ensure that you are waiting for this process to complete before making calls to the Namespace.\n\n### Manage Namespaces\n\nUse a custom [Authorizer](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin) on your Frontend Service in the Temporal Cluster to set restrictions on who can create, update, or deprecate Namespaces.\n\nOn Temporal Cloud, use the [Temporal Cloud UI](/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud) or [tcld commands](/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to manage Namespaces.\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you can manage your registered Namespaces using tctl (recommended) or programmatically using APIs.\nNote that these APIs and tctl commands will not work with Temporal Cloud.\n\n- [How to manage Namespaces using the Go SDK](/go/manage-namespaces)\n- [How to manage Namespaces using the Java SDK](/java/manage-namespaces)\n\n- Update information and configuration for a registered Namespace on your Temporal Cluster:\n\n  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace update`](/tctl-v1/namespace#update)\n  - Use the Update Namespace API to update configuration on a Namespace.\n\n- Get details for a registered Namespace on your Temporal Cluster:\n\n  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace describe`](/tctl-v1/namespace#describe)\n  - Use the Describe Namespace to return information and configuration details for a registered Namespace.\n\n- Get details for all registered Namespaces on your Temporal Cluster:\n\n  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace list`](/tctl-v1/namespace#list)\n  - Use the List Namespace API to return information and configuration details for all registered Namespaces on your Temporal Cluster.\n\n- Deprecate a Namespace: The Deprecate Namespace updates the state of a registered Namespace to \"DEPRECATED\". Once a Namespace is deprecated, you cannot start new Workflow Executions on it. All existing and running Workflow Executions on a deprecated Namespace will continue to run.\n\n- Delete a Namespace: Deletes a Namespace and all Workflow Executions on the Namespace. Note that this API is supported for Temporal Server version 1.17 and later.\n- With tctl: [`tctl namespace delete`](/cli/operator/namespace/delete).\n- Use the DeleteNamespace API to delete a registered Namespaces.

an Activity is designed to handle such issues.\n\n- **Activity Execution**: When an Activity Execution is spawned, it is associated with a default Retry Policy, and thus Activity Task Executions are retried by default.\n  When an Activity Task Execution is retried, the Cluster places a new [Activity Task](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task) into its respective [Activity Task Queue](/concepts/what-is-a-task-queue), which results in a new Activity Task Execution.\n\n## Custom Retry Policy\n\nTo use a custom Retry Policy, provide it as an options parameter when starting a Workflow Execution or Activity Execution.\nOnly certain scenarios merit starting a Workflow Execution with a custom Retry Policy, such as the following:\n\n- A [Temporal Cron Job](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job) or some other stateless, always-running Workflow Execution that can benefit from retries.\n- A file-processing or media-encoding Workflow Execution that downloads files to a host.\n\n## Properties\n\n### Default values for Retry Policy\n\n```\nInitial Interval     = 1 second\nBackoff Coefficient  = 2.0\nMaximum Interval     = 100 × Initial Interval\nMaximum Attempts     = ∞\nNon-Retryable Errors = []\n```\n\n### Initial Interval\n\n- **Description**: Amount of time that must elapse before the first retry occurs.\n  - **The default value is 1 second.**\n- **Use case**: This is used as the base interval time for the [Backoff Coefficient](#backoff-coefficient) to multiply against.\n\n### Backoff Coefficient\n\n- **Description**: The value dictates how much the _retry interval_ increases.\n  - **The default value is 2.0.**\n  - A backoff coefficient of 1.0 means that the retry interval always equals the [Initial Interval](#initial-interval).\n- **Use case**: Use this attribute to increase the interval between retries.\n  By having a backoff coefficient greater than 1.0, the first few retries happen relatively quickly to overcome intermittent failures, but subsequent retries happen farther and farther apart to account for longer outages.\n  Use the [Maximum Interval](#maximum-interval) attribute to prevent the coefficient from increasing the retry interval too much.\n\n### Maximum Interval\n\n- **Description**: Specifies the maximum interval between retries.\n  - **The default value is 100 times the [Initial Interval](#initial-interval).**\n- **Use case**: This attribute is useful for [Backoff Coefficients](#backoff-coefficient) that are greater than 1.0 because it prevents the retry interval from growing infinitely.\n\n### Maximum Attempts\n\n- **Description**: Specifies the maximum number of execution attempts that can be made in the presence of failures.\n  - **The default is unlimited.**\n  - If this limit is exceeded, the execution fails without retrying again. When this happens an error is returned.\n  - Setting the value to 0 also means unlimited.\n  - Setting the value to 1 means a single execution attempt and no retries.\n  - Setting the value to a negative integer results in an error when the execution is invoked.\n- **Use case**: Use this attribute to ensure that retries do not continue indefinitely.\n  However, in the majority of cases, we recommend relying on the Workflow Execution Timeout, in the case of [Workflows](#workflow), or Schedule-To-Close Timeout, in the case of [Activities](#activity), to limit the total duration of retries instead of using this attribute.\n\n### Non-Retryable Errors\n\n- **Description**: Specifies errors that shouldn't be retried.\n  - **Default is none.**\n  - Errors are matched against the `type` field of the [Application Failure](/kb/failures#application-failure).\n  - If one of those errors occurs, a retry does not occur.\n- **Use case**: If you know of errors that should not trigger a retry, you can specify that, if they occur, the execution is not retried.\n\n## Retry interval\n\nThe wait time before a retry is the _retry interval_. A retry interval is the smaller of two values:\n\n- The [Initial Interval](#initial-interval) multiplied by the [Backoff Coefficient](#backoff-coefficient) raised to the power of the number of retries.\n- The [Maximum Interval](#maximum-interval).\n\n## Event History\n\nThere are some subtle nuances to how Events are recorded to an Event History when a Retry Policy comes into play.\n\n- For an Activity Execution, the [ActivityTaskStarted](/concepts/what-is-an-event#activitytaskstarted) Event will not show up in the Workflow Execution Event History until the Activity Execution has completed or failed (having exhausted all retries).\n  This is to avoid filling the Event History with noise.\n  Use the Describe API to get a pending Activity Execution's attempt count.\n\n- For a Workflow Execution with a Retry Policy, if the Workflow Execution fails, the Workflow Execution will [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new) and the associated Event is written to the Event History.\n  The [WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew](/concepts/what-is-an-event#workflowexecutioncontinuedasnew) Event will have an \"initiator\" field that will specify the Retry Policy as the value and the new Run Id for the next retry attempt.\n  The new Workflow Execution is created immediately.\n  But the first Workflow Task won't be scheduled until the backoff duration is exhausted.\n  That duration is recorded as the `firstWorkflowTaskBackoff` field of the new run's `WorkflowExecutionStartedEventAttributes` event.\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"concepts","guide_id":"retry-policies","slug":"/retry-policies","local_ref":"","node_id":"concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy","node_title":"What is

internally mutate state, which can result in breaking determinism.\n\nBy default, Workflows run in a sandbox environment.\nIf a Workflow Execution performs a non-deterministic event, an exception is

Each word in a **Text** is considered a searchable keyword.\n  For a UUID, that can be problematic because Elasticsearch indexes each portion of the UUID separately.\n  To have the whole string considered as a searchable keyword, use the **Keyword** type.\n  For example, if the key `ProductId` has the value of `2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`:\n  - As a **Keyword** it would be matched only by `ProductId = \"2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`.\n  - As a **Text** it would be matched by `ProductId = 2dd8`, which could cause unwanted matches.\n- With Temporal Server v1.19 and earlier, the **Keyword** type can store a list of values.\n- With Temporal Server v1.20 and later, the **Keyword** type supports only a single value.\n  To store a list of values, use **KeywordList**.\n- The **Text** type cannot be used in the \"Order By\" clause.\n\n#### Custom Search Attributes limits\n\n<!-- TODO - [How to configure maximum number of Search Attribute keys per Cluster](#) -->\n\nThe following table lists the maximum number of custom Search Attributes you can create per Namespace by supported Visibility database.\n\n| Search Attribute type | MySQL (v8.0.17 and later) | PostgreSQL (v12 and later) | SQLite (v3.31.0 and later) | Temporal Cloud |\n| --------------------- | :-----------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------: |\n| Bool                  |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |\n| Datetime              |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |\n| Double                |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |\n| Int                   |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |\n| Keyword               |            10             |             10             |             10             |       20       |\n| KeywordList           |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |\n| Text                  |             3             |             3              |             3              |       5        |\n\nTemporal does not impose a limit on the number of custom Search Attributes you can create with Elasticsearch.

Attributes available in your Visibility store can be used with Workflow Executions for that Cluster.\nTo actually have results from the use of a [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter), Search Attributes must be added to a Workflow Execution as metadata.\n\n- To create custom Search Attributes in your Visibility store, see [Create custom Search Attributes](/clusters/how-to-create-custom-search-attribute-keys).\n- To remove a custom Search Attribute from the Visbility store, see [Remove custom Search Attributes](/clusters/how-to-remove-a-custom-search-attribute-key).\n  Removing custom Search Attributes is not supported on Temporal Cloud.\n- To rename a custom Search Attribute on Temporal Cloud, see [`tcld namespace search-attributes rename`](/cloud/tcld/namespace#rename).\n\nWith Workflows you can do the following:\n\n- Set the value of Search Attributes in your Workflow\n- Update the value set for a Search Attribute from within the Workflow code\n- Remove the value set for a Search Attribute from within the Workflow code\n\n- [How to manage Search Attributes using the Go

Execution in a blocked state can be safely removed from a Worker.\nLater on, it can be resurrected on the same or different Worker when the need arises (in the form of an external event).\nTherefore,

executing your code in response to a Task, and responding to the [Temporal Cluster](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster) with the results.\n\nMore formally, a Worker Process is any process that implements the Task Queue Protocol and the Task Execution Protocol.\n\n- A Worker Process is a Workflow Worker Process if the process implements the Workflow Task Queue Protocol and executes the Workflow Task Execution Protocol to make progress on a Workflow Execution.\n  A Workflow Worker Process can listen on an arbitrary number of Workflow Task Queues and can execute an arbitrary number of Workflow Tasks.\n- A Worker Process is an Activity Worker Process if the process implements the Activity Task Queue Protocol and executes the Activity Task Processing Protocol to make progress on an Activity Execution.\n  An Activity Worker Process can listen on an arbitrary number of Activity Task Queues and can execute an arbitrary number of Activity Tasks.\n\n**Worker Processes are external to a Temporal Cluster.**\nTemporal Application developers are responsible for developing [Worker Programs](/concepts/what-is-a-worker-program) and operating Worker Processes.\nSaid another way, the [Temporal Cluster](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster) (including the Temporal Cloud) doesn't execute any of your code (Workflow and Activity Definitions) on Temporal Cluster machines. The Cluster is solely responsible for orchestrating [State Transitions](/concepts/what-is-a-state-transition) and providing Tasks to the next available [Worker Entity](/concepts/what-is-a-worker-entity).\n\nWhile data transferred in Event Histories is [secured by mTLS](/security/#encryption-of-network-traffic), by default, it is still readable at rest in the Temporal Cluster.\n\nTo solve this, Temporal SDKs offer a [Data Converter API](/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter) that you can use to customize the serialization of data going out of and coming back in to a Worker Entity, with the net effect of guaranteeing that the Temporal Cluster cannot read sensitive business data.\n\nIn many of our tutorials, we show you how to run both a Temporal Cluster and one Worker on the same machine for local development.\nHowever, a production-grade Temporal Application typically has a _fleet_ of Worker Processes, all running on hosts external to the Temporal Cluster.\nA Temporal Application can have as many Worker Processes as needed.\n\nA Worker Process can be both a Workflow Worker Process and an Activity Worker Process.\nMany SDKs support the ability to have multiple Worker Entities in a single Worker Process.\n(Worker Entity creation and management differ between SDKs.)\nA single Worker Entity can listen to only a single Task Queue.\nBut if a Worker Process has multiple Worker Entities, the Worker Process could be listening to multiple Task Queues.\n\n![Entity relationship diagram (meta model) of Worker Processes, Task Queues, and Tasks](/diagrams/worker-and-server-entity-relationship.svg)\n\nWorker Processes executing Activity Tasks must have access to any resources needed to execute the actions that are defined in Activity Definitions, such as the following:\n\n- Network access for external API calls.\n- Credentials for infrastructure provisioning.\n- Specialized GPUs for machine learning utilities.\n\nThe Temporal Cluster itself has [internal workers](https://temporal.io/blog/workflow-engine-principles/#system-workflows-1910) for system Workflow Executions.\nHowever, these internal workers are not visible to

poll for [Tasks](/concepts/what-is-a-task).\n\nTask Queues do not have any ordering guarantees.\nIt is possible to have a Task that stays in a Task Queue for a period of time, if there is a backlog that wasn't drained for that time.\n\nThere are two types of Task Queues, Activity Task Queues and Workflow Task Queues.\n\n![Task Queue component](/diagrams/task-queue.svg)\n\nTask Queues are very lightweight components.\nTask Queues do not require explicit registration but instead are created on demand when a Workflow Execution or Activity spawns or when a Worker Process subscribes to it.\nWhen a Task Queue is created, both a Workflow Task Queue and an Activity Task Queue are created under the same name.\nThere is no limit to the number of Task Queues a Temporal Application can use or a Temporal Cluster can maintain.\n\nWorkers poll for Tasks in Task Queues via synchronous RPC.\nThis implementation offers several benefits:\n\n- A Worker Process polls for a message only when it has spare capacity, avoiding overloading itself.\n- In effect, Task Queues enable load balancing across many Worker Processes.\n- Task Queues enable what we call [Task Routing](/concepts/what-is-task-routing), which is the routing of specific Tasks to specific Worker Processes or even a specific process.\n- Task Queues support server-side throttling, which enables you to limit the Task dispatching rate to the pool of Worker Processes while still supporting Task dispatching at higher rates when spikes happen.\n- When all Worker Processes are down, messages simply persist in a Task Queue, waiting for the Worker Processes to recover.\n- Worker Processes do not need to advertise themselves through DNS or any other network discovery mechanism.\n- Worker Processes do not need to have any open ports, which is more secure.\n\nAll Workers listening to a given Task Queue must have identical registrations of Activities and/or Workflows.\nThe one exception is during a Server upgrade, where it is okay to have registration temporarily misaligned while the binary rolls out.\n\n#### Where to set Task Queues\n\nThere are four places where the name of the Task Queue can be set by the developer.\n\n1.

API](/concepts/what-is-a-worker-session) that provides a straightforward way to ensure that Activity Tasks are executed with the same Worker without requiring you to manually specify Task Queue names.\nIt also includes features like concurrent session limitations and worker failure detection.\n\n### Flow control\n\nA Worker that consumes from a Task Queue asks for an Activity Task only when it has available capacity, so it is never overloaded by request spikes.\nIf Activity Tasks get created faster than Workers can process them, they are backlogged in the Task Queue.\n\n### Throttling\n\nThe rate at which each Activity Worker polls for and processes Activity Tasks is configurable per Worker.\nWorkers do not exceed this rate even if it has spare capacity.\nThere is also support for global Task Queue rate limiting.\nThis limit works across all Workers for the given Task Queue.\nIt is frequently used to limit load on a downstream service that an Activity calls into.\n\n### Specific environments\n\nIn some cases, you might need to execute Activities in a dedicated environment.\nTo send Activity Tasks to this environment, use a dedicated Task Queue.\n\n#### Route Activity Tasks to a specific host\n\nIn some use cases, such as file processing or machine learning model training, an Activity Task must be routed to a specific Worker Process or Worker Entity.\n\nFor example, suppose that you have a Workflow with the following three separate Activities:\n\n- Download a file.\n- Process the file in some way.\n- Upload a file to another location.\n\nThe first Activity, to download the file, could occur on any Worker on any host.\nHowever, the second and third Activities must be executed by a Worker on the same host where the first Activity downloaded the file.\n\nIn a real-life scenario, you might have many Worker Processes scaled over many hosts.\nYou would need to develop your Temporal Application to route Tasks to specific Worker Processes when needed.\n\nCode samples:\n\n- [Go file processing example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/master/fileprocessing)\n- [Java file processing

process.\nThe Activities that rely on those datasets should be routed to the same process.\n\nIn this case, a unique Task Queue would exist for each Worker Process involved.\n\n#### Workers with different capabilities\n\nSome Workers might exist on GPU boxes versus non-GPU boxes.\nIn this case, each type of box would have its own Task Queue and a Workflow can pick one to send Activity Tasks.\n\n### Multiple priorities\n\nIf your use case involves more than one priority, you can create one Task Queue per priority, with a Worker pool per priority.\n\n### Versioning\n\nTask Routing is

simplifies the process of deploying changes to [Workflow Definitions](/workflows/#workflow-definition).\nIt does this by letting you define sets of versions that are compatible with each other, and then assigning a Build ID to the code that defines a Worker.\nThe Temporal Server uses the Build ID to determine which versions of a Workflow Definition a Worker can process.\n\nWe recommend that you read about Workflow Definitions before proceeding, because Workflow Versioning is largely concerned with helping to manage nondeterministic changes to those definitions.\n\nWorker Versioning helps manage nondeterministic changes by providing a convenient way to ensure that [Workers](#workers) with different Workflow and Activity Definitions operating on the same [Task Queue](#task-queue) don't attempt to process [Workflow Tasks](#workflow-task) and [Activity Tasks](#activity-task-execution) that they can't successfully process, according to sets of versions associated with that Task Queue that you've defined.\n\nAccomplish this goal by assigning a Build ID (a free-form string) to the code that defines a Worker, and specifying which Build IDs are compatible with each other by updating the version sets associated with the Task Queue, stored by the Temporal Server.\n\n### When and why you should use Worker Versioning\n\nThe main reason to use this feature is to deploy incompatible changes to short-lived [Workflows](/workflows).\nOn Task Queues using this feature, the Workflow starter doesn't have to know about the introduction of new versions.\n\nThe new code in the newly deployed Workers executes new [Workflow Executions](#workflow-execution), while only Workers with an appropriate version process old Workflow Executions.\n\n#### Decommission old Workers\n\nYou can decommission old Workers after you archive all open Workflows using their version.\nIf you have no need to query closed Workflows, you can decommission them when no open Workflows remain at that version.\n\nFor example, if you have a Workflow that completes within a day, a good strategy is to assign a new Build ID to every new Worker build and add it as the new overall default in the version sets.\n\nBecause your Workflow completes in a day, you know that you won't need to keep older Workers running for more than a day after you deploy the new version (assuming availability).\n\nRemoving old versions from the sets isn't necessary.\nLeaving them doesn't cause any harm.\n\nYou can apply this technique to longer-lived Workflows too; however, you might need to run multiple Worker versions simultaneously while open Workflows complete.\n\n#### Deploy code changes to Workers\n\nThe feature also lets you implement compatible changes to or prevent a buggy code path from executing on currently open Workflows.\nYou can achieve this by adding a new version to an existing set and defining it as _compatible_ with an existing version, which shouldn't execute any future Workflow Tasks.\nBecause the new version processes existing [Event Histories](/workflows/#event-history), it must adhere to the usual [deterministic constraints](/workflows/#deterministic-constraints), and you might need to use one of the [versioning APIs](/workflows/#workflow-versioning).\n\nMoreover, this feature lets you make incompatible changes to Activity Definitions in conjunction with incompatible changes to Workflow Definitions that use those Activities.\nThis functionality works because any Activity that a Workflow schedules on the same Task Queue gets dispatched only to Workers compatible with the Workflow that scheduled it.\nIf you want to change an Activity Definition's type signature while creating a new incompatible Build ID for a Worker, you can do so without worrying about the Activity failing to execute on some other Worker with an incompatible definition.\nThe same principle applies to Child Workflows.\n\n:::tip\n\nPublic-facing Workflows on a versioned Task Queue shouldn't change their signatures because doing so contradicts the purpose of Workflow-launching Clients remaining unaware of changes in the Workflow Definition.\nIf you need to change a Workflow's signature, use a different Workflow Type or a completely new Task Queue.\n\n:::\n\n:::note\n\nIf you schedule an Activity or a Child Workflow on _a different_ Task Queue from the one the Workflow runs on, the system doesn't assign a specific version.\nThis means if the target queue is versioned, they run on the latest default, and if it's unversioned, they operate as they would have without this feature.\n\n:::\n\n**Continue-As-New and Worker Versioning**\n\nBy default, a versioned Task Queue's Continue-as-New function starts the continued Workflow on the same compatible set as the original Workflow.\n\nIf you continue-as-new onto a different Task Queue, the system doesn't assign any particular version.\nYou also have the option to specify that the continued Workflow should start using the Task Queue's latest default version.\n\n### How to use Worker Versioning\n\nTo use Worker Versioning, follow these steps:\n\n1. Define Worker build-identifier version sets for the Task Queue.\n   You can use either the `temporal` CLI or your choice of SDK.\n2. Enable the feature on your Worker by specifying a Build ID.\n\n#### Defining the version sets\n\nWhether you use [Temporal CLI](/cli/) or an SDK, updating the version sets feels the same.\nYou specify the Task Queue that you're targeting, the Build ID that you're adding (or promoting), whether it becomes the new default version, and any existing versions it should be considered compatible with.\n\nThe rest of this section uses updates to one Task Queue's version sets as examples.\n\nBy default, both Task Queues and Workers are in an unversioned state.\n[Unversioned Worker](#unversioned-workers) can poll unversioned Task Queues and receive tasks.\nTo use this feature, both the Task Queue and the Worker must be associated with Build IDs.\n\nIf you run a Worker using versioning against a Task Queue that has not been set up to use versioning (or is missing that Worker's Build ID), it won't get any tasks.\nLikewise, a unversioned Worker polling a Task Queue with versioning won't work either.\n\n:::note Versions don't need to follow semver or any other semantic versioning scheme!\n\nThe versions in the following examples look like semver versions for clarity, but they don't need to be.\nVersions can be any arbitrary string.\n\n:::\n\nFirst, add a version `1.0` to the Task Queue as the new default.\nYour version sets now look like this:\n\n| set 1 (default) |\n| --------------- |\n| 1.0 (default)   |\n\nAll new Workflows started on the Task Queue have their first tasks assigned to version `1.0`.\nWorkers with their Build ID set to `1.0` receive these Tasks.\n\nIf Workflows that don't have an assigned version are still running on the Task Queue, Workers without a version take those tasks.\nSo ensure that such Workers are still operational if any Workflows were open when you added the first version.\nIf you deployed any Workers with a _different_ version, those Workers receive no Tasks.\n\nNow, imagine you need change the Workflow for some reason.\n\nAdd `2.0` to the sets as the new default:\n\n| set 1         | set 2 (default) |\n| ------------- | --------------- |\n| 1.0 (default) | 2.0 (default)   |\n\nAll new Workflows started on the Task Queue have their first tasks assigned to version `2.0`.\nExisting `1.0` Workflows keep generating tasks targeting `1.0`.\nEach deployment of Workers receives their respective Tasks.\nThis same concept carries forward for each new incompatible version.\n\nMaybe you have a bug in `2.0`, and you want to make sure all open `2.0` Workflows switch to some new code as fast as possible.\nSo, you add `2.1` to the sets, marking it as compatible with `2.0`.\nNow your sets look like this:\n\n| set 1         | set 2 (default) |\n| ------------- | --------------- |\n| 1.0 (default) | 2.0             |\n|               | 2.1 (default)   |\n\nAll new Workflow Tasks that are generated for Workflows whose last Workflow Task completion was on version `2.0` are now assigned to version `2.1`.\nBecause you specified that `2.1` is compatible with `2.0`, Temporal Server assumes that Workers with this version can process the existing Event Histories successfully.\n\nContinue with your normal development cycle, adding a `3.0` version.\nNothing new here:\n\n| set 1         | set 2         | set 3 (default) |\n| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |\n| 1.0 (default) | 2.0           | 3.0 (default)   |\n|               | 2.1 (default) |                 |\n\nNow imagine that version `3.0` doesn't have an explicit bug, but something about the business logic\nis less than ideal.\nYou are okay with existing `3.0` Workflows running to completion, but you want new Workflows to use the old `2.x` branch.\nThis operation is supported by performing an update targeting `2.1` (or `2.0`) and setting its set as the current default, which results in these sets:\n\n| set 1         | set 3         | set 2 (default) |\n| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |\n| 1.0 (default) | 3.0 (default) | 2.0             |\n|               |               | 2.1 (default)   |\n\nNow new Workflows start on `2.1`.\n\n#### Permitted and forbidden operations on version sets\n\nA request to change the sets can do one of the following:\n\n- Add a version to the sets as the new default version in a new overall-default compatible set.\n- Add a version to an existing set that's compatible with an existing version.\n  - Optionally making it the default for that set.\n  - Optionally making that set the overall-default set.\n- Promote a version within an existing set to become the default for that set.\n- Promote a set to become the overall-default set.\n\nYou can't explicitly delete versions.This helps you avoid the situation in which Workflows accidentally become stuck with no means of making progress because the version they're associated with no longer exists.\n\nHowever, sometimes you might want to do this intentionally.\nIf you _want_ to make sure that all Workflows currently being processed by, say, `2.0` stop (even if you don't yet have a new version ready), you can add a new version `2.1` to the sets marked as compatible with `2.0`.\nNew tasks will target `2.1`, but because you haven't deployed any `2.1` Workers, they won't make any progress.\n\n#### Set constraints\n\nThe sets have a maximum size limit, which defaults to 100 build IDs across all sets.\nThis limit is configurable on Temporal Server via the `limit.versionBuildIdLimitPerQueue` dynamic config property.\nOperations to add new Build IDs to the sets fail if the limit would be exceeded.\n\nThere is also a limit on the number of sets, which defaults to 10.\nThis limit is configurable via the `limit.versionCompatibleSetLimitPerQueue` dynamic config property.\n\nIn practice, these limits should rarely be a concern because a version is no longer needed after no open Workflows are using that version, and a background process will delete IDs and sets that are no longer needed.\n\nThere is also a limit on the size of each Build ID or version string, which defaults to 255 characters.\nThis limit is configurable on the server via the `limit.workerBuildIdSize` dynamic config property.\n\n### Build ID reachability\n\nEventually, you'll want to know whether you can retire the old Worker versions.\nTemporal provides functionality to help you determine whether a version is still in use by open or closed Workflows.\nYou can use the Temporal CLI to do this with the following command:\n\n```command\ntemporal task-queue get-build-id-reachability\n```\n\nThe command determines, for each Task Queue, whether the Build ID in question is unreachable, only reachable by closed Workflows, or reachable by open and new Workfloww.\nFor example, this \"2.0\" Build ID is shown here by the CLI to be reachable by both new Workflows and some existing Workflows:\n\n```command\ntemporal task-queue get-build-id-reachability --build-id \"2.0\"\n```\n\n```output\nBuildId                         TaskQueue                                   Reachability\n    2.0  build-id-versioning-dc0068f6-0426-428f-b0b2-703a7e409a97  [NewWorkflows\n                                                                   ExistingWorkflows]\n```\n\nFor more information, see the [CLI documentation](/cli/) or help output.\n\nYou can also use this API `GetWorkerTaskReachability` directly from within language SDKs.\n\n### Unversioned Workers\n\nUnversioned Workers refer to Workers that have not opted into the Worker Versioning feature in their configuration.\nThey receive tasks only from Task Queues that do not have any version sets defined on them, or that have open workflows that began executing before versions were added to the queue.\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"concepts","guide_id":"workers","slug":"/workers","local_ref":"worker","node_id":"concepts/what-is-a-worker","node_title":"What is a Worker?","node_description":"In day-to-day conversations, the term Worker is used to denote both a Worker Program and a Worker Process.

Definition using the Go SDK](/go/developing-workflows)\n- [How to develop a Workflow Definition using the Java SDK](/java/how-to-develop-a-workflow-definition-in-java)\n- [How to develop a Workflow Definition using the PHP SDK](/php/developing-workflows)\n- [How to develop a Workflow Definition using the Python SDK](/python/developing-workflows)\n- [How to develop a Workflow Definition using the TypeScript SDK](/typescript/developing-workflows)\n\nA Workflow Definition is often also referred to as a Workflow Function.\nIn Temporal's documentation, a Workflow Definition refers to the source for the instance of a Workflow Execution, while a Workflow Function refers to the source for the instance of a Workflow Function Execution.\n\nA Workflow Execution effectively executes once to completion, while a Workflow Function Execution occurs many times during the life of a Workflow Execution.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you write a Workflow Definition in a language that has a corresponding Temporal SDK.\n\n### Deterministic constraints\n\nA critical aspect of developing Workflow Definitions is ensuring they exhibit certain deterministic traits – that is, making sure that the same Commands are emitted in the same sequence, whenever a corresponding Workflow Function Execution (instance of the Function Definition) is re-executed.\n\nThe execution semantics of a Workflow Execution include the re-execution of a Workflow Function, which is called a [Replay](#replays).\nThe use of Workflow APIs in the function is what generates [Commands](/concepts/what-is-a-command).\nCommands tell the Cluster which Events to create and add to the Workflow Execution's Event History.\nWhen a Workflow Function executes, the Commands that are emitted are compared with the existing Event History.\nIf a corresponding Event already exists within the Event History that maps to the generation of that Command in the same sequence, and some specific metadata of that Command matches with some specific metadata of the Event, then the Function Execution progresses.\n\nFor example, using an SDK's \"Execute Activity\" API generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands/#scheduleactivitytask) Command.\nWhen this API is called upon re-execution, that Command is compared with the Event that is in the same location within the sequence.\nThe Event in the sequence must be an [ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events/#activitytaskscheduled) Event, where the Activity name is the same as what is in the Command.\n\nIf a generated Command doesn't match what it needs to in the existing Event History, then the Workflow Execution returns a _non-deterministic_ error.\n\nThe following are the two reasons why a Command might be generated out of sequence or the wrong Command might be generated altogether:\n\n1. Code changes are made to a Workflow Definition that is in use by a running Workflow Execution.\n2. There is intrinsic non-deterministic logic (such as inline random branching).\n\n### Code changes can cause non-deterministic behavior {#non-deterministic-change}\n\nThe Workflow Definition can change in very limited ways once there is a Workflow Execution depending on it.\nTo alleviate non-deterministic issues that arise from code changes, we recommend using [Workflow Versioning](#workflow-versioning).\n\nFor example, let's say we have a Workflow Definition that defines the following sequence:\n\n1. Start and wait on a Timer/sleep.\n2. Spawn and wait on an Activity Execution.\n3. Complete.\n\nWe start a Worker and spawn a Workflow Execution that uses that Workflow Definition.\nThe Worker would emit the [StartTimer](/references/commands/#starttimer) Command and the Workflow Execution would become suspended.\n\nBefore the Timer is up, we change the Workflow Definition to the following sequence:\n\n1. Spawn and wait on an Activity Execution.\n2. Start and wait on a Timer/sleep.\n3. Complete.\n\nWhen the Timer fires, the next Workflow Task will cause the Workflow Function to re-execute.\nThe first Command the Worker sees would be ScheduleActivityTask Command, which wouldn't match up to the expected [TimerStarted](/references/events/#timerstarted) Event.\n\nThe Workflow Execution would fail and return a non-deterministic error.\n\nThe following are examples of minor changes that would not result in non-determinism errors when re-executing a History which already contain the Events:\n\n- Changing the duration of a Timer, with the following exceptions:\n  - In Java, Python, and Go, changing a Timer’s duration from or to 0 is a non-deterministic behavior.\n  - In .NET, changing a Timer’s duration from or to -1 (which means \"infinite\") is a non-deterministic behavior.\n- Changing the arguments to:\n  - The Activity Options in a call to spawn an Activity Execution (local or nonlocal).\n  - The Child Workflow Options in a call to spawn a Child Workflow Execution.\n  - Call to Signal an External Workflow Execution.\n- Adding a Signal Handler for a Signal Type that has not been sent to this Workflow Execution.\n\n### Intrinsic non-deterministic logic\n\nIntrinsic non-determinism is when a Workflow Function Execution might emit a different sequence of Commands on re-execution, regardless of whether all the input parameters are the same.\n\nFor example, a Workflow Definition can not have inline logic that branches (emits a different Command sequence) based off a local time setting or a random number.\nIn the representative pseudocode below, the `local_clock()` function returns the local time, rather than Temporal-defined time:\n\n```text\nfn your_workflow() {\n  if local_clock().is_before(\"12pm\") {\n    await workflow.sleep(duration_until(\"12pm\"))\n  } else {\n    await your_afternoon_activity()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEach Temporal SDK offers APIs that enable Workflow Definitions to have logic that gets and uses time, random numbers, and data from unreliable resources.\nWhen those APIs are used, the results are stored as part of the Event History, which means that a re-executed Workflow Function will issue the same sequence of Commands, even if there is branching involved.\n\nIn other words, all operations that do not purely mutate the Workflow Execution's state should occur through a Temporal SDK API.\n\n### Workflow Versioning {#workflow-versioning}\n\nThe Workflow Versioning feature enables the creation of logical branching inside a Workflow Definition based on a developer specified version identifier.\nThis feature is useful for Workflow Definition logic needs to be updated, but there are running Workflow Executions that currently depends on it.\nIt is important to note that a practical way to handle different versions of Workflow Definitions, without using the versioning API, is to run the different versions on separate Task Queues.\n\n- [How to version Workflow Definitions in Go](/go/versioning)\n- [How to version Workflow Definitions in Java](/java/versioning)\n- [How to version Workflow Definitions in TypeScript](/typescript/versioning)\n\n### Handling unreliable Worker Processes\n\nYou do not handle Worker Process failure or restarts in a Workflow Definition.\n\nWorkflow Function Executions are completely oblivious to the Worker Process in terms of failures or downtime.\nThe Temporal Platform ensures that the state of a Workflow Execution is recovered and progress resumes if there is an outage of either Worker Processes or the Temporal Cluster itself.\nThe only reason a Workflow Execution might fail is due to the code throwing an error or exception, not because of underlying infrastructure outages.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-workflow-type.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type","title":"What is a Workflow Type?","description":"A Workflow Type is a name that maps to a Workflow Definition.","label":"Workflow Type","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Workflow Type is a name that maps to a Workflow Definition.\n\n- A single Workflow Type can be instantiated as multiple Workflow Executions.\n- A Workflow Type is scoped by a Task Queue.\n  It is acceptable to have the same Workflow Type name map to different Workflow Definitions if they are using completely different Workers.\n\n![Workflow Type cardinality with Workflow Definitions and Workflow Executions](/diagrams/workflow-type-cardinality.svg)\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-workflow-execution.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution","title":"What is a Workflow Execution?","description":"A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution.

During a Replay the Commands that are generated are checked against an existing Event History. Replays are necessary and often happen to give the effect that Workflow Executions are resumable, reliable, and durable.\n\nFor more information, see [Deterministic constraints](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints).\n\nIf a failure occurs, the Workflow Execution picks up where the last recorded event occurred in the Event History.\n\n- [How to use Replay APIs using the Go SDK](/go/replays)\n- [How to use Replay APIs using the Java SDK](/java/replays)\n- [How to use Replay APIs using the Python SDK](/python/replays)\n- [How to use Replay APIs using the TypeScript SDK](/typescript/replays)\n\n### Commands and awaitables\n\nA Workflow Execution does two things:\n\n1. Issue [Commands](/concepts/what-is-a-command).\n2. Wait on an Awaitables (often called Futures).\n\n![Command generation and waiting](/diagrams/workflow-execution-progession-simple.svg)\n\nCommands are issued and Awaitables are provided by the use of Workflow APIs in the [Workflow Definition](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition).\n\nCommands are generated whenever the Workflow Function is executed.\nThe Worker Process supervises the Command generation and makes sure that it maps to the current Event History.\n(For more information, see [Deterministic constraints](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints).)\nThe Worker Process batches the Commands and then suspends progress to send the Commands to the Cluster whenever the Workflow Function reaches a place where it can no longer progress without a result from an Awaitable.\n\nA Workflow Execution may only ever block progress on an Awaitable that is provided through a Temporal SDK API.\nAwaitables are provided when using APIs for the following:\n\n- Awaiting: Progress can block using explicit \"Await\" APIs.\n- Requesting cancellation of another Workflow Execution: Progress can block on confirmation that the other Workflow Execution is cancelled.\n- Sending a [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal): Progress can block on confirmation that the Signal sent.\n- Spawning a [Child Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-child-workflow-execution): Progress can block on confirmation that the Child Workflow Execution started, and on the result of the Child Workflow Execution.\n- Spawning an [Activity Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution): Progress can block on the result of the Activity Execution.\n- Starting a Timer: Progress can block until the Timer fires.\n\n### Status\n\nA Workflow Execution can be either Open or Closed.\n\n![Workflow Execution statuses](/diagrams/workflow-execution-statuses.svg)\n\n**Open**\n\n- Running: The only Open status for a Workflow Execution.\n  When the Workflow Execution is Running, it is either actively progressing or is waiting on something.\n\n**Closed**\n\nA Closed status means that the Workflow Execution cannot make further progress because of one of the following reasons:\n\n- Cancelled: The Workflow Execution successfully handled a cancellation request.\n- Completed: The Workflow Execution has completed successfully.\n- Continued-As-New: The Workflow Execution [Continued-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new).\n- Failed: The Workflow Execution returned an error and failed.\n- Terminated: The Workflow Execution was terminated.\n- Timed Out: The Workflow Execution reached a timeout limit.\n\n### Workflow Execution Chain\n\nA Workflow Execution Chain is a sequence of Workflow Executions that share the same Workflow Id.\nEach link in the Chain is often called a Workflow Run.\nEach Workflow Run in the sequence is connected by one of the following:\n\n- [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new)\n- [Retries](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy)\n- [Temporal Cron Job](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job)\n\nA Workflow Execution is uniquely identified by its [Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace), [Workflow Id](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id), and [Run Id](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id).\n\nThe [Workflow Execution Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout) applies to a Workflow Execution Chain.\nThe [Workflow Run Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-run-timeout) applies to a single Workflow Execution (Workflow Run).\n\n### Event loop\n\nA Workflow Execution is made up of a sequence of [Events](/concepts/what-is-an-event) called an [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history).\nEvents are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to either Commands or actions requested by a Temporal Client (such as a request to spawn a Workflow Execution).\n\n![Workflow Execution](/diagrams/workflow-execution-swim-lane-01.svg)\n\n### Time constraints\n\n**Is there a limit to how long Workflows can run?**\n\nNo, there is no time constraint on how long a Workflow Execution can be Running.\n\nHowever, Workflow Executions intended to run indefinitely should be written with some care.\nThe Temporal Cluster stores the complete Event History for the entire lifecycle of a Workflow Execution.\nThe Temporal Cluster logs a warning after 10Ki (10,240) Events and periodically logs additional warnings as new Events are added.\nIf the Event History exceeds 50Ki (51,200) Events, the Workflow Execution is terminated.\n\nTo prevent _runaway_ Workflow Executions, you can use the Workflow Execution Timeout, the Workflow Run Timeout, or both.\nA Workflow Execution Timeout can be used to limit the duration of Workflow Execution Chain, and a Workflow Run Timeout can be used to limit the duration an individual Workflow Execution (Run).\n\nYou can use the [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new) feature to close the current Workflow Execution and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation.\nThe Workflow Execution spawned from Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.\nFor example, it may be reasonable to use Continue-As-New once per day for a long-running Workflow Execution that is generating a large Event History.\n\n### Limits\n\nEach pending Activity generates a metadata entry in the Workflow's mutable state.\nToo many entries create a large mutable state, which causes unstable persistence.\n\nTo protect the system, Temporal enforces a maximum of 50,000 pending Activities, Child Workflows, Signals, and Workflow cancellation requests.\nCurrently, there is no limit on the total number of Signals that a Workflow Execution can receive. <!--From Temporal server v1.21, the default maximum number of Signals that a Workflow Execution can receive is 10000. -->\nThese limits are set with the following [dynamic configuration keys](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/service/history/configs/config.go):\n\n- `limit.numPendingActivities.error`\n- `limit.numPendingChildExecutions.error`\n- `limit.numPendingSignals.error`\n- `limit.numPendingCancelRequests.error`\n- `history.maximumSignalsPerExecution`\n\nBy default, Temporal fails Workflow Task Executions that would cause the Workflow to surpass 50,000 <!--2000 in from v1.21--> pending Activities, Child Workflows, Workflow cancellation requests, or Signals. <!-- The Workflow Execution fails if the number of pending Signals exceeds 2000, or if the total number of Signals received exceeds 10000. -->\nSimilar constraints are enforced for `SignalExternalWorkflowExecution`, `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution`, and `StartChildWorkflowExecution` Commands.\n\n:::note\n\nCloud users are limited to 2,000 each of pending Activities, Child Workflows, Workflow cancellation requests, and Signals.\n\n:::\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-a-command","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-command.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-command.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-command","title":"What

History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history).\n\nA list of all possible Events that could appear in a Workflow Execution Event History is provided in the [Event reference](/references/events).\n\n#### Activity Events\n\nSeven Activity-related Events are added to Event History at various points in an Activity Execution:\n\n- After a [Workflow Task Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution) reaches a line of code that starts/executes an Activity, the Worker sends the Activity Type and arguments to the Temporal Cluster, and the Cluster adds an [ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events#activitytaskscheduled) Event to Event History.\n- When `ActivityTaskScheduled` is added to History, the Cluster adds a corresponding Activity Task to the Task Queue.\n- A Worker polling that Task Queue picks up the Activity Task and runs the Activity function or method.\n- If the Activity function returns, the Worker reports completion to the Cluster, and the Cluster adds [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events#activitytaskstarted) and [ActivityTaskCompleted](/references/events#activitytaskcompleted) to Event History.\n- If the Activity function throws a [non-retryable Failure](/kb/failures#non-retryable), the Cluster adds [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events#activitytaskstarted) and [ActivityTaskFailed](/references/events#activitytaskfailed) to Event History.\n- If the Activity function throws an error or retryable Failure, the Cluster schedules an Activity Task retry to be added to the Task Queue (unless you’ve reached the Maximum Attempts value of the [Retry Policy](/retry-policies), in which case the Cluster adds [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events#activitytaskstarted) and [ActivityTaskFailed](/references/events#activitytaskfailed) to Event History).\n- If the Activity’s [Start-to-Close Timeout](/activities#start-to-close-timeout) passes before the Activity function returns or throws, the Cluster schedules a retry.\n- If the Activity’s [Schedule-to-Close Timeout](/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout) passes before Activity Execution is complete, or if [Schedule-to-Start Timeout](/activities#schedule-to-start-timeout) passes before a Worker gets the Activity Task, the Cluster writes [ActivityTaskTimedOut](/references/events#activitytasktimedout) to Event History.\n- If the Activity is [canceled](/activities#cancellation), the Cluster writes [ActivityTaskCancelRequested](/references/events#activitytaskcancelrequested) to Event History, and if the Activity accepts cancellation, the Cluster writes [ActivityTaskCanceled](/references/events#activitytaskcanceled).\n\n:::note\n\nWhile the Activity is running and retrying,

while also returning a value to the caller.\nThe Update handler listens for Updates by the Update's name.\n\nWhen there is the potential for multiple Updates to cause a duplication problem, Temporal recommends adding idempotency logic to your Update handler that checks for duplicates.\n\nAn Update has four phases.\n\n1. **Admission.** The Temporal Cluster first validates Update submissions against the configured resource usage limits.\n   For example, limits apply to concurrent requests and requests per second.\n   See the [Temporal Platform limits sheet](/kb/temporal-platform-limits-sheet) for more details.\n   When this phase is complete, the Platform changes the status of the Update to **Admitted**.\n   At this stage, the Platform hasn't yet persisted the Update to the Workflow Execution's Event History or sent it to a Worker.\n1. **Validation.** An optional developer provided function that performs request validation.\n   This validation code, similar to a [Query](/concepts/what-is-a-query) handler, can observe but not change the Workflow state.\n   This means that the validation of an Update request may depend on the Workflow state at runtime.\n   If an Update request doesn't pass validation at this stage, the system rejects the request and doesn't record anything in the Workflow Event History to indicate that the Update ever happened.\n   The Update processing doesn't proceed to later phases.\n   When the Update completes the validation stage, the Platform changes its state to **Accepted**.\n   A [WorkflowExecutionUpdateAcceptedEvent](/references/events#workflowexecutionupdateacceptedevent) Event in the Workflow Execution [Event History](#event-history) denotes the acceptance of an Update.\n1. **Execution.** Accepted Update requests move to the execution phase.\n   In this phase, the Worker delivers the request to the Update handler.\n   Like every bit of code in a Workflow, Update handlers must be [deterministic](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints).\n1. **Completion.** The Update handler can return a result or a language-appropriate error/exception to indicate its completion.\n   The Platform sends the Update outcome back to the original invoking entity as an Update response.\n   A

Requests or Terminations to Child Workflow Executions depending on the Child's Parent Close Policy.\n\nIf a Child Workflow Execution uses Continue-As-New, from the Parent Workflow Execution's perspective the entire chain of Runs is treated as a single execution.\n\n![Parent and Child Workflow Execution entity relationship with Continue As New](/diagrams/parent-child-workflow-execution-with-continue-as-new.svg)\n\n### When to use Child Workflows\n\n**Consider Workflow Execution Event History size limits.**\n\nAn individual Workflow Execution has an [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history) size limit, which imposes a couple of considerations for using Child Workflows.\n\nOn one hand, because Child Workflow Executions have their own Event Histories, they are often used to partition large workloads into smaller chunks.\nFor example, a single Workflow Execution does not have enough space in its Event History to spawn 100,000 [Activity Executions](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution).\nBut a Parent Workflow Execution can spawn 1,000 Child Workflow Executions that each spawn 1,000 Activity Executions to achieve a total of 1,000,000 Activity Executions.\n\nHowever, because a Parent Workflow Execution Event History contains [Events](/concepts/what-is-an-event) that correspond to the status of the Child Workflow Execution, a single Parent should not spawn more than 1,000 Child Workflow Executions.\n\nIn general, however, Child Workflow Executions result in more overall Events recorded in Event Histories than Activities.\nBecause each entry in an Event History is a _cost_ in terms of compute resources, this could become a factor in very large workloads.\nTherefore, we recommend starting with a single Workflow implementation that uses Activities until there is a clear need for Child Workflows.\n\n**Consider each Child Workflow Execution as a separate service.**\n\nBecause a Child Workflow Execution can be processed by a completely separate set of [Workers](/concepts/what-is-a-worker) than the Parent Workflow Execution, it can act as an entirely separate service.\nHowever, this also means that a Parent Workflow Execution and a Child Workflow Execution do not share any local state.\nAs all Workflow Executions, they can communicate only via asynchronous [Signals](/concepts/what-is-a-signal).\n\n**Consider that a single Child Workflow Execution can represent a single resource.**\n\nAs all Workflow Executions, a Child Workflow Execution can create a one to one mapping with a resource.\nFor example, a Workflow that manages host upgrades could spawn a Child Workflow Execution per host.\n\n### When to use a Child Workflow versus an Activity\n\nChild Workflow Executions and Activity Executions are both started from Workflows, so you might feel confused about when to use which.\nHere are some important differences:\n\n- A Child Workflow has access to all Workflow APIs but is subject to the same [deterministic constraints](/workflows#deterministic-constraints) as other Workflows.\n  An Activity has the inverse pros and cons—no access to Workflow APIs but no Workflow constraints.\n- A Child Workflow Execution can continue on if its Parent is canceled with a [Parent Close Policy](/concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy) of `ABANDON`.\n  An Activity Execution is _always_ canceled when its Workflow Execution is canceled.\n  (It can react to a cancellation Signal for cleanup.)\n  The decision is roughly analogous to spawning a child process in a terminal to do work versus doing work in the same process.\n- Temporal tracks all state changes within a Child Workflow Execution in Event History.\n  Only the input, output, and retry attempts of an Activity Execution is tracked.\n\nA Workflow models composite operations that consist of multiple Activities or other Child Workflows.\nAn Activity usually models a single operation on the external world.\n\nOur advice: **When in doubt, use an Activity.**\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-parent-close-policy.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy","title":"What

Temporal Server will spawn an execution for the associated Workflow Type per the schedule.\n\nEach Workflow Execution within the series is considered a Run.\n\n- Each Run receives the same input parameters as the initial Run.\n- Each Run inherits the same Workflow Options as the initial Run.\n\nThe Temporal Server spawns the first Workflow Execution in the chain of Runs immediately.\nHowever, it calculates and applies a backoff (`firstWorkflowTaskBackoff`) so that the first Workflow Task of the Workflow Execution does not get placed into a Task Queue until the scheduled time.\nAfter each Run Completes, Fails, or reaches the [Workflow Run Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-run-timeout), the same thing happens: the next run will be created immediately with a new `firstWorkflowTaskBackoff` that is calculated based on the current Server time and the defined Cron Schedule.\n\nThe Temporal Server spawns the next Run only after the current Run has Completed, Failed, or has reached the Workflow Run Timeout.\nThis means that, if a Retry Policy has also been provided, and a Run Fails or reaches the Workflow Run Timeout, the Run will first be retried per the Retry Policy until the Run Completes or the Retry Policy has been exhausted.\nIf the next Run, per the Cron Schedule, is due to spawn while the current Run is still Open (including retries), the Server automatically starts the new Run after the current Run completes successfully.\nThe start time for this new Run and the Cron definitions are used to calculate the `firstWorkflowTaskBackoff` that is applied to the new Run.\n\nA [Workflow Execution Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout) is used to limit how long a Workflow can be executing (have an Open status), including retries and any usage of Continue As New.\nThe Cron Schedule runs until the Workflow Execution Timeout is reached or you terminate the Workflow.\n\n![Temporal Cron Job Run Failure with a Retry Policy](/diagrams/temporal-cron-job-failure-with-retry.svg)\n\n### Cron Schedules\n\nCron Schedules are interpreted in UTC time by default.\n\nThe Cron Schedule is provided as a string and must follow one of two specifications:\n\n**Classic specification**\n\nThis is what the \"classic\" specification looks like:\n\n```\n┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)\n│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)\n│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)\n│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)\n│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)\n│ │ │ │ │\n│ │ │ │ │\n* * * * *\n```\n\nFor example, `15 8 * * *` causes a Workflow Execution to spawn daily at 8:15 AM UTC.\nUse the [crontab guru site](https://crontab.guru/) to test your cron expressions.\n\n### `robfig` predefined schedules and intervals\n\nYou can also pass any of the [predefined schedules](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3#hdr-Predefined_schedules) or [intervals](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3#hdr-Intervals) described in the [`robfig/cron` documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3).\n\n```\n| Schedules              | Description                                | Equivalent To |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |\n| @yearly (or @annually) | Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st        | 0 0 1 1 *     |\n| @monthly               | Run once a month, midnight, first of month | 0 0 1 * *     |\n| @weekly                | Run once a week, midnight between Sat/Sun  | 0 0 * * 0     |\n| @daily (or @midnight)  | Run once a day, midnight                   | 0 0 * * *     |\n| @hourly                | Run once an hour, beginning of hour        | 0 * * * *     |\n```\n\nFor example, \"@weekly\" causes a Workflow Execution to spawn once a week at midnight between Saturday and Sunday.\n\nIntervals just take a string that can be accepted by [time.ParseDuration](http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).\n\n```\n@every <duration>\n```\n\n### Time zones\n\n_This feature only applies in Temporal 1.15 and up_\n\nYou can change the time zone that a Cron Schedule is interpreted in by prefixing the specification with `CRON_TZ=America/New_York` (or your [desired time zone from tz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)). `CRON_TZ=America/New_York 15 8 * * *` therefore spawns a Workflow Execution every day at 8:15 AM New York time, subject to caveats listed below.\n\nConsider that using time zones in production introduces a surprising amount of complexity and failure modes!\n**If at all possible, we recommend specifying Cron Schedules in UTC (the default)**.\n\nIf you need to use time zones, here are a few edge cases to keep in mind:\n\n- **Beware Daylight Saving Time**: If a Temporal Cron Job is scheduled around the time when daylight saving time (DST) begins or ends (for example, `30 2 * * *`), **it might run zero, one, or two times in a day**! The Cron library that we use does not do any special handling of DST transitions. Avoid schedules that include times that fall within DST transition periods.\n  - For example, in the US, DST begins at 2 AM. When you \"fall back,\" the clock goes `1:59 … 1:00 … 1:01 … 1:59 … 2:00 … 2:01 AM` and any Cron jobs that fall in that 1 AM hour are fired again. The inverse happens when clocks \"spring forward\" for DST, and Cron jobs that fall in the 2 AM hour are skipped.\n  - In other time zones like Chile and Iran, DST \"spring forward\" is at midnight. 11:59 PM is followed by 1 AM, which means `00:00:00` never happens.\n- **Self Hosting note**: If you manage your own Temporal Cluster, you are responsible for ensuring that it has access to current `tzdata` files. The official Docker images are built with [tzdata](https://docs.w3cub.com/go/time/tzdata/index) installed (provided by Alpine Linux), but ultimately you should be aware of how tzdata is deployed and updated in your infrastructure.\n- **Updating Temporal**: If you use the official Docker images, note that an upgrade of the Temporal Cluster may include an update to the tzdata files, which may change the meaning of your Cron Schedule. You should be aware of upcoming changes to the definitions of the time zones you use, particularly around daylight saving time start/end dates.\n- **Absolute Time Fixed at Start**: The absolute start time of the next Run is computed and stored in the database when the previous Run completes, and is not recomputed. This means that if you have a Cron Schedule that runs very infrequently, and the definition of the time zone changes between one Run and the next, the Run might happen at the wrong time. For example, `CRON_TZ=America/Los_Angeles 0 12 11 11 *` means \"noon in Los Angeles on November 11\" (normally not in DST). If at some point the government makes any changes (for example, move the end of DST one week later, or stay on permanent DST year-round), the meaning of that specification changes. In that first year, the Run happens at the wrong time, because it was computed using the older definition.\n\n### How to stop a Temporal Cron Job\n\nA Temporal Cron Job does not stop spawning Runs until it has been Terminated or until the [Workflow Execution Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout) is reached.\n\nA Cancellation Request affects only the current Run.\n\nUse the Workflow Id in any requests to Cancel or Terminate.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"concepts/what-is-a-schedule","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-schedule.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-schedule.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-schedule","title":"What

Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) at specific times.\nSchedules provide a more flexible and user-friendly approach than [Temporal Cron Jobs](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job).\n\n- [How to enable Schedules](#limitations)\n- [How to operate Schedules using tctl](/tctl-v1/schedule#)\n\nA Schedule has an identity and is independent of a Workflow Execution.\nThis differs from a Temporal Cron Job, which relies on a cron schedule as a property of the Workflow Execution.\n\n### Action\n\nThe Action of a Schedule is where the Workflow Execution properties are established, such as Workflow Type, Task Queue, parameters, and timeouts.\n\nWorkflow Executions started by a Schedule have the following additional properties:\n\n- The Action's timestamp is appended to the Workflow Id.\n- The `TemporalScheduledStartTime` [Search Attribute](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute) is added to the Workflow Execution.\n  The value is the Action's timestamp.\n- The `TemporalScheduledById` Search Attribute is added to the Workflow Execution.\n  The value is the Schedule Id.\n\n### Spec\n\nThe Schedule Spec describes when the Action is taken.\nThere are two kinds of Schedule Spec:\n\n- A simple interval, like \"every 30 minutes\" (aligned to start at the Unix epoch, and optionally including a phase offset).\n- A calendar-based expression, similar to the \"cron expressions\" supported by lots of software, including the older Temporal Cron feature.\n\nThese two kinds have multiple representations, depending on the interface or SDK you're using, but they all support the same features.\n\nIn tctl, for example, an interval is specified as a string like `45m` to mean every 45 minutes, or `6h/5h` to mean every 6 hours but at the start of the fifth hour within each period.\n\nIn tctl, a calendar expression can be specified as either a traditional cron string with five (or six or seven) positional fields, or as JSON with named fields:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"year\": \"2022\",\n  \"month\": \"Jan,Apr,Jul,Oct\",\n  \"dayOfMonth\": \"1,15\",\n  \"hour\": \"11-14\"\n}\n```\n\nThe following calendar JSON fields are available:\n\n- `year`\n- `month`\n- `dayOfMonth`\n- `dayOfWeek`\n- `hour`\n- `minute`\n- `second`\n- `comment`\n\nEach field can contain a comma-separated list of ranges (or the `*` wildcard), and each range can include a slash followed by a skip value.\nThe `hour`, `minute`, and `second` fields default to `0` while the others default to `*`, so you can describe many useful specs with only a few fields.\n\nFor `month`, names of months may be used instead of integers (case-insensitive, abbreviations permitted).\nFor `dayOfWeek`, day-of-week names may be used.\n\nThe `comment` field is optional and can be used to include a free-form description of the intent of the calendar spec, useful for complicated specs.\n\nNo matter which form you supply, calendar and interval specs are converted to canonical representations.\nWhat you see when you \"describe\" or \"list\" a Schedule might not look exactly like what you entered, but it has the same meaning.\n\nOther Spec features:\n\n**Multiple intervals/calendar expressions:** A Spec can have combinations of multiple intervals and/or calendar expressions to define a specific Schedule.\n\n**Time bounds:** Provide an absolute start or end time (or both) with a Spec to ensure that no actions are taken before the start time or after the end time.\n\n**Exclusions:** A Spec can contain exclusions in the form of zero or more calendar expressions.\nThis can be used to express scheduling like \"each Monday at noon except for holidays.\nYou'll have to provide your own set of exclusions and include it in each schedule; there are no pre-defined sets.\n(This feature isn't currently exposed in tctl or the Temporal Web UI.)\n\n**Jitter:** If given, a random offset between zero and the maximum jitter is added to each Action time (but bounded by the time until the next scheduled Action).\n\n**Time zones:** By default, calendar-based expressions are interpreted in UTC.\nTemporal recommends using UTC to avoid various surprising properties of time zones.\nIf you don't want to use UTC, you can provide the name of a time zone.\nThe time zone definition is loaded on the Temporal Server Worker Service from either disk or the fallback embedded in the binary.\n\nFor more operational control, embed the contents of the time zone database file in the Schedule Spec itself.\n(Note: this isn't currently exposed in tctl or the web UI.)\n\n### Pause\n\nA Schedule can be Paused.\nWhen a Schedule is Paused, the Spec has no effect.\nHowever, you can still force manual actions by using the [tctl schedule trigger](/tctl-v1/schedule#trigger) command.\n\nTo assist communication among developers and operators, a “notes” field can be updated on pause or resume to store an explanation for the current state.\n\n### Backfill\n\nA Schedule can be Backfilled.\nWhen a Schedule is Backfilled, all the Actions that would have been taken over a specified time period are taken now (in parallel if the `AllowAll` [Overlap Policy](#overlap-policy) is used; sequentially if `BufferAll` is used).\nYou might use this to fill in runs from a time period when the Schedule was paused due to an external condition that's now resolved, or a period before the Schedule was created.\n\n### Limit number of Actions\n\nA Schedule can be limited to a certain number of scheduled Actions (that is, not trigger immediately).\nAfter that it will act as if it were paused.\n\n### Policies\n\nA Schedule supports a set of Policies that enable customizing behavior.\n\n#### Overlap Policy\n\nThe Overlap Policy controls what happens when it is time to start a Workflow Execution but a previously started Workflow Execution is still running.\nThe following options are available:\n\n- `Skip`: **Default**.\n  Nothing happens; the Workflow Execution is not started.\n- `BufferOne`: Starts the Workflow Execution as soon as the current one completes.\n  The buffer is limited to one.\n  If another Workflow Execution is supposed to start, but one is already in the buffer, only the one in the buffer eventually starts.\n- `BufferAll`: Allows an unlimited number of Workflows to buffer.\n  They are started sequentially.\n- `CancelOther`: Cancels the running Workflow Execution, and then starts the new one after the old one completes cancellation.\n- `TerminateOther`: Terminates the running Workflow Execution and starts the new one immediately.\n- `AllowAll` Starts any number of concurrent Workflow Executions.\n  With this policy (and only this policy), more than one Workflow Execution, started by the Schedule, can run simultaneously.\n\n#### Catchup Window\n\nThe Temporal Cluster might be down or unavailable at the time when a Schedule should take an Action.\nWhen it comes back up, the Catchup Window controls which missed Actions should be taken at that point.\nThe default is one minute, which means that the Schedule attempts to take any Actions that wouldn't be more than one minute late.\nAn outage that lasts longer than the Catchup Window could lead to missed Actions.\n(But you can always [Backfill](#backfill).)\n\n#### Pause-on-failure\n\nIf this policy is set, a Workflow Execution started by a Schedule that ends with a failure or timeout (but not Cancellation or Termination) causes the Schedule to automatically pause.\n\nNote that with the `AllowAll` Overlap Policy, this pause might not apply to the next Workflow Execution, because the next Workflow Execution might have started before the failed one finished.\nIt applies only to Workflow Executions that were scheduled to start after the failed one finished.\n\n### Last completion result\n\nA Workflow started by a Schedule can obtain the completion result from the most recent successful run.\n(How you do this depends on the SDK you're using.)\n\nFor overlap policies that don't allow overlap, “the most recent successful run” is straightforward to define.\nFor the `AllowAll` policy, it refers to the run that completed most recently, at the time that the run in question is started.\nConsider the following overlapping runs:\n\n```\ntime -------------------------------------------->\n A     |----------------------|\n B               |-------|\n C                          |---------------|\n D                                |--------------T\n```\n\nIf D asks for the last completion result at time T, it gets the result of A.\nNot B, even though B started more recently, because A completed later.\nAnd not C, even though C completed after A, because the result for D is captured when D is started, not when it's queried.\n\nFailures and timeouts do not affect the last completion result.\n\n### Last failure\n\nA Workflow started by a Schedule can obtain the details of the failure of the most recent run that ended at the time when the Workflow in question was started. Unlike last completion result, a _successful_ run _does_ reset the last failure.\n\n### Limitations\n\nInternally, a Schedule is implemented as a Workflow.\nIf you're using Advanced Visibility (Elasticsearch), these Workflow Executions are hidden from normal views.\nIf you're using Standard Visibility, they are visible, though there's no need to interact with them directly.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"concepts/what-is-a-state-transition","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-state-transition.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-state-transition.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-state-transition","title":"What is a State Transition?","description":"A State Transition is a unit of progress by a Workflow Execution.","label":"State Transition","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA State Transition is a unit of progress made by a [Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution).\nEach State Transition is recorded in a persistence store.\n\nSome operations, such as [Activity Heartbeats](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-heartbeat), require only one State Transition each.\nMost operations require multiple State Transitions.\nFor example, a simple Workflow with two sequential [Activity Tasks](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task) (and no retries) produces 11 State Transitions: two for Workflow start, four for each Activity, and one for Workflow completion.\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"concepts","guide_id":"workflows","slug":"/workflows","local_ref":"","node_id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow","node_title":"What is a Workflow?","node_description":"In day-to-day conversations, the term \"Workflow\" frequently denotes either a Workflow Type, a Workflow Definition, or a Workflow Execution."},{"file_dir":"concepts","guide_id":"workflows","slug":"/workflows","local_ref":"workflow-definition","node_id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition","node_title":"What is a Workflow Definition?","node_description":"A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution."},{"file_dir":"concepts","guide_id":"workflows","slug":"/workflows","local_ref":"workflow-type","node_id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type","node_title":"What is a Workflow Type?","node_description":"A Workflow Type is a name that maps to a Workflow Definition."},{"file_dir":"concepts","guide_id":"workflows","slug":"/workflows","local_ref":"workflow-execution","node_id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution","node_title":"What is a Workflow Execution?","node_description":"A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution.

Pricing is flexible, transparent, and predictable, so you know your costs and never pay for unused capacity.\n\nThis page introduces the elements of Temporal Cloud pricing so that you can estimate costs for your implementation. To gain a reliable estimate, [contact our team](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us).\n\n## Temporal Actions\n\nActions are the fundamental consumption pricing unit in Temporal Cloud. An Action in Temporal occurs as part of an execution of your Workflow. Each time you execute a Temporal Workflow (a Workflow Execution), the associated Actions are collected and ultimately represent the state and progress of your Temporal Application.\n\nFor a deeper description of Actions, see [Action](/cloud#action). You can also [reach out to our team](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us) to get more information or to help size your number of Actions.\n\nActions are collected and billed monthly for each Namespace. The base rate is $25 per one million Actions, and you are billed only for the prorated amount of Actions you use. If you use fewer than one million Actions per month, your bill for Actions will be less than $25 for that month.\n\n| **Actions per month** | **Cost per 1M (USD)** |\n| --------------------- | --------------------- |\n| Any number            | $25.00 (prorated)     |\n\nAlternatively, Temporal also offers a credit system. Credits provide an additional discount schedule for both billable Actions and storage. Credits do not expire. The following table outlines cost estimates and discount bands for the credits system. Please reach out to the team if you are interested in this option.\n\n| **Actions per month (millions)** | **Cost per 1M (USD)** | **Cost band**       | **Actions per second** |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| 0 to 299                         | $23.25                | $0–$7,500           | ~115                   |\n| 300 to 1,499                     | $18.80                | $5,640–$28,200      | ~570                   |\n| 1,500 to 7,499                   | $14.10                | $21,150–$105,750    | ~2,860                 |\n| 7,500 to 29,999                  | $10.50                | $78,750–$315,000    | ~11,400                |\n| 30,000 to 149,999                | $7.90                 | $237,000–$1,185,000 | ~57,000                |\n| 150,000 or more                  | $5.90                 | Begins at $885,000  | n/a                    |\n\n## Storage\n\nAn execution of a particular Workflow could exist for a few seconds, a day, month, or even forever. Temporal collects the Event History during this time and dispatches work when necessary. In this context, a Workflow Execution has only two states, open (active) or closed.\n\nStorage costs are measured in gigabyte-hours (GBh) and include charges for active Workflows, \"running\" storage, and the long-term, \"retained\" storage of Event Histories of closed Workflows. These are measured per Namespace.\n\nRunning storage is a measure of the amount of storage used to store active Workflows. When the execution of a Workflow ends, Temporal Cloud stores Event History for a defined Retention Period, for historical use. This is retained storage. Typical uses include compliance, debugging, workload refresh, and business analytics. Both kinds of storage have fixed costs.\n\n| **Storage** | **Cost per GBh** |\n| ----------- | ---------------- |\n| Retained    | $0.00042         |\n| Running     | $0.042           |\n\nIf you purchase Temporal Cloud credits (as outlined earlier), running storage costs are tiered and measured in gigabyte-hours.\n\n| **Running storage** | **Cost per GBh** |\n| ------------------- | ---------------- |\n| Less than 10        | $0.042           |\n| 10 to 39            | $0.031           |\n| 40 to 119           | $0.023           |\n| 120 to 499          | $0.018           |\n| 500 to 1999         | $0.013           |\n| 2000 or more        | $0.010           |\n\n## Support\n\nWith a subscription to Temporal Cloud, you also gain access to our support organization of developer success engineers and solution architects. Our experts assist with a range of work streams from Workflow design reviews to setting up observability to break/fix support with an agreed-upon set of SLAs.\n\nThe members of the Temporal Developer Success team are engineers who are Temporal experts and open source contributors. They're backed by the main contributors to the open source Temporal project. They provide deep knowledge of how Temporal works and how you can optimize your deployment.\n\nThey also investigate your Workflows to optimize their environments and possibly reduce costs associated with Actions and storage. They ensure your instance is performance tuned and help with other ongoing maintenance, like upgrades of the Temporal software and maintenance of the platform.\n\nIf an issue occurs, the team provides support through our [support portal](/cloud/how-to-create-a-ticket-for-temporal-support), [community forum](https://community.temporal.io/), and (with Premium support) a dedicated Slack channel. Temporal offers two levels of support defined by their availability and SLAs.\n\n|                     | **Basic**                                                                                   | **Premium**                                                                            |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Response times      | P0: 1 business hour<br/>P1: 4 business hours<br/>P2: 1 business day<br/>P3: 2 business days | P0: 30 minutes<br/>P1: 1 business hour<br/>P2: 4 business hours<br/>P3: 1 business day |\n| Pricing (per month) | Greater of $200 or 10% monthly usage                                                        | Greater of $2,000 or 10% monthly activity                                              |\n\nBusiness hours for Temporal Support are 0500–1700 Monday–Friday (Pacific Time).\nFor P0 issues, coverage is 24×7.\n\n## SSO and SAML\n\nWe offer single sign-on (SSO) integration using SAML at a monthly fixed fee based on the number of users registered in Temporal Cloud:\n\n| **Users** | **Cost per month** |\n| --------- | ------------------ |\n| 0 to 25   | $200               |\n| 26 to 50  | $300               |\n| 51+       | $500               |\n\n## Pricing estimates\n\nTemporal Cloud employs a consumption-based pricing model that's based on storage and execution, factors that vary from one Workflow to the next. You can estimate the cost of a specific Workflow by running it at a low volume and then using its storage and compute measurements to project your production-scale cost. Our team is happy to [help you estimate the cost](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us) for your specific workloads.\n\n## Temporal pricing FAQ\n\nQ: What’s the minimum cost to run Temporal Cloud?\n\nA: The Temporal Cloud service is consumption based. You pay only for what you need with no minimum. Basic support has a minimum monthly fee of $200 per month.\n\nQ: How do I pay for Temporal Cloud?\n\nA: Temporal sends a monthly bill based on your consumption. You can pay this bill with a credit card, ACH, wire transfer, or Temporal Credits.\n\nQ: Can I purchase Temporal Cloud through my Amazon, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform marketplace?\n\nA: You can purchase Temporal Cloud credits in the AWS Marketplace.

Temporal CLI is a command-line tool that includes a distribution of a Temporal Cluster ([Temporal Server](/concepts/what-is-the-temporal-server), persistence (SQLite), and the [Temporal Web UI](/concepts/what-is-the-temporal-web-ui)).\n\n### Available commands\n\n- [temporal activity](/cli/activity/)\n- [temporal batch](/cli/batch/)\n- [temporal env](/cli/env/)\n- [temporal operator](/cli/operator/)\n- [temporal schedule](/cli/schedule/)\n- [temporal server](/cli/server)\n- [temporal task-queue](/cli/task-queue/)\n- [temporal workflow](/cli/workflow/)\n\n## Installation\n\n### cURL\n\n`curl -sSf https://temporal.download/cli.sh | sh`\n\n### Homebrew\n\n`brew install temporal`\n\n### Manual\n\n1. Download the version for your OS and architecture:\n   - [Linux amd64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=amd64)\n   - [Linux arm64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=arm64)\n   - [macOS amd64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=darwin&arch=amd64)\n   - [macOS arm64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=darwin&arch=arm64) (Apple silicon)\n   - [Windows amd64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=amd64)\n   - [Windows arm64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=arm64)\n2. Extract the downloaded archive.\n3. Add the `temporal` binary to your PATH. (`temporal.exe` for Windows)\n\n## Starting the Temporal Server\n\nRun the following command to start the Temporal Server.\nThis command also starts the Web UI.\n\n```bash\ntemporal server start-dev\n```\n\nAt this point you should have a server running on `localhost:7233` and a web interface at <http://localhost:8233>.\n\nBy default, it doesn’t persist your data—if you start a Workflow, Ctrl-C, and run the command again, your Workflow will be gone.\n\nIf you'd like your Workflows to be saved, use the `--db-filename` flag:\n\n```bash\ntemporal server start-dev --db-filename temporal.db\n```\n\n## Interacting with the Server\n\nIn another terminal, you can run commands to interact with the Server. This command starts a Workflow:\n\n```bash\n$ temporal workflow start \\\n  --task-queue hello-world \\\n  --type MyWorkflow \\\n  --workflow-id 123 \\\n  --input 456\n\nRunning execution:\n  WorkflowId                                   123\n  RunId       357074e4-0dd8-4c44-8367-d92536dd0943\n  Type        MyWorkflow\n  Namespace   default\n  TaskQueue   hello-world\n  Args        [456]\n```\n\nThe shorthand options are:\n\n```bash\ntemporal workflow start -t hello-world --type MyWorkflow -w 123 -i 456\n```\n\nYou can also list and describe Workflows:\n\n```bash\n$ temporal workflow list\n\n  Status   WorkflowId     Name       StartTime\n  Running         123  MyWorkflow  14 seconds ago\n\n$ temporal workflow describe --workflow-id 123\n\n{\n  \"executionConfig\": {\n    \"taskQueue\": {\n      \"name\": \"hello-world\",\n      \"kind\": \"Normal\"\n    },\n    \"workflowExecutionTimeout\": \"0s\",\n    \"workflowRunTimeout\": \"0s\",\n    \"defaultWorkflowTaskTimeout\": \"10s\"\n  },\n  \"workflowExecutionInfo\": {\n    \"execution\": {\n      \"workflowId\": \"123\",\n      \"runId\": \"357074e4-0dd8-4c44-8367-d92536dd0943\"\n    },\n    \"type\": {\n      \"name\": \"MyWorkflow\"\n    },\n    \"startTime\": \"2023-04-15T06:42:31.191137Z\",\n    \"status\": \"Running\",\n    \"historyLength\": \"2\",\n    \"executionTime\": \"2023-04-15T06:42:31.191137Z\",\n    \"memo\": {\n\n    },\n    \"autoResetPoints\": {\n\n    },\n    \"stateTransitionCount\": \"1\"\n  },\n  \"pendingWorkflowTask\": {\n    \"state\": \"Scheduled\",\n    \"scheduledTime\": \"2023-04-15T06:42:31.191173Z\",\n    \"originalScheduledTime\": \"2023-04-15T06:42:31.191173Z\",\n    \"attempt\": 1\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen listing, you can get more Workflow fields and output in JSON:\n\n```bash\n$ temporal workflow list --fields long --output json\n\n[\n  {\n    \"execution\": {\n      \"workflow_id\": \"123\",\n      \"run_id\": \"357074e4-0dd8-4c44-8367-d92536dd0943\"\n    },\n    \"type\": {\n      \"name\": \"MyWorkflow\"\n    },\n    \"start_time\": \"2023-04-15T06:42:31.191137Z\",\n    \"status\": 1,\n    \"execution_time\": \"2023-04-15T06:42:31.191137Z\",\n    \"memo\": {},\n    \"task_queue\": \"hello-world\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nFilter out just the type with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):\n\n```bash\n$ temporal workflow list --fields long -o json | jq '.[].type.name'\n\n\"OtherWorkflow\"\n\"MyWorkflow\"\n\"MyWorkflow\"\n```\n\nAnd count how many Workflows of each type you have:\n\n```bash\n$ temporal workflow list --fields long -o json | jq '.[].type.name' | uniq -c\n\n   1 \"OtherWorkflow\"\n   2 \"MyWorkflow\"\n```\n\nTo see what else you can do to Workflows, run `temporal workflow` or visit [CLI ▶️ workflow](/cli/workflow).\n\nTo see the list of top-level commands, run `temporal` or visit [Available commands](#available-commands).\n\n## Environments\n\nSo far, the CLI has been talking to the Server at the default address, `localhost:7233`. To talk to another Server, like a production namespace on Temporal Cloud:\n\n1. Create an environment named `prod`.\n2. Pass `--env prod` to commands, like `temporal workflow list --env prod`.\n\nTo create a new environment, start setting its properties:\n\n```bash\ntemporal env set prod.namespace production.f45a2\ntemporal env set prod.address production.f45a2.tmprl.cloud:7233\ntemporal env set prod.tls-cert-path /temporal/certs/prod.pem\ntemporal env set prod.tls-key-path /temporal/certs/prod.key\n```\n\nCheck that you set them correctly:\n\n```bash\n$ temporal env get prod\n\n  address        production.f45a2.tmprl.cloud:7233\n  namespace      production.f45a2\n  tls-cert-path  /temporal/certs/prod.pem\n  tls-key-path   /temporal/certs/prod.key\n```\n\nIf they’re correct, then this shouldn’t log a connection error:\n\n```bash\n$ temporal workflow list --env prod\n```\n\nFor the full list of properties you can set, see the below options:\n\n```bash\n$ temporal env set -h\n\nOPTIONS:\n   Client Options:\n\n   --address value                          The host and port (formatted as host:port) for the Temporal Frontend Service. [$TEMPORAL_CLI_ADDRESS]\n   --codec-auth value                       Sets the authorization header on requests to the Codec Server. [$TEMPORAL_CLI_CODEC_AUTH]\n   --codec-endpoint value                   Endpoint for a remote Codec Server. [$TEMPORAL_CLI_CODEC_ENDPOINT]\n   --context-timeout value                  An optional timeout for the context of an RPC call (in seconds). (default: 5) [$TEMPORAL_CONTEXT_TIMEOUT]\n   --env value                              Name of the environment to read environmental variables from. (default: \"default\")\n   --grpc-meta value [ --grpc-meta value ]  Contains gRPC metadata to send with requests (format: key=value). Values must be in a valid JSON format.\n   --namespace value, -n value              Identifies a Namespace in the Temporal Workflow. (default: \"default\") [$TEMPORAL_CLI_NAMESPACE]\n   --tls-ca-path value                      Path to server CA certificate. [$TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_CA]\n   --tls-cert-path value                    Path to x509 certificate. [$TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_CERT]\n   --tls-disable-host-verification          Disables TLS host name verification if already enabled. (default: false) [$TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_DISABLE_HOST_VERIFICATION]\n   --tls-key-path value                     Path to private certificate key. [$TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_KEY]\n   --tls-server-name value                  Provides an override for the target TLS server name. [$TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_SERVER_NAME]\n\n   Display Options:\n\n   --color value  when to use color: auto, always, never. (default: \"auto\")\n```\n\nFor example, to set `--codec-endpoint`, you would do:\n\n```bash\n$ temporal env set prod.codec-endpoint localhost:3000\n```\n\n## Server configuration\n\nUse the help flag to see a full list of CLI options:\n\n```bash\ntemporal server start-dev --help\n```\n\n### Namespace registration\n\nNamespaces are pre-registered at startup so they're available to use immediately.\nTo customize the pre-registered namespaces, start the server with the following:\n\n```bash\ntemporal server start-dev --namespace foo --namespace bar\n```\n\nYou can also register Namespaces with the following command:\n\n```bash\ntemporal operator namespace create foo\n```\n\n### Enable or disable Temporal UI\n\nBy default, the Temporal UI is started with Temporal CLI. The UI can be disabled via a runtime flag:\n\n```bash\ntemporal server start-dev --headless\n```\n\n### Dynamic configuration\n\nAdvanced configuration of the Temporal CLI requires the use of a dynamic configuration file.\nThis file is created outside the Temporal CLI; it is usually located with the service's config files.\n\nDynamic configuration values can also be set via `--dynamic-config-value KEY=JSON_VALUE`.\nFor example, to enable the Search Attribute cache (disabled by default), run the following:\n\n```bash\ntemporal server start-dev --dynamic-config-value system.forceSearchAttributesCacheRefreshOnRead=false\n```\n\nThis setting makes created Search Attributes immediately available for use.\n\n## Environmental variables\n\nThe Temporal CLI hosts a set of Client Options that can be used to configure the system environment.\nUse the following table as a reference for the Temporal CLI environmental variables.\n\n| Variable                                     | Definition                                                                        | Client Option                   |\n| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| `TEMPORAL_CLI_ADDRESS`                       | The host and port (formatted as host:port) for the Temporal Frontend Service.     | --address                       |\n| `TEMPORAL_CLI_CODEC_AUTH`                    | Sets the authorization header on requests to the Codec Server.                    | --codec-auth                    |\n| `TEMPORAL_CLI_CODEC_ENDPOINT`                | Endpoint for a remote Codec Server.                                               | --codec-endpoint                |\n| `TEMPORAL_CONTEXT_TIMEOUT`                   | An optional timeout for the context of an RPC call (in seconds). Default value: 5 | --context-timeout               |\n| `TEMPORAL_CLI_NAMESPACE`                     | Identifies a Namespace in the Temporal Workflow. Default value: \"default\".        | --namespace                     |\n| `TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_CA`                        | Path to server CA certificate.                                                    | --tls-ca-path                   |\n| `TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_CERT`                      | Path to x509 certificate.                                                         | --tls-cert-path                 |\n| `TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_DISABLE_HOST_VERIFICATION` | Disables TLS host name verification if already enabled. Default value: false.     | --tls-disable-host-verification |\n| `TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_KEY`                       | Path to private certificate key.                                                  | --tls-key-path                  |\n| `TEMPORAL_CLI_TLS_SERVER_NAME`               | Provides an override for the target TLS server name.                              | --tls-server-name               |\n\n## Auto-completion\n\nThe Temporal CLI has the capability to auto-complete commands.\n\nRunning `temporal completion SHELL` outputs the related completion SHELL code.\n\n### zsh auto-completion\n\n<!-- TODO: add more information about zsh to make comparable to bash section -->\n\nAdd the following code snippet to your `~/.zshrc` file:\n\n```sh\nsource <(temporal completion zsh)\n```\n\nIf you're running auto-completion from the terminal, run the following command:\n\n```sh\necho 'source <(temporal completion zsh)' >> ~/.zshrc\n```\n\nAfter setting the variable, run the following command:\n\n`source ~/.zshrc`.\n\n### Bash auto-completion\n\nBash auto-completion relies on `bash-completion`.\n\nInstall the software with the steps provided in the [bash-completion README](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion#installation), or use your preferred package manager on your operating system.\n\nFor more information, see [the Bash Completion page on Repology](https://repology.org/project/bash-completion/versions).\n\n### Aliases\n\nYou can also add aliases to your `~/.bash_profile` such as:\n\n```bash\nalias t='temporal'\nalias tw='temporal workflow'\nalias ts='temporal server start-dev'\nalias tsdb='temporal server start-dev --db-filename ~/temporal.db'\n\n# send process to background so you can continue using the terminal\nalias tsbg='temporal server start-dev &> /dev/null & disown'\n```\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"cli","guide_id":"index","slug":"none","local_ref":"","node_id":"concepts/what-is-the-temporal-cli","node_title":"What is the Temporal

are reflected in Temporal Web.\n- Worker errors and logs are reflected in the terminal.\n\nIf something isn't behaving the way you expect, make sure to check both locations for helpful error messages.\n\n### Stale Workflows\n\nIf you are developing Workflows and finding that code isn't executing as expected, the first place to look is whether old Workflows are still running.\n\nIf those old Workflows have the same name and are on the same task queue, Temporal will try to continue executing them on your new code by design.\nYou may get errors that make no sense to you because\n\n- Temporal is trying to execute old Workflow code that no longer exists in your codebase, or\n- your new Client code is expecting Temporal to execute old Workflow/Activity code it doesn't yet know about.\n\nThe biggest sign that this is happening is if you notice Temporal is acting non-deterministically: running the same Workflow twice gets different results.\n\nStale workflows are usually a non-issue because the errors generated are just noise from code you no longer want to run.\nIf you need to terminate old stale Workflows, you can do so with Temporal Web or `tctl`.\n\n### Workflow/Activity registration errors\n\n**If your Workflows or Activities are not imported or spelled correctly**, here are some errors we've seen:\n\n- `ApplicationFailure: 'MyFunction' is not a function`\n- `Workflow did not register a handler for MyQuery`\n\nDouble check that your Workers are registering the right Workflow and Activity Definitions (function names) on the right Task Queues.\n\n**If you are running Temporal in a monorepo**, then your `node_modules` may be in a different location than where Temporal expects to find it by default, which results in errors like:\n\n```bash\n[ERROR] Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@temporalio/workflow/lib/worker-interface.js' in '/src'\n```\n\nOur [Next.js tutorial](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/typescript/nextjs) is written for people setting up Temporal **within an existing monorepo**, which may be of use here.\n\nWhen you pass a `workflowsPath`, our Webpack config expects to find `node_modules` in the same or a parent/ancestor directory.\n\n**If you are custom bundling your own Workflows** you may get errors like these:\n\n```bash\n[ERROR] Failed to activate workflow {\n  runId: 'aaf84a83-51ce-462a-9ab7-6a641a703bff',\n  error: ReferenceError: exports is not defined,\n  workflowExists: false\n}\n```\n\nTemporal Workflow Bundles need to [export a set of methods that fit the compiled `worker-interface.ts` from `@temporalio/workflow`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/eaa2d205c9bc5ff4a3b17c0b34f2dcf6b1e0264a/packages/worker/src/workflow/bundler.ts#L81) as an entry point.\nWe do offer a `bundleWorkflowCode` method to assist you with this, though it uses our Webpack settings.\nFor more information, see the [Register types](dev-guide/typescript/foundations#register-types) section.\n\n### Webpack errors\n\nThe TypeScript SDK's Worker bundles Workflows based on `workflowsPath` with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and run them inside v8 isolates.\n\nIf Webpack fails to create the bundle, the SDK will throw an error and emit webpack logs using the SDK's [logger](/typescript/observability#logging).\n\nIf you do not see Webpack output in your terminal make sure that you have not disabled SDK logging (see reference to `Runtime.install()` in the link above).\n\n**A common mistake for newcomers to the TypeScript SDK is trying to use Node.js built-ins and modules in their Workflow code.** Usually, the best thing to do is move that code to an Activity.\n\nSome common examples that will **not** work in the Workflow isolate:\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nImporting node built-in modules\n</summary>\n\n:::danger Antipattern\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\n\nconst config = fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf8');\n```\n\n:::\n\nThis is invalid because reading from the filesystem is a non-deterministic operation: the file may change from the time of the original Workflow Execution to when the Workflow is replayed.\n\nYou'll typically see an error in this form in the Webpack output:\n\n```\n2021-10-14T19:22:00.606Z [INFO] Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'fs' in '/Users/you/your-project/src'\n2021-10-14T19:22:00.606Z [INFO] resolve 'fs' in

path: ./src)\n2021-10-14T19:22:00.606Z [INFO]     Field 'browser' doesn't contain a valid alias configuration\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nImporting and calling Activities directly from Workflow code\n</summary>\n\n:::danger Antipattern\n\n```ts\nimport { makeHTTPRequest } from './activities';\n\nexport async function yourWorkflow(): Promise<string> {\n  return await makeHTTPRequest('https://temporal.io');\n}\n```\n\n:::\n\nThis is invalid because activity implementations should not be directly referenced by Workflow code.\nActivities are used by Workflows in order make network calls and reading from the filesystem, operations which are non-deterministic by nature because they rely on external state.\nTemporal records Activity results in the Workflow history and in case your Workflow is replayed, completed Activities will not be rerun, instead their recorded result will be delivered to the Workflow.\n\nYou'll typically see an error in this form in the Webpack output:\n\n```\n2021-10-14T19:46:52.731Z [INFO] ERROR in ./src/activities.ts 8:31-46\n2021-10-14T19:46:52.731Z [INFO] Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'http' in

Turn it off and it should work.\n\nimport Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\nimport TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n\n<Tabs\ndefaultValue=\"webpackterser\"\nvalues={[\n{label: 'Webpack with Terser', value: 'webpackterser'},\n{label: 'ESbuild', value: 'esbuild'},\n]\n}>\n\n<TabItem value=\"webpackterser\">\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  optimization: {\n    minimize: true,\n    minimizer: [\n      new TerserPlugin({\n        terserOptions: {\n          keep_fnames: true, // don't strip funciton names in production\n        },\n      }),\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value=\"esbuild\">\n\n```js\nrequire('esbuild').buildSync({\n  entryPoints: ['app.js'],\n  minify: true,\n  keepNames: true,\n  outfile: 'out.js',\n});\n```\n\nSee esbuild docs: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#keep-names\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\n#### Connecting to Temporal Server\n\nIf you are trying to connect in production and getting this:\n\n```bash\n[TransportError: transport error]\n```\n\nIt is a sign that something is wrong with your Cert/Key pair.\nLog it out and make sure it is an exact match with what is expected (often, the issue can be whitespace when injecting from your production secrets management environment).\n\n### Resetting Workflows to deal with logical bugs\n\nYou can \"rewind time\" using the `tctl` CLI, resetting Workflow History to some previous point in time. You can read the CLI docs on:\n\n- [Restarting and resetting Workflows by ID](/tctl-v1)\n- [Resetting all Workflows by binary checksum identifier](/tctl-v1)\n\nIf you need to reset programmatically, the TS SDK does not have any high level APIs for this, but you can make raw gRPC calls to [resetWorkflowExecution](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/proto.temporal.api.workflowservice.v1.workflowservice-1/#resetworkflowexecution).\n\nResetting should only be used to deal with serious logical bugs in your code: it's not for handling transient failures, like a downstream service being unreachable. It should not be used in the course of normal application flows.\n\n### gRPC call timeouts (context deadline exceeded)\n\nThe opaque `context deadline exceeded` error comes from `gRPC`:\n\n```\nError:

conditions can cause this error, including network hiccups, timeouts that are too short, and an overloaded server.\nQuerying a Workflow Execution whose query handler causes an error can result in the query call timing out.\n\nSome troubleshooting actions you can take:\n\n- Verify the connection from your Worker to the Temporal Server is working and doesn't have unusually high latency.\n- If you are running Temporal Server yourself, check your [server metrics](/kb/legacy-oss-prod-deploy/#scaling-and-metrics) to ensure it's not overloaded.\n- If what's timing out is a query, check the logs of your Workers to see if they are having issues handling the query.\n\nIf none of the preceding actions help you discover why timeouts are occurring, please try to produce a minimal repro and we'll be glad to help.\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"dev-guide/tscript","guide_id":"debugging","slug":"/dev-guide/typescript/debugging","local_ref":"","node_id":"typescript/debugging","node_title":"Debugging","node_description":"Debug

dynamically\n\nFor more flexible use cases, you might want a dynamic Signal (such as a generated ID).\nYou can handle it in two ways:\n\n- Avoid making it dynamic by collapsing all Signals into one handler and move the ID to the payload.\n- Actually make the Signal name dynamic by inlining the Signal definition per handler.\n\n```ts\nimport * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\n// \"fat handler\" solution\nwf.setHandler(`genericSignal`, (payload) => {\n  switch (payload.taskId) {\n    case taskAId:\n      // do task A things\n      break;\n    case taskBId:\n      // do task B things\n      break;\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Unexpected task.');\n  }\n});\n\n// \"inline definition\" solution\nwf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(`task-${taskAId}`), (payload) => {\n  /* do task A things */\n});\nwf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(`task-${taskBId}`), (payload) => {\n  /* do task B things */\n});\n\n// utility \"inline definition\" helper\nconst inlineSignal = (signalName, handler) =>\n  wf.setHandler(wf.defineSignal(signalName), handler);\ninlineSignal(`task-${taskBId}`, (payload) => {\n  /* do task B things */\n});\n```\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    API Design FAQs\n  </summary>\n\n**Why not \"new Signal\" and \"new Query\"?**\n\nThe semantic of `defineSignal` and `defineQuery` is intentional.\nThey return Signal and Query **definitions**, not unique instances of Signals and Queries themselves\nThe following is their [entire source code](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/fc658d3760e6653aec47732ab17a0062b7dd23fc/packages/workflow/src/workflow.ts#L883-L907):\n\n```ts\n/**\n * Define a signal method for a Workflow.\n */\nexport function defineSignal<Args extends any[] = []>(\n  name: string,\n): SignalDefinition<Args> {\n  return {\n    type: 'signal',\n    name,\n  };\n}\n\n/**\n * Define a query method for a Workflow.\n */\nexport function defineQuery<Ret, Args extends any[] = []>(\n  name: string,\n): QueryDefinition<Ret, Args> {\n  return {\n    type: 'query',\n    name,\n  };\n}\n```\n\nSignals and Queries are instantiated only in `setHandler` and are specific to particular Workflow Executions.\n\nThese distinctions might seem minor, but they model how Temporal works under the hood, because Signals and Queries are messages identified by \"just strings\" and don't have meaning independent of the Workflow having a listener to handle them.\nThis will be clearer if you refer to the Client-side APIs.\n\n**Why setHandler and not OTHER_API?**\n\nWe named it `setHandler` instead of `subscribe` because a Signal or Query can have only one \"handler\" at a time, whereas `subscribe` could imply an Observable with multiple consumers and is a higher-level construct.\n\n```ts\nwf.setHandler(MySignal, handlerFn1);\nwf.setHandler(MySignal, handlerFn2); // replaces handlerFn1\n```\n\nIf you are familiar with [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), you are free to wrap your Signals and Queries into Observables if you want, or you could dynamically reassign the listener based on your business logic or Workflow state.\n\n</details>\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"typescript/workflow-timeouts","node":{"file_name":"workflow-timeouts.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/typescript/workflow-timeouts.md","id":"typescript/workflow-timeouts","title":"Workflow

to implement interceptors in TypeScript","description":"Interceptors are a mechanism for modifying inbound and outbound SDK calls, commonly used to add tracing and authorization.","label":"Interceptors","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nInterceptors are a mechanism for modifying inbound and outbound SDK calls.\nInterceptors are commonly used to add tracing and authorization to the scheduling and execution of Workflows and Activities.\nYou can compare these to \"middleware\" in other frameworks.\n\nThe TypeScript SDK comes with an optional interceptor package that adds tracing with [OpenTelemetry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@temporalio/interceptors-opentelemetry).\nSee how to use it in the [interceptors-opentelemetry](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/interceptors-opentelemetry) code sample.\n\n### Interceptor types\n\n- [WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor/): Intercept Workflow inbound calls like execution, Signals, and Queries.\n- [WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor/): Intercept Workflow outbound calls to Temporal APIs like scheduling Activities and starting Timers.\n- [ActivityInboundCallsInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.ActivityInboundCallsInterceptor): Intercept inbound calls to an Activity (such as `execute`).\n- [WorkflowClientCallsInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowClientCallsInterceptor/): Intercept methods of [`WorkflowClient`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowClient/) and [`WorkflowHandle`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowHandle) like starting or signaling a Workflow.\n\n### How interceptors work\n\nInterceptors are run in a chain, and all interceptors work similarly.\nThey accept two arguments: `input` and `next`, where `next` calls the next interceptor in the chain.\nAll interceptor methods are optional—it's up to the implementor to choose which methods to intercept.\n\n### Interceptor examples\n\n<!--TODO use snipsync-->\n\n**Log start and completion of Activities**\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  ActivityInput,\n  Next,\n  WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor,\n} from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport class ActivityLogInterceptor\n  implements WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor\n{\n  constructor(public readonly workflowType: string) {}\n\n  async scheduleActivity(\n    input: ActivityInput,\n    next: Next<WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor, 'scheduleActivity'>,\n  ): Promise<unknown> {\n    console.log('Starting activity', { activityType: input.activityType });\n    try {\n      return await next(input);\n    } finally {\n      console.log('Completed activity', {\n        workflow: this.workflowType,\n        activityType: input.activityType,\n      });\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Authorization**\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  defaultDataConverter,\n  Next,\n  WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor,\n  WorkflowInput,\n} from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\n/**\n * WARNING: This demo is meant as a simple auth example.\n * Do not use this for actual authorization logic.\n * Auth headers should be encrypted and credentials\n * stored outside of the codebase.\n */\nexport class DumbWorkflowAuthInterceptor\n  implements WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor\n{\n  public async execute(\n    input: WorkflowInput,\n    next: Next<WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor, 'execute'>,\n  ): Promise<unknown> {\n    const authHeader = input.headers.auth;\n    const { user, password } = authHeader\n      ? await defaultDataConverter.fromPayload(authHeader)\n      : undefined;\n\n    if (!(user === 'admin' && password === 'admin')) {\n      throw new Error('Unauthorized');\n    }\n    return await next(input);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo properly do authorization from Workflow code, the Workflow would need to access encryption keys and possibly authenticate against an external user database, which requires the Workflow to break isolation.\nPlease contact us if you need to discuss this further.\n\n### Interceptor registration\n\n**Activity and client interceptors registration**\n\n- Activity interceptors are registered on Worker creation by passing an array of [ActivityInboundCallsInterceptor factory functions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.ActivityInboundCallsInterceptorFactory) through [WorkerOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#interceptors).\n\n- Client interceptors are registered on `WorkflowClient` construction by passing an array of [WorkflowClientCallsInterceptor factory functions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowClientCallsInterceptorFactory) via [WorkflowClientOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowClientOptions#interceptors).\n\n**Workflow interceptors registration**\n\nWorkflow interceptor registration is different from the other interceptors because they run in the Workflow isolate.\nTo register Workflow interceptors, export an `interceptors` function from a file located in the `workflows` directory and provide the name of that file to the Worker on creation via [WorkerOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#interceptors).\n\nAt the time of construction, the Workflow context is already initialized for the current Workflow.\nUse [`workflowInfo`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#workflowinfo) to add Workflow-specific information in the interceptor.\n\n`src/workflows/your-interceptors.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { workflowInfo } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport const interceptors = () => ({\n  outbound: [new ActivityLogInterceptor(workflowInfo().workflowType)],\n  inbound: [],\n});\n```\n\n`src/worker/index.ts`\n\n```ts\nconst worker = await Worker.create({\n  workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),\n  interceptors: {\n    workflowModules: [require.resolve('./workflows/your-interceptors')],\n  },\n});\n```\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"dev-guide/tscript","guide_id":"features","slug":"/dev-guide/typescript/features","local_ref":"","node_id":"typescript/features","node_title":"How

is a helpful pattern for using closures to do the following:\n\n- Store expensive dependencies for sharing, such as database connections.\n- Inject secret keys (such as environment variables) from the Worker to the Activity.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART

`${mensaje}: ${name}`;\n  },\n});\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n<details>\n  <summary>See full example</summary>\n\nWhen you register these in the Worker, pass your shared dependencies accordingly:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-deps-worker {\"enable_source_link\": false}-->\n\n```ts\nimport { createActivities } from './activities';\n\nasync function run() {\n  // Mock DB connection initialization in Worker\n  const db = {\n    async get(_key: string) {\n      return 'Temporal';\n    },\n  };\n\n  const worker = await Worker.create({\n    taskQueue: 'dependency-injection',\n    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),\n    activities: createActivities(db),\n  });\n\n  await worker.run();\n}\n\nrun().catch((err) => {\n  console.error(err);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nBecause Activities are always referenced by name, inside the Workflow they can be proxied as normal, although the types need some adjustment:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-deps-workflow-->\n\n[activities-dependency-injection/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/activities-dependency-injection/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nimport

createActivities>\n>({\n  startToCloseTimeout: '30 seconds',\n});\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n</details>\n\n#### Import multiple Activities simultaneously\n\nYou can proxy multiple Activities from the same `proxyActivities` call if you want them to share the same timeouts, retries, and options:\n\n```ts\nexport async function Workflow(name: string): Promise<string> {\n  // destructuring multiple activities with the same options\n  const { act1, act2, act3 } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>();\n  /* activityOptions */\n  await act1();\n  await Promise.all([act2, act3]);\n}\n```\n\n#### Dynamically reference Activities\n\nBecause Activities are referenced only by their string names, you can reference them dynamically if needed:\n\n```js\nexport async function DynamicWorkflow(activityName, ...args) {\n  const acts = proxyActivities(/* activityOptions */);\n\n  // these are equivalent\n  await acts.activity1();\n  await acts['activity1']();\n\n  // dynamic reference to activities using activityName\n  let result = await acts[activityName](...args);\n}\n```\n\nType safety is still supported here, but we encourage you to validate and handle mismatches in Activity names.\nAn invalid Activity name leads to a `NotFoundError` with a message that looks like this:\n\n```\nApplicationFailure: Activity function actC is not registered on this Worker, available

\"actB\"]\n```\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"typescript/spawning-activities","node":{"file_name":"spawning-activities.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/typescript/spawning-activities.md","id":"typescript/spawning-activities","title":"How

to run a Worker on Docker in TypeScript","description":"Workers based on the TypeScript SDK can be deployed and run as Docker containers.","label":"Run a Worker on Docker","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","typescript"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nWorkers based on the TypeScript SDK can be deployed and run as Docker containers.\n\nAt this moment, we recommend using Node.js 18.\n(Node.js 20 has known issues.)\nBoth `amd64` and `arm64` platforms are supported.\nA glibc-based image is required; musl-based images are _not_ supported (see below).\n\nThe easiest way to deploy a TypeScript SDK Worker on Docker is to start with the `node:18-bullseye` image.\nFor example:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:18-bullseye\n\nCOPY . /app\nWORKDIR /app\n\nRUN npm install --only=production \\\n    && npm run build\n\nCMD [\"build/worker.js\"]\n```\n\nFor smaller images and/or more secure deployments, it is also possible to use `-slim` Docker image variants (like `node:18-bullseye-slim`) or `distroless/nodejs` Docker images (like `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:18`) with the following caveats.\n\n### Using `node:slim` images\n\n`node:slim` images do not contain some of the common packages found in regular images. This results in significantly smaller images.\n\nHowever, TypeScript SDK requires the presence of root TLS certificates (the `ca-certificates` package), which are not included in `slim` images.\nThe `ca-certificates` package is required even when connecting to a local Temporal Server or when using a server connection config that doesn't explicitly use TLS.\n\nFor this reason, the `ca-certificates` package must be installed during the construction of the Docker image.\nFor example:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:18-bulleyes-slim\n\nRUN apt-get update \\\n    && apt-get install -y ca-certificates \\\n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# ... same as with regular image\n```\n\nFailure to install this dependency results in a `[TransportError: transport error]` runtime error, because the certificates cannot be verified.\n\n### Using `distroless/nodejs` images\n\n`distroless/nodejs` images include only the files that are strictly required to execute `node`.\nThis results in even smaller images (approximately half the size of `node:slim` images).\nIt also significantly reduces the surface of potential security issues that could be exploited by a hacker in the resulting Docker images.\n\nIt is generally possible and safe to execute TypeScript SDK Workers using `distroless/nodejs` images (unless your code itself requires dependencies that are not included in `distroless/nodejs`).\n\nHowever, some tools required for the build process (notably the `npm` command) are _not_ included in the `distroless/nodejs` image.\nThis might result in various error messages during the Docker build.\n\nThe recommanded solution is to use a multi-step Dockerfile.\nFor example:\n\n```dockerfile\n# -- BUILD STEP --\n\nFROM node:18-bulleyes AS builder\n\nCOPY . /app\nWORKDIR /app\n\nRUN npm install --only=production \\\n    && npm run build\n\n# -- RESULTING IMAGE --\n\nFROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:18\n\nCOPY --from=builder /app /app\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCMD [\"build/worker.js\"]\n```\n\n### Properly configure Node.js memory in Docker\n\nBy default, `node` configures its maximum old-gen memory to 25% of the _physical memory_ of the machine on which it is executing, with a maximum of 4 GB.\nThis is likely inappropriate when running Node.js in a Docker environment and can result in either underusage of available memory (`node` only uses a fraction of the memory allocated to the container) or overusage (`node` tries to use more memory than what is allocated to the container, which will eventually lead to the process being killed by the operating system).\n\nTherefore we recommended that you always explicitly set the `--max-old-space-size` `node` argument to approximately 80% of the maximum size (in megabytes) that you want to allocate the `node` process.\nYou might need some experimentation and adjustment to find the most appropriate value based on your specific application.\n\nIn practice, it is generally easier to provide this argument through the [`NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_optionsoptions).\n\n### Do not use Alpine\n\nAlpine replaces glibc with musl, which is incompatible with the Rust core of the TypeScript SDK.\nIf you receive errors like the following, it's probably because you are using Alpine.\n\n```sh\nError: Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: No such file or directory (needed by /opt/app/node_modules/@temporalio/core-bridge/index.node)\n```\n\nOr like this:\n\n```sh\nError: Error relocating /opt/app/node_modules/@temporalio/core-bridge/index.node:

scopes in Typescript","label":"Cancellation scopes","tags":["developer-guide","typescript"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nIn the TypeScript SDK, Workflows are represented internally by a tree of cancellation scopes, each with cancellation behaviors you can specify.\nBy default, everything runs in the \"root\" scope.\n\nScopes are created using the [CancellationScope](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope) constructor or one of three static helpers:\n\n- [cancellable(fn)](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope#cancellable-1): Children are automatically cancelled when their containing scope is cancelled.\n  - Equivalent to `new CancellationScope().run(fn)`.\n- [nonCancellable(fn)](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope#noncancellable): Cancellation does not propagate to children.\n  - Equivalent to `new CancellationScope({ cancellable: false }).run(fn)`.\n- [withTimeout(timeoutMs, fn)](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope#withtimeout): If a timeout triggers before `fn` resolves, the scope is cancelled, triggering cancellation of any enclosed operations, such as Activities and Timers.\n  - Equivalent to `new CancellationScope({ cancellable: true, timeout: timeoutMs }).run(fn)`.\n\nCancellations are applied to cancellation scopes, which can encompass an entire Workflow or just part of one.\nScopes can be nested, and cancellation propagates from outer scopes to inner ones.\nA Workflow's `main` function runs in the outermost scope.\nCancellations are handled by catching `CancelledFailure`s thrown by cancelable operations.\n\n`CancellationScope.run()` and the static helpers mentioned earlier return native JavaScript promises, so you can use the familiar Promise APIs like `Promise.all` and `Promise.race` to model your asynchronous logic.\nYou can also use the following APIs:\n\n- `CancellationScope.current()`: Get the current scope.\n- `scope.cancel()`: Cancel all operations inside a `scope`.\n- `scope.run(fn)`: Run an async function within a `scope` and return the result of `fn`.\n- `scope.cancelRequested`: A promise that resolves when a scope cancellation is requested, such as when Workflow code calls `cancel()` or the entire Workflow is cancelled by an external client.\n\nWhen a `CancellationScope` is cancelled, it propagates cancellation in any child scopes and of any cancelable operations created within it, such as the following:\n\n- Activities\n- Timers (created with the [sleep](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#sleep) function)\n- [Triggers](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.Trigger)\n\n### CancelledFailure\n\nTimers and triggers throw [CancelledFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.CancelledFailure) when cancelled; Activities and Child Workflows throw `ActivityFailure` and `ChildWorkflowFailure` with cause set to `CancelledFailure`.\nOne exception is when an Activity or Child Workflow is scheduled in an already cancelled scope (or Workflow).\nIn this case, they propagate the `CancelledFailure` that was thrown to cancel the scope.\n\nTo simplify checking for cancellation, use the [isCancellation(err)](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#iscancellation) function.\n\n### Internal cancellation example\n\n<!--SNIPSTART

[`interceptors-opentelemetry`](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/interceptors-opentelemetry) sample shows how to use the SDK's built-in OpenTelemetry tracing to trace everything from starting a Workflow to Workflow Execution to running an Activity from that Workflow.\n\nThe built-in tracing uses protobuf message headers (like [this one](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/b2b8ae6592a8730dd5be6d90569d1aea84e1712f/temporal/api/workflowservice/v1/request_response.proto#L161) when starting a Workflow) to propagate the tracing information from the client to the Workflow and from the Workflow to its successors (when Continued As New), children, and Activities.\nAll of these executions are linked with a single trace identifier and have the proper `parent -> child` span relation.\n\nTracing is compatible between different Temporal SDKs as long as compatible [context propagators](https://opentelemetry.lightstep.com/core-concepts/context-propagation/) are used.\n\n**Context propagation**\n\nThe TypeScript SDK uses the global OpenTelemetry propagator.\n\nTo extend the default ([Trace Context](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/packages/opentelemetry-core/README.md#w3ctracecontextpropagator-propagator) and [Baggage](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/packages/opentelemetry-core/README.md#baggage-propagator) propagators) to also include the [Jaeger propagator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger), follow these steps:\n\n- `npm i @opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger`\n\n- At the top level of your Workflow code, add the following lines:\n\n  ```js\n  import { propagation } from '@opentelemetry/api';\n  import {\n    CompositePropagator,\n    W3CBaggagePropagator,\n    W3CTraceContextPropagator,\n  } from '@opentelemetry/core';\n  import { JaegerPropagator } from '@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger';\n\n  propagation.setGlobalPropagator(\n    new CompositePropagator({\n      propagators: [\n        new W3CTraceContextPropagator(),\n        new W3CBaggagePropagator(),\n        new JaegerPropagator(),\n      ],\n    }),\n  );\n  ```\n\nSimilarly, you can customize the OpenTelemetry `NodeSDK` propagators by following the instructions in the [Initialize the SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/experimental/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-node#initialize-the-sdk)

Workflows run in a sandboxed environment and cannot do any I/O.\n1. Workflow code might get replayed at any time, generating duplicate log messages.\n\nTo work around these limitations, we recommend using the sinks feature in the TypeScript SDK.\nSinks enable one-way export of logs, metrics, and traces from the Workflow isolate to the Node.js environment.\n\n<!--\nWorkflows in Temporal may be replayed from the beginning of their history when resumed. In order for Temporal to recreate the exact state Workflow code was in, the code is required to be fully deterministic. To prevent breaking determinism, in the TypeScript SDK, Workflow code runs in an isolated execution environment and may not use any of the Node.js APIs or communicate directly with the outside world. -->\n\nSinks are written as objects with methods.\nSimilar to Activities, they are declared in the Worker and then proxied in Workflow code, and it helps to share types between both.\n\n#### Comparing Sinks, Activities, and interceptors\n\nSinks are similar to Activities in that they are both registered on the Worker and proxied into the Workflow.\nHowever, they differ from Activities in important ways:\n\n- A sink function doesn't return any value back to the Workflow and cannot be awaited.\n- A sink call isn't recorded in the Event History of a Workflow Execution (no timeouts or retries).\n- A sink function _always_ runs on the same Worker that runs the Workflow Execution it's called from.\n\n#### Declare the sink interface\n\nExplicitly declaring a sink's interface is optional but is useful for ensuring type safety in subsequent steps:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-interface-->\n\n[sinks/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/sinks/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nimport { LoggerSinks, proxySinks, Sinks } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport interface AlertSinks extends Sinks {\n  alerter: {\n    alert(message: string): void;\n  };\n}\n\nexport type MySinks = AlertSinks & LoggerSinks;\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n#### Implement sinks\n\nImplementing sinks is a two-step process.\n\nImplement and inject the Sink function into a Worker\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-worker-->\n\n[sinks/src/worker.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/sinks/src/worker.ts)\n\n```ts\nimport { defaultSinks, InjectedSinks, Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';\nimport { MySinks } from './workflows';\n\nasync function main() {\n  const sinks: InjectedSinks<MySinks> = {\n    ...defaultSinks(),\n    alerter: {\n      alert: {\n        fn(workflowInfo, message) {\n          console.log(`sending SMS alert!\nworkflow: ${workflowInfo.runId}\nmessage: ${message}`);\n        },\n        callDuringReplay: false, // The default\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  const worker = await Worker.create({\n    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),\n    taskQueue: 'sinks',\n    sinks,\n  });\n  await worker.run();\n  console.log('Worker gracefully shutdown');\n}\n\nmain().catch((err) => {\n  console.error(err);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n- Sink function implementations are passed as an object into [WorkerOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions/#sinks).\n- You can specify whether you want the injected function to be called during Workflow replay by setting the `callDuringReplay` option.\n\n#### Proxy and call a sink function from a Workflow\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-workflow-->\n\n[sinks/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/sinks/src/workflows.ts)\n\n```ts\nconst { alerter, defaultWorkerLogger } = proxySinks<MySinks>();\n\nexport async function sinkWorkflow(): Promise<string> {\n  defaultWorkerLogger.info('default logger: Workflow Execution started', {});\n  alerter.alert('alerter: Workflow Execution started');\n  return 'Hello, Temporal!';\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nSome important features of the [InjectedSinkFunction](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.InjectedSinkFunction) interface:\n\n- **Injected WorkflowInfo argument**: The first argument of a Sink function implementation is a [`workflowInfo` object](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowInfo/) that contains useful metadata.\n- **Limited arguments types**: The remaining Sink function arguments are copied between the sandbox and the Node.js environment using the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm).\n- **No return value**: To prevent breaking determinism, Sink functions cannot return values to the Workflow.\n\n### Advanced: Performance considerations and non-blocking sinks\n\nThe injected sink function contributes to the overall Workflow Task processing duration.\n\n- If you have a long-running sink function, such as one that tries to communicate with external services, you might start seeing Workflow Task timeouts.\n- The effect is multiplied when using `callDuringReplay: true` and replaying long Workflow histories because the Workflow Task timer starts when the first history page is delivered to the Worker.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"typescript/custom-logging","node":{"file_name":"custom-logging.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/typescript/custom-logging.md","id":"typescript/custom-logging","title":"How

Workers and Clients\n\nThe Worker comes with a default logger, which defaults to log any messages with level `INFO` and higher to `STDERR` using `console.error`.\nThe following [log levels](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/worker#loglevel) are listed in increasing order of severity.\n\n#### Customizing the default logger\n\nTemporal uses a [`DefaultLogger`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.DefaultLogger/) that implements the basic interface:\n\n```ts\nimport { DefaultLogger, Runtime } from '@temporalio/worker';\n\nconst logger = new DefaultLogger('WARN', ({ level, message }) => {\n  console.log(`Custom logger: ${level} — ${message}`);\n});\nRuntime.install({ logger });\n```\n\nThe previous code example sets the default logger to log only messages with level `WARN` and higher.\n\n#### Accumulate logs for testing and reporting\n\n```ts\nimport { DefaultLogger, LogEntry } from '@temporalio/worker';\n\nconst logs: LogEntry[] = [];\nconst logger = new DefaultLogger('TRACE', (entry) => logs.push(entry));\nlog.debug('hey', { a: 1 });\nlog.info('ho');\nlog.warn('lets', { a: 1 });\nlog.error('go');\n```\n\nA common logging use case is logging to a file to be picked up by a collector like the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/nodejs/?tab=winston30).\n\n```ts\nimport { Runtime } from '@temporalio/worker';\nimport winston from 'winston';\n\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  level: 'info',\n  format: winston.format.json(),\n  transports: [new transports.File({ filename:

is incompatible with the History), [DeterminismViolationError](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.DeterminismViolationError) is thrown.\nIf replay fails for any other reason, [ReplayError](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.ReplayError) is thrown.\n\nIn the following example, a single Event History is loaded from a JSON file on disk (as obtained from the

client.workflow.getHandle('your-workflow-id');\nconst history = await handle.fetchHistory();\nawait Worker.runReplayHistory(\n  {\n    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./your/workflows'),\n  },\n

[non-deterministic behavior](/workflows#code-changes-can-cause-non-deterministic-behavior) in current long-running Workflows.\n\n<!-- The following was ported from \\docs-src\\typescript\\patching.md -->\n\n### Alternatives\n\nBefore you explore our patching/versioning API, check if your needs can be addressed in other ways:\n\n- [Version Task Queue](#version-task-queue)\n- [Version Workflow Name](#version-workflow-name)\n\nBoth options mean that Workflows running `v1` code will never migrate to `v2` code: they will run `v1` code to completion.\nIf you would like to update Workflows running `v1` _while they are still running_, you [may need to \"patch in\" code](#do-i-need-to-patch).\n\n#### Version Task Queue\n\nIf we're currently running our v1 Workflow code on Workers that poll on `queue1`, we can run v2 Workflow code on Workers that poll on `queue2`:\n\n1. Leave some Workers running your v1 `Workflow`, on the `queue1` Task Queue.\n1. Change your `Workflow` code and spin up new Workers that are polling a `queue2` Task Queue.\n1. Cut over your Clients to only call `Workflow` on `queue2` from now on.\n1. Remove your v1 Workers when all the v1 Workflows have completed.\n\n#### Version Workflow Name\n\nWhile versioning the Task Queue is usually easier, we can also create a new version of a Workflow by copying it and changing its name:\n\n1. Copy `Workflow1`'s code to a `Workflow2` function and change what you need.\n1. Register `Workflow2` in your Workers alongside `Workflow1`.\n1. Cut over your Clients to only call `Workflow2` from now on.\n1. Remove `Workflow1` code when none of them are running anymore.\n\n### Do I need to Patch?\n\nYou may need to patch if:\n\n- You want to change the remaining logic of a Workflow while it is still running\n- If your new logic can result in a different execution path\n\nThis added `sleep()` can result in a different execution path:\n\n```ts\n// from v1\nexport async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {\n  await runActivity();\n  return 7;\n}\n\n// to v2\nexport async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {\n  await sleep('1 day');\n\n  await runActivity();\n  return 7;\n}\n```\n\nIf v2 is deployed while there's a Workflow on the `runActivity` step, when the Activity completes, the Worker will try to replay the Workflow (in order to continue Workflow execution), notice that the sleep command is called and doesn't match with the Workflow's Event History, and throw a non-determinism error.\n\nAdding a Signal Handler for a Signal type that has never been sent before does not need patching:\n\n```ts\n// from v1\nexport async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {\n  await sleep('1 days');\n  return value;\n}\n\n// to v2\nconst updateValueSignal = defineSignal<[number]>('updateValue');\n\nexport async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {\n  setHandler(updateValueSignal, (newValue) => (value = newValue));\n\n  await sleep('1 days');\n  return value;\n}\n```\n\n### Migrating Workflows in Patches\n\nWorkflow code has to be [deterministic](/workflows#deterministic-constraints) by taking the same code path when replaying history events.\nAny Workflow code change that affects the order in which commands are generated breaks this assumption.\n\nSo we have to keep both the old and new code when migrating Workflows while they are still running:\n\n- When replaying, use the original code version that generated the ongoing event history.\n- When executing a new code path, always execute the\n  new code.\n\n<details>\n<summary>30 Min Video: Introduction to Versioning\n</summary>\n\nBecause we design for potentially long-running Workflows at scale, versioning with Temporal works differently than with other Workflow systems.\nWe explain more in this optional 30 minute introduction: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY)\n\n</details>\n\n### TypeScript SDK Patching API\n\nIn principle, the TypeScript SDK's patching mechanism works in a similar \"feature-flag\" fashion to the other SDK's, however, the \"versioning\" API has been updated to a notion of \"patching in\" code.\nThere are three steps to this reflecting three stages of migration:\n\n- Running v1 code with vFinal patched in concurrently\n- Running vFinal code with deprecation markers for vFinal patches\n- Running \"just\" vFinal code.\n\nThis is best explained in sequence (click through to follow along using our SDK sample).\n\nGiven an initial Workflow version `v1`:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-1-->\n\n[patching-api/src/workflows-v1.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/patching-api/src/workflows-v1.ts)\n\n```ts\n// v1\nexport async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {\n  await activityA();\n  await sleep('1 days'); // arbitrary long sleep to simulate a long running workflow we need to patch\n  await activityThatMustRunAfterA();\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\nWe decide to update our code and run `activityB` instead.\nThis is our desired end state, `vFinal`.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-final-->\n\n[patching-api/src/workflows-vFinal.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/patching-api/src/workflows-vFinal.ts)\n\n```ts\n// vFinal\nexport async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {\n  await activityB();\n  await sleep('1 days');\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n**Problem: We cannot directly deploy `vFinal` until we know for sure there are no more running Workflows created using `v1` code.**\n\nInstead we must deploy `v2` (below) and use the [`patched`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#patched) function to check which version of the code should be executed.\n\nPatching is a three-step process:\n\n1. Patch in new code with `patched` and run it alongside old code\n2. Remove old code and `deprecatePatch`\n3. When you are sure all old Workflows are done executing, remove `deprecatePatch`\n\n#### Step 1: Patch in new code\n\n`patched` inserts a marker into the Workflow history.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/139673361-35d61b38-ab94-401e-ae7b-feaa52eae8c6.png)\n\nDuring replay, when a Worker picks up a history with that marker it will fail the Workflow task when running Workflow code that does not emit the same patch marker (in this case `your-change-id`); therefore it is safe to deploy code from `v2` in a \"feature flag\" alongside the original version (`v1`).\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-2-->\n\n[patching-api/src/workflows-v2.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/patching-api/src/workflows-v2.ts)\n\n```ts\n// v2\nimport { patched } from '@temporalio/workflow';\nexport async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {\n  if (patched('my-change-id')) {\n    await activityB();\n    await sleep('1 days');\n  } else {\n    await activityA();\n    await sleep('1 days');\n    await activityThatMustRunAfterA();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n#### Step 2: Deprecate patch\n\nOnce we know that all Workflows started with `v1` code have completed we can [deprecate the patch](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#deprecatepatch).\nDeprecated patches bridge between `v2` and `vFinal` (the end result), they work similarly to regular patches by recording a marker in the Workflow history, this marker does not fail replay when Workflow code does not emit it.\n\nIf while we're deploying `v3` (below) there are still live Workers running `v2` code and those Workers pick up Workflow histories generated by `v3`, they will safely use the patched branch.\n\n<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-3-->\n\n[patching-api/src/workflows-v3.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/patching-api/src/workflows-v3.ts)\n\n```ts\n// v3\nimport { deprecatePatch } from '@temporalio/workflow';\n\nexport async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {\n  deprecatePatch('my-change-id');\n  await activityB();\n  await sleep('1 days');\n}\n```\n\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n#### Step 3: Solely deploy new code\n\n`vFinal` is safe to deploy once all `v2` or earlier Workflows are complete due to the assertion mentioned above.\n\n### Upgrading Workflow dependencies\n\nUpgrading Workflow dependencies (such as ones installed into `node_modules`) _might_ break determinism in unpredictable ways.\nWe recommended using a lock file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to fix Workflow dependency versions and gain control of when they're updated.\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"dev-guide/tscript","guide_id":"versioning","slug":"/dev-guide/typescript/versioning","local_ref":"","node_id":"typescript/versioning","node_title":"Versioning","node_description":"Versioning

It must have a non `void` return type.\n\n> It is possible (though not recommended for usability reasons) to annotate concrete class implementation.\n\nYou can have more than one method with the same annotation (except #[WorkflowMethod]).\n\nFor example:\n\n```php\nuse Temporal\\Workflow\\WorkflowInterface;\nuse Temporal\\Workflow\\WorkflowMethod;\nuse Temporal\\Workflow\\SignalMethod;\nuse Temporal\\Workflow\\QueryMethod;\n\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface FileProcessingWorkflow\n{\n    #[WorkflowMethod]\n    public function processFile(Argument $args);\n\n    #[QueryMethod(\"history\")]\n    public function getHistory(): array;\n\n    #[QueryMethod(\"status\")]\n    public function getStatus(): string;\n\n    #[SignalMethod]\n    public function retryNow(): void;\n\n    #[SignalMethod]\n    public function abandon(): void;\n}\n```\n\nNote that name parameter of Workflow method annotations can be used to specify name of Workflow, Signal and Query types.\nIf name is not specified the short name of the Workflow interface is used.\n\nIn the above code the `#[WorkflowMethod(name)]` is not specified, thus the Workflow Type defaults to `\"FileProcessingWorkflow\"`.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"php/handle-signal","node":{"file_name":"handle-signal.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/php/handle-signal.md","id":"php/handle-signal","title":"How

The Activity provides the information necessary for completion from an external system and notifies the Temporal service that it is waiting for that outside callback.\n2. The external service calls the Temporal service to complete the Activity.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the first part:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART samples-php-async-activity-completion-activity-class-->\n\n[app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/GreetingActivity.php](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/blob/master/app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/GreetingActivity.php)\n\n```php\nclass GreetingActivity implements GreetingActivityInterface\n{\n    private LoggerInterface $logger;\n\n    public function __construct()\n    {\n        $this->logger = new Logger();\n    }\n    /**\n     * Demonstrates how to implement an Activity asynchronously.\n     * When {@link Activity::doNotCompleteOnReturn()} is called,\n     * the Activity implementation function that returns doesn't complete the Activity.\n     */\n    public function composeGreeting(string $greeting, string $name): string\n    {\n        // In real life this request can be executed anywhere.

Workflow state has to be restored, its code is re-executed from the beginning.\nWhen replaying, side effects (such as Activity invocations) are ignored because they are already recorded in the Workflow event history.\nWhen writing Workflow logic, the replay is not visible, so the code should be written since it executes only once.\nThis design puts the following constraints on the Workflow implementation:\n\n- Do not use any mutable global variables because multiple instances of Workflows are executed in parallel.\n- Do not call any non-deterministic functions like non seeded random or `UUID` directly from the Workflow code.\n\nAlways do the following in the Workflow implementation code:\n\n- Don’t perform any IO or service calls as they are not usually deterministic. Use Activities for this.\n- Only use `Workflow::now()` to get the current time inside a Workflow.\n- Call `yield Workflow::timer()` instead of `sleep()`.\n- Do not use any blocking SPL provided by PHP (i.e. `fopen`, `PDO`, etc) in **Workflow code**.\n- Use `yield Workflow::getVersion()` when making any changes to the Workflow code. Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code\n  might break already open Workflows.\n- Don’t access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow Execution path.\n  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.\n\nWorkflow method arguments and return values are serializable to a byte array using the provided [DataConverter](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html) interface.\nThe default implementation uses JSON serializer, but you can use any alternative serialization mechanism.\n\nMake sure to annotate your `WorkflowMethod` using `ReturnType` to specify concrete return type.\n\n> You can not use the default return type declaration as Workflow methods are generators.\n\nThe values passed to Workflows through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the execution history.\nThe entire execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow workers with every event that the Workflow logic needs to process.\nA large execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.\nTherefore, be mindful of the amount of data that you transfer via Activity invocation parameters or return values.\nOtherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.\\*\\*\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"php/developing-activities","node":{"file_name":"developing-activities.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/php/developing-activities.md","id":"php/developing-activities","title":"How

storage](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-kv) and add the following lines to your `tests/.rr.test.yaml` file.\n\n```yaml\n# tests/.rr.test.yaml\nkv:\n  test:\n    driver: memory\n    config:\n      interval: 10\n```\n\nIf you want to be able to mock Activities, use `WorkerFactory` from the `Temporal\\Testing` Namespace\nin your PHP Worker:\n\n```php\n// worker.test.php\nuse Temporal\\Testing\\WorkerFactory;\n\n$factory = WorkerFactory::create();\n$worker = $factory->newWorker();\n\n$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(MyWorkflow::class);\n$worker->registerActivity(MyActivity::class);\n$factory->run();\n```\n\nThen, in your tests to mock an Activity, use the`ActivityMocker` class.\n\nAssume we have the following Activity:\n\n```php\n#[ActivityInterface(prefix: \"SimpleActivity.\")]\ninterface SimpleActivityInterface\n{\n    #[ActivityMethod('doSomething')]\n    public function doSomething(string $input): string;\n```\n\nTo mock it in the test, you can do this:\n\n```php\nfinal class SimpleWorkflowTestCase extends TestCase\n{\n    private WorkflowClient $workflowClient;\n    private ActivityMocker $activityMocks;\n\n    protected function setUp(): void\n    {\n        $this->workflowClient = new WorkflowClient(ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233'));\n        $this->activityMocks = new ActivityMocker();\n\n        parent::setUp();\n    }\n\n    protected function tearDown(): void\n    {\n        $this->activityMocks->clear();\n        parent::tearDown();\n    }\n\n    public function testWorkflowReturnsUpperCasedInput(): void\n    {\n        $this->activityMocks->expectCompletion('SimpleActivity.doSomething', 'world');\n        $workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(SimpleWorkflow::class);\n        $run = $this->workflowClient->start($workflow, 'hello');\n        $this->assertSame('world', $run->getResult('string'));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the preceding test case, we do the following:\n\n1. Instantiate `ActivityMocker` in the `setUp()` method of the test.\n2. Clear the cache after each test in `tearDown()`.\n3. Mock an Activity call to return a string `world`.\n\nTo mock a failure, use the `expectFailure()` method:\n\n```php\n$this->activityMocks->expectFailure('SimpleActivity.echo', new \\LogicException('something went wrong'));\n```\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"php/skip-time","node":{"file_name":"skip-time.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/php/skip-time.md","id":"php/skip-time","title":"How to skip time","description":"The test server included in most SDKs is an in-memory implementation of Temporal Server that supports skipping time.","label":"Skip time","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nSome long-running Workflows can persist for months or even years.\nImplementing the test framework allows your Workflow code to skip time and complete your tests in seconds rather than the Workflow's specified amount.\n\nFor example, if you have a Workflow sleep for a day, or have an Activity failure with a long retry interval, you don't need to wait the entire length of the sleep period to test whether the sleep function works.\nInstead, test the logic that happens after the sleep by skipping forward in time and complete your tests in a timely manner.\n\n:::note\n\nSkipping time is not relevant to unit testing Workflow code, because in that case you’re mocking functions that take time, like sleep and Activity calls.\n\n:::\n\nThe test framework included in most SDKs is an in-memory implementation of Temporal Server that supports skipping time.\nTime is a global property of an instance of `TestWorkflowEnvironment`: skipping time (either automatically or manually) applies to all currently running tests.\nIf you need different time behaviors for different tests, run your tests in a series or with separate instances of the test server.\nFor example, you could run all tests with automatic time skipping in parallel, and then all tests with manual time skipping in series, and then all tests without time skipping in parallel.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h4","id":"php/skip-time-set-up","node":{"file_name":"skip-time-set-up.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/php/skip-time-set-up.md","id":"php/skip-time-set-up","title":"Set up time skipping","description":"The test server included in most SDKs is an in-memory implementation of Temporal Server that supports skipping time.","label":"Setting up","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nLearn to set up the time-skipping test framework in the SDK of your choice.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"p","id":"php/how-to-skip-time-set-up-in-php","node":{"file_name":"how-to-skip-time-set-up-in-php.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/php/how-to-skip-time-set-up-in-php.md","id":"php/how-to-skip-time-set-up-in-php","title":"How to set up time skipping in PHP","description":"To set up time skipping, create `bootstrap.php` and add it to `phpunit.xml`.","label":"Set up time skipping","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","PHP"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n1.

This is useful for library-level code and implementation of DSLs.\n\nUse `Workflow.registerListener(Object)` to register an implementation of the `DynamicSignalListener` in the Workflow implementation code.\n\n```java\nWorkflow.registerListener(\n  (DynamicSignalHandler)\n      (signalName, encodedArgs) -> name = encodedArgs.get(0, String.class));\n```\n\nWhen registered, any Signals sent to the Workflow without a defined handler will be delivered to the `DynamicSignalHandler`.\nNote that you can only register one `Workflow.registerListener(Object)` per Workflow Execution.\n`DynamicSignalHandler` can be implemented in both regular and dynamic Workflow implementations.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"java/send-signal-from-client","node":{"file_name":"send-signal-from-client.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/java/send-signal-from-client.md","id":"java/send-signal-from-client","title":"How to send a Signal from a Temporal Client","description":"When a Signal is sent successfully from the Temporal Client, the WorkflowExecutionSignaled Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.","label":"Send Signal from Client","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nWhen a Signal is sent successfully from the Temporal Client, the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"p","id":"java/how-to-send-a-signal-from-a-client-in-java","node":{"file_name":"how-to-send-a-signal-from-a-client-in-java.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/java/how-to-send-a-signal-from-a-client-in-java.md","id":"java/how-to-send-a-signal-from-a-client-in-java","title":"How to send a Signal from a Client in Java","description":"To send a Signal to a Workflow Execution from a Client, call the Signal method, annotated with `@SignalMethod` in the Workflow interface, from the Client code.","label":"Send Signal from Client","tags":["java","developer-guide"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTo send a Signal to a Workflow Execution from a Client, call the Signal method, annotated with `@SignalMethod` in the Workflow interface, from the Client code.\n\nIn the following Client code example, we start the Workflow `greetCustomer` and call the Signal method `addCustomer` that is handled in the Workflow.\n\n```java\n// create a typed Workflow stub for GreetingsWorkflow\nGreetingsWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(GreetingsWorkflow.class,\n        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                // set the Task Queue\n                .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                // Workflow Id is recommended but not required\n                .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                .build());\n\n// start the Workflow\nWorkflowClient.start(workflow::greetCustomer);\n// send a Signal to the Workflow\nCustomer customer = new Customer(\"John\", \"Spanish\", \"john@john.com\");\nworkflow.addCustomer(customer);

to create a Temporal Client in Java","description":"To initialize a Workflow Client, create an instance of a `WorkflowClient`, create a client-side `WorkflowStub`, and then call a Workflow method (annotated with the `@WorkflowMethod` annotation).","label":"Connect to a dev Cluster","tags":["java","developer-guide"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA [Temporal Client](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the [Temporal Cluster](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster).\nCommunication with a Temporal Cluster includes, but isn't limited to, the following:\n\n- Starting Workflow Executions.\n- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.\n- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.\n- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.\n- Providing an Activity Task Token.\n\n:::caution\n\nA Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.\nHowever, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.\n\n:::\n\nWhen you are running a Cluster locally (such as [Temporalite](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#temporalite)), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.\nMany SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and [Docker Compose](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#docker-compose) serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).\n\nTo initialize a Workflow Client, create an instance of a `WorkflowClient`, create a client-side `WorkflowStub`, and then call a Workflow method (annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`).\n\nTo start a Workflow Execution, your Temporal Server must be running, and your front-end service must be accepting gRPC calls.\n\nTo establish a connection with the front-end service, use `WorkflowServiceStubs`.\n\n```java\nWorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();\n```\n\nYou can provide `WorkflowServiceStubsOptions` to override the default values for the gRPC calls.\n\nFor example, the default front-end service gRPC address is set to `127.0.0.1:7233`, where `7233` is the default port for the Temporal Frontend Service.\n\nIf your server is running on a different host or port from the default, you can set it as shown in the following example.\n\n```java\nWorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newInstance(\n                    WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder()\n                     .setTarget(TARGET_ENDPOINT)\n                            .build());\n```\n\nAfter the connection to the Temporal Frontend Service is established, create a Client for the service stub.\nThe Workflow Client helps with client-side APIs and is required by Workers.\n\nCreate an instance of a `WorkflowClient` for the Workflow service stub, and use `WorkflowClientOptions` to set options for the Workflow Client.\nThe following example shows how to create a `WorkflowClient` instance called \"client\" for the `WorkflowServiceStubs` \"service\" that we created in the previous example, and set `Namespace` option for the `WorkflowClient`.\n\n```java\nWorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(\n                service,\n                WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder()\n                        .setNamespace(“Abc”)\n                    .build());\n```\n\nFor more information, see [WorkflowClientOptions](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClientOptions.Builder.html).\n\n`WorkflowService` and `WorkflowClient` creation is a heavyweight operation, and will be resource-intensive if created each time you start a Workflow or send a Signal to it.\nThe recommended way is to create them once and reuse where possible.\n\nWith the Client defined, you can start interacting with the Temporal Frontend Service.\n\nTo initialize a Workflow in the Client, create a `WorkflowStub`, and start the Workflow Execution with `WorkflowClient.start()`.\nStarting Workflows or sending Signals or Queries to Workflows from within a Client must be done using `WorkflowStubs`.\n\n```java\nWorkflowClient workflowClient =  WorkflowClient.newInstance(service, clientOptions);\n // Create a Workflow stub.\n YourWorkflow workflow = workflowClient.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class);\n // Start Workflow asynchronously and call its \"yourWFMethod\" Workflow method\n WorkflowClient.start(workflow::yourWFMethod);\n```\n\nFor more information, see the following:\n\n- [How to spawn a Workflow Execution in

Definition](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition).\n\nIn the Temporal Java SDK programming model, a Workflow Definition comprises a Workflow interface annotated with `@WorkflowInterface` and a Workflow implementation that implements the Workflow interface.\n\nThe Workflow interface is a Java interface and is annotated with `@WorkflowInterface`.\nEach Workflow interface must have only one method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`.\n\n```java\n// Workflow interface\n@WorkflowInterface\npublic interface YourWorkflow {\n\n    @WorkflowMethod\n    String yourWFMethod(Arguments args);\n}\n```\n\nHowever, when using dynamic Workflows, do not specify a `@WorkflowMethod`, and implement the `DynamicWorkflow` directly in the Workflow implementation code.\n\nThe `@WorkflowMethod` identifies the method that is the starting point of the Workflow Execution.\nThe Workflow Execution completes when this method completes.\n\nYou can create interface inheritance hierarchies to reuse components across other Workflow interfaces.\nThe interface inheritance approach does not apply to `@WorkflowMethod` annotations.\n\nA Workflow implementation implements a Workflow interface.\n\n```java\n// Define the Workflow implementation which implements our getGreeting Workflow method.\n  public static class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nTo call Activities in your Workflow, call the Activity implementation.\n\nUse `ExternalWorkflowStub` to start or send Signals from within a Workflow to other running Workflow Executions.\n\nYou can also invoke other Workflows as Child Workflows with `Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub()` or `Workflow.newUntypedChildWorkflowStub()` within a Workflow Definition.\n\nUse [`DynamicWorkflow`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/workflow/DynamicWorkflow.html) to implement Workflow Types dynamically.\nRegister a Workflow implementation type that extends `DynamicWorkflow` to implement any Workflow Type that is not explicitly registered with the Worker.\n\nThe dynamic Workflow interface is implemented with the `execute` method. This method takes in `EncodedValues` that are inputs to the Workflow Execution.\nThese inputs can be specified by the Client when invoking the Workflow Execution.\n\n```java\npublic class

written to execute effectively once and to completion.\n\nThe following constraints apply when writing Workflow Definitions:\n\n- Do not use mutable global variables in your Workflow implementations.\n  This will ensure that multiple Workflow instances are fully isolated.\n- Your Workflow code must be deterministic.\n  Do not call non-deterministic functions (such as non-seeded random or `UUID.randomUUID()`) directly from the Workflow code.\n  The Temporal SDK provides specific API for calling non-deterministic code in your Workflows.\n- Do not use programming language constructs that rely on system time.\n  For example, only use `Workflow.currentTimeMillis()` to get the current time inside a Workflow.\n- Do not use native Java `Thread` or any other multi-threaded classes like `ThreadPoolExecutor`.\n  Use `Async.function` or `Async.procedure`, provided by the Temporal SDK, to execute code asynchronously.\n- Do not use synchronization, locks, or other standard Java blocking concurrency-related classes besides those provided by the Workflow class.\n  There is no need for explicit synchronization because multi-threaded code inside a Workflow is executed one thread at a time and under a global lock.\n  - Call `Workflow.sleep` instead of `Thread.sleep`.\n  - Use `Promise` and `CompletablePromise` instead of `Future` and `CompletableFuture`.\n  - Use `WorkflowQueue` instead of `BlockingQueue`.\n- Use `Workflow.getVersion` when making any changes to the Workflow code.\n  Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code might break already running Workflows.\n- Do not access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow Execution path.\n  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.\n- Use `DynamicWorkflow` when you need a default Workflow that can handle all Workflow Types that are not registered with a Worker.\n  A single implementation

[Activity](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/0.19.0/io/temporal/activity/Activity.html) Class implementing a specially annotated interface.\n\nAn Activity interface is annotated with `@ActivityInterface` and an Activity implementation implements this Activity interface.\nTo handle Activity types that do not have an explicitly registered handler, you can directly implement a dynamic Activity.\n\n```java\n@ActivityInterface\npublic interface GreetingActivities {\n    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);\n}\n```\n\nEach method defined in the Activity interface defines a separate Activity method.\nYou can annotate each method in the Activity interface with the `@ActivityMethod` annotation, but this is completely optional.\nThe following example uses the `@ActivityMethod` annotation for the method defined in the previous example.\n\n```java\n@ActivityInterface\npublic interface GreetingActivities {\n    @ActivityMethod\n    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);\n}\n```\n\nAn Activity implementation is a Java class that implements an Activity annotated interface.\n\n```java\n// Implementation for the

greeting, String name) {\n      return greeting + \" \" + name + \"!\";\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nUse `DynamicActivity` to implement any number of Activity types dynamically.\nWhen an Activity implementation that extends `DynamicActivity` is registered, it is called for any Activity type invocation that doesn't have an explicitly registered handler.\n\nThe dynamic Activity interface is implemented with the `execute` method, as shown in the following example.\n\n```java\n// Dynamic Activity implementation\n public static class DynamicGreetingActivityImpl implements DynamicActivity

`ActivityStub`.\nActivities are not executable on their own. You cannot start an Activity Execution by itself.\n\nNote that before an Activity Execution is invoked:\n\n- Activity options (either [`setStartToCloseTimeout`](/concepts/what-is-a-start-to-close-timeout) or [`ScheduleToCloseTimeout`](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule-to-close-timeout) are required) must be set for the Activity.\n  For details, see [How to set Activity timeouts](/java/activity-timeouts).\n- The Activity must be registered with a Worker.\n  See [Worker Program](/java/how-to-develop-a-worker-program-in-java)\n- Activity code must be thread-safe.\n\nActivities should only be instantiated using stubs from within a Workflow.\nAn `ActivityStub` returns a client-side stub that implements an Activity interface.\nYou can invoke Activities using `Workflow.newActivityStub`(type-safe) or `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub` (untyped).\n\nCalling a method on the Activity interface schedules the Activity invocation with the Temporal service, and generates an [`ActivityTaskScheduled` Event](/concepts/what-is-an-event#activitytaskscheduled).\n\nActivities can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously.\n\n**Invoking Activities Synchronously**\n\nIn the following example, we use the type-safe `Workflow.newActivityStub` within the \"FileProcessingWorkflow\" Workflow implementation to create a client-side stub of the `FileProcessingActivities` class. We also define `ActivityOptions` and set `setStartToCloseTimeout` option to one hour.\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingWorkflowImpl implements FileProcessingWorkflow {\n\n    private final FileProcessingActivities activities;\n\n    public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {\n        this.activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(\n                FileProcessingActivities.class,\n                ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n                        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofHours(1))\n                        .build());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void processFile(Arguments args) {\n        String localName = null;\n        String processedName = null;\n        try {\n            localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());\n            processedName = activities.processFile(localName);\n            activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);\n        } finally {\n            if (localName != null) {\n                activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);\n            }\n            if (processedName != null) {\n                activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nA Workflow can have multiple Activity stubs. Each Activity stub can have its own `ActivityOptions` defined.\nThe following example shows a Workflow implementation with two typed Activity stubs.\n\n```java\npublic FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {\n    ActivityOptions options1 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n             .setTaskQueue(\"taskQueue1\")\n             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(10))\n             .build();\n    this.store1 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options1);\n\n    ActivityOptions options2 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n             .setTaskQueue(\"taskQueue2\")\n             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(5))\n             .build();\n    this.store2 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options2);\n}\n```\n\nTo invoke Activities inside Workflows without referencing the interface it implements, use an untyped Activity stub `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub`.\nThis is useful when the Activity type is not known at compile time, or to invoke Activities implemented in different programming languages.\n\n```java\n   // Workflow code\n    ActivityOptions activityOptions =\n        ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3))\n        .setTaskQueue(\"simple-queue-node\")\n        .build();\n\n    ActivityStub activity = Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub(activityOptions);\n    activity.execute(\"ComposeGreeting\", String.class, \"Hello World\" , \"Spanish\");\n```\n\n**Invoking Activities Asynchronously**\n\nSometimes Workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.\nThe Temporal Java SDK provides the `Async` class which includes static methods used to invoke any Activity asynchronously.\nThe calls return a result of type `Promise` which is similar to the Java `Future` and `CompletionStage`.\nWhen invoking Activities, use `Async.function` for Activities that return a result, and `Async.procedure` for Activities that return void.\n\nIn the following asynchronous Activity invocation, the method reference is passed to `Async.function` followed by Activity arguments.\n\n```java\nPromise<String> localNamePromise = Async.function(activities::download, sourceBucket, sourceFile);\n```\n\nThe following example shows how to call two Activity methods, \"download\" and \"upload\", in parallel on multiple files.\n\n```java\n  public void processFile(Arguments args) {\n    List<Promise<String>> localNamePromises = new ArrayList<>();\n    List<String> processedNames = null;\n    try {\n      // Download all files in parallel.\n      for (String sourceFilename : args.getSourceFilenames()) {\n        Promise<String> localName =\n            Async.function(activities::download, args.getSourceBucketName(), sourceFilename);\n        localNamePromises.add(localName);\n      }\n      List<String> localNames = new ArrayList<>();\n      for (Promise<String> localName : localNamePromises) {\n        localNames.add(localName.get());\n      }\n      processedNames = activities.processFiles(localNames);\n\n      // Upload all results in parallel.\n      List<Promise<Void>> uploadedList = new ArrayList<>();\n      for (String processedName : processedNames) {\n        Promise<Void> uploaded =\n            Async.procedure(\n                activities::upload,\n                args.getTargetBucketName(),\n                args.getTargetFilename(),\n                processedName);\n        uploadedList.add(uploaded);\n      }\n      // Wait for all uploads to complete.\n      Promise.allOf(uploadedList).get();\n    } finally {\n      for (Promise<String> localNamePromise : localNamePromises) {\n        // Skip files that haven't completed downloading.\n        if (localNamePromise.isCompleted()) {\n          activities.deleteLocalFile(localNamePromise.get());\n        }\n      }\n      if (processedNames != null) {\n        for (String processedName : processedNames) {\n          activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n**Activity Execution Context**\n\n`ActivityExecutionContext` is a context object passed to each Activity implementation by default.\nYou can access it in your Activity implementations via `Activity.getExecutionContext()`.\n\nIt provides getters to access information about the Workflow that invoked the Activity.\nNote that the Activity context information is stored in a thread-local variable.\nTherefore, calls to `getExecutionContext()` succeed only within the thread that invoked the Activity function.\n\nFollowing is an example of using the `ActivityExecutionContext`:\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {\n\n  @Override\n  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {\n\n    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();\n    ActivityInfo info = ctx.getInfo();\n\n    log.info(\"namespace=\" +  info.getActivityNamespace());\n    log.info(\"workflowId=\" + info.getWorkflowId());\n    log.info(\"runId=\" + info.getRunId());\n    log.info(\"activityId=\" + info.getActivityId());\n    log.info(\"activityTimeout=\" + info.getStartToCloseTimeout();\n\n    return downloadFileFromS3(bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);\n  }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nFor details on getting the results of an Activity Execution, see [Activity Execution

completed upon its method return, call `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()` from the original Activity thread.\n\nThen later, when replies come, complete the Activity using the `ActivityCompletionClient`.\nTo correlate Activity invocation with completion, use either a `TaskToken` or Workflow and Activity Ids.\n\nFollowing is an example of using `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()`:\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {\n\n  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {\n\n    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();\n\n    // Used to correlate reply\n    byte[] taskToken = ctx.getInfo().getTaskToken();\n\n    asyncDownloadFileFromS3(taskToken, bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);\n    ctx.doNotCompleteOnReturn();\n\n    // Return value is ignored when doNotCompleteOnReturn was called.\n    return \"ignored\";\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nWhen the download is complete, the download service potentially can complete the Activity, or fail it from a different process, for example:\n\n```java\n  public <R> void completeActivity(byte[] taskToken, R result) {\n    completionClient.complete(taskToken, result);\n  }\n\n  public void failActivity(byte[] taskToken, Exception failure) {\n    completionClient.completeExceptionally(taskToken, failure);\n  }\n```\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"java/how-to-develop-a-worker-program-in-java","node":{"file_name":"how-to-develop-a-worker-program-in-java.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/java/how-to-develop-a-worker-program-in-java.md","id":"java/how-to-develop-a-worker-program-in-java","title":"How

Type and `worker.registerActivitiesImplementations` to register Activity implementation with Workers.\n\nFor Workflows, the Workflow Type is registered with a Worker.\nA Workflow Type can be registered only once per Worker entity.\nIf you define multiple Workflow implementations of the same type, you get an exception at the time of registration.\n\nFor Activities, Activity implementation instances are registered with a Worker because they are stateless and thread-safe.\nYou can pass any number of dependencies in the Activity implementation constructor, such as the database connections, services, etc.\n\nThe following example shows how to register a Workflow and an Activity with a Worker.\n\n```java\nWorker worker = workerFactory.newWorker(\"your_task_queue\");\n...\n// Register Workflow\nworker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(GreetingWorkflowImpl.class);\n// Register Activity\nworker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new GreetingActivitiesImpl());\n```\n\nWhen you register a single instance of an Activity, you can have multiple instances of Workflow Executions calling the same Activity.\nActivity code must be thread-safe because the same instance of the Activity code is run for every Workflow Execution that calls it.\n\nFor `DynamicWorkflow`, only one Workflow implementation that extends `DynamicWorkflow` can be registered with a Worker.\nThe following example shows how to register the `DynamicWorkflow` and `DynamicActivity` implementation with a Worker.\n\n```java\n  public static void main(String[] arg) {\n\n    WorkflowServiceStubs

It is more flexible because it has methods from the `WorkflowStub` interface, such as `start`, `signalWithStart`, `getResults` (sync and async), `query`, `signal`, `cancel` and `terminate`.\n  Note that the Temporal Java SDK also provides typed `WorkflowStub` versions for these methods.\n  When using untyped `WorkflowStub`, we rely on the Workflow Type, Activity Type, Child Workflow Type, as well as Query and Signal names.\n  For details, see [Temporal Client](/java/how-to-create-a-temporal-client-in-java).\n\nA Workflow Execution can be started either synchronously or asynchronously.\n\n- Synchronous invocation starts a Workflow and then waits for its completion. If the process that started the Workflow crashes or stops waiting, the Workflow continues executing.\n  Because Workflows are potentially long-running, and Client crashes happen, it is not very commonly found in production use.\n  The following example is a type-safe approach for starting a Workflow Execution synchronously.\n\n  ```java\n    NotifyUserAccounts workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(\n          NotifyUserAccounts.class,\n          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                  .setWorkflowId(\"notifyAccounts\")\n                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                  .build()\n          );\n\n  // start the Workflow and wait for a result.\n    workflow.notify(new String[] { \"Account1\", \"Account2\", \"Account3\", \"Account4\", \"Account5\",\n                  \"Account6\", \"Account7\", \"Account8\", \"Account9\", \"Account10\"});\n      }\n  // notify(String[] accountIds) is a Workflow method defined in the Workflow Definition.\n  ```\n\n- Asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller. This is the most common way to start Workflows in production code.\n  The `WorkflowClient` <https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClient.java)> provides some static methods, such as `start`, `execute`, `signalWithStart` etc., that help with starting your Workflows asynchronously.\n\n  The following examples show how to start Workflow Executions asynchronously, with either typed or untyped `WorkflowStub`.\n\n  - **Typed WorkflowStub Example**\n\n    ```java\n    // create typed Workflow stub\n    FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(FileProcessingWorkflow.class,\n          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                  .build());\n    // use WorkflowClient.execute to return future that contains Workflow result or failure, or\n    // use WorkflowClient.start to return WorkflowId and RunId of the started Workflow).\n    WorkflowClient.start(workflow::greetCustomer);\n    ```\n\n  - **Untyped WorkflowStub Example**\n\n    ```java\n    WorkflowStub untyped = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(\"FileProcessingWorkflow\",\n          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                  .build());\n\n    // blocks until Workflow Execution has been started (not until it completes)\n    untyped.start(argument);\n    ```\n\nYou can call a Dynamic Workflow implementation using an untyped `WorkflowStub`.\nThe following example shows how to call the Dynamic Workflow implementation in the Client code.\n\n```java\n    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);\n    /**\n      * Note that for this part of the client code, the dynamic Workflow implementation must\n      * be known to the Worker at runtime in order to dispatch Workflow tasks, and may be defined\n      * in the Worker definition as:*/\n    // worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(DynamicGreetingWorkflowImpl.class);\n\n    /* Create the Workflow stub to call the dynamic Workflow.\n    * Note that the Workflow Type is not explicitly registered with the Worker.*/\n    WorkflowOptions workflowOptions =\n        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).setWorkflowId(WORKFLOW_ID).build();\n    WorkflowStub workflow = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(\"DynamicWF\", workflowOptions);\n```\n\n`DynamicWorkflow` can be used to invoke different Workflow Types.\nTo check what type is running when your Dynamic Workflow `execute` method runs, use `getWorkflowType()` in the implementation code.\n\n```java\nString type = Workflow.getInfo().getWorkflowType();\n```\n\nSee [Workflow Execution Result](/java/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-java) for details on how to get the results of the Workflow Execution.\n\n**Using `ExternalWorkflowStub`**\n\nUse `ExternalWorkflowStub` within a Workflow to invoke, and send Signals to, other Workflows by type.\n\nThis helps particularly for executing Workflows written in other language SDKs, as shown in the following example.\n\n```java\n@Override\n  public String yourWFMethod(String name) {\n      ExternalWorkflowStub callOtherWorkflow = Workflow.newUntypedExternalWorkflowStub(\"OtherWFId\");\n    }\n```\n\nSee the [Temporal Polyglot](https://github.com/tsurdilo/temporal-polyglot) code for examples of executing Workflows written in other language SDKs.\n\n**Recurring start**\n\nYou can start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule by using [`setCronSchedule`](/java/how-to-set-a-cron-schedule-in-java) Workflow option in the Client

An asynchronous Workflow Execution immediately returns a value to the caller.","label":"Get Workflow results","tags":["java","developer-guide"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nIf the call to start a Workflow Execution is successful, you will gain access to the Workflow Execution's Run Id.\n\nThe Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace may be used to uniquely identify a Workflow Execution in the system and get its result.\n\nIt's possible to both block progress on the result (synchronous execution) or get the result at some other point in time (asynchronous execution).\n\nIn the Temporal Platform, it's also acceptable to use Queries as the preferred method for accessing the state and results of Workflow Executions.\n\nA synchronous Workflow Execution blocks your client thread until the Workflow Execution completes (or fails) and get the results (or error in case of failure).\n\nThe following example is a type-safe approach for getting the results of a synchronous Workflow Execution.\n\n```java\n FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(\n                FileProcessingWorkflow.class,\n                WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                        .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                        .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                        .build();\n\n// start sync and wait for results (or failure)\nString result = workflow.processfile(new Argument());\n```\n\nAn asynchronous Workflow Execution immediately returns a value to the caller.\n\nThe following examples show how to get the results of a Workflow Execution through typed and untyped `WorkflowStub`.\n\n- **Typed WorkflowStub Example**\n\n  ```java\n  // create typed Workflow stub\n  FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(FileProcessingWorkflow.class,\n                WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                        .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                        .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                        .build());\n  // use WorkflowClient.execute (if your Workflow takes in arguments) or WorkflowClient.start (for zero arguments)\n  WorkflowClient.start(workflow::greetCustomer);\n  ```\n\n- **Untyped WorkflowStub Example**\n\n  ```java\n  WorkflowStub untyped = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(\"FileProcessingWorkflow\",\n                  WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                          .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                          .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                          .build());\n\n  // blocks until Workflow Execution has been started (not until it completes)\n  untyped.start(argument);\n  ```\n\nIf you need to wait for a Workflow Execution to complete after an asynchronous start, the most straightforward way is to call the blocking Workflow instance again.\n\nNote that if `WorkflowOptions.WorkflowIdReusePolicy` is not set to `AllowDuplicate`, then instead of throwing `DuplicateWorkflowException`, it reconnects to an existing Workflow and waits for its completion.\n\nThe following example shows how to do this from a different process than the one that started the Workflow Execution.\n\n```java\nYourWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class, workflowId);\n\n// Returns the result after waiting for the Workflow to complete.\nString result = workflow.yourMethod();\n```\n\nAnother way to connect to an existing Workflow and wait for its completion from another process, is to use `UntypedWorkflowStub`. For example:\n\n```java\nWorkflowStub workflowStub = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(workflowType, workflowOptions);\n\n// Returns the result after waiting for the Workflow to complete.\nString result = untyped.getResult(String.class);\n```\n\n**Get last (successful) completion result**\n\nFor a Temporal Cron Job, get the result of previous successful runs using `GetLastCompletionResult()`.\nThe method returns `null` if there is no previous completion.\nThe following example shows how to implement this in a Workflow.\n\n```java\npublic String cronWorkflow() {\n    String lastProcessedFileName = Workflow.getLastCompletionResult(String.class);\n\n    // Process work starting from the lastProcessedFileName.\n    // Business logic implementation goes here.\n    // Updates lastProcessedFileName to the new value.\n\n    return lastProcessedFileName;\n}\n```\n\nNote that this works even if one of the Cron schedule runs failed.\nThe next schedule will still get the last successful result if it ever successfully completed at least once.\nFor example, for a daily cron Workflow, if the run succeeds on the first day and fails on the second day, then the third day run will get the result from first day's run using these APIs.\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"dev-guide/javalang","guide_id":"foundations","slug":"/dev-guide/java/foundations","local_ref":"","node_id":"java/foundations","node_title":"How

Java SDK provides a test framework to facilitate Workflow unit and integration testing.\nThe test framework provides a `TestWorkflowEnvironment` class which includes an in-memory implementation\nof the Temporal service that supports automatic time skipping. This allows you to\neasily test long-running Workflows in seconds, without having to change your Workflow code.\n\nYou can use the provided `TestWorkflowEnvironment` with a Java unit testing framework of your choice,\nsuch as JUnit.\n\n### Setup testing dependency\n\nTo start using the Java SDK test framework, you need to add [`io.temporal:temporal-testing`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.temporal/temporal-testing)\nas a dependency to your project:\n\n**[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)**:\n\n```maven\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.temporal</groupId>\n    <artifactId>temporal-testing</artifactId>\n    <version>1.17.0</version>\n    <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n**[Gradle Groovy DSL](https://gradle.org/)**:\n\n```groovy\ntestImplementation (\"io.temporal:temporal-testing:1.17.0\")\n```\n\nMake sure to set the version that matches your dependency version of the [Temporal Java SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java).\n\n### Sample unit tests\n\nThe following code implements unit tests for the `HelloActivity` sample:\n\n```java\npublic class HelloActivityTest {\n\n    private TestWorkflowEnvironment testEnv;\n    private Worker worker;\n    private WorkflowClient client;\n\n    // Set up the test workflow environment\n    @Before\n    public void setUp() {\n        testEnv = TestWorkflowEnvironment.newInstance();\n        worker = testEnv.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE);\n        // Register your workflow implementations\n        worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(GreetingWorkflowImpl.class);\n\n        client = testEnv.getWorkflowClient();\n    }\n\n    // Clean up test environment after tests are completed\n    @After\n    public void tearDown() {\n        testEnv.close();\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testActivityImpl() {\n        // This uses the actual activity impl\n        worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new GreetingActivitiesImpl());\n\n        // Start test environment\n        testEnv.start();\n\n        // Create the workflow stub\n        GreetingWorkflow workflow =\n                client.newWorkflowStub(\n                        GreetingWorkflow.class, WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).build());\n\n        // Execute our workflow waiting for it to complete\n        String greeting = workflow.getGreeting(\"World\");\n        assertEquals(\"Hello World!\", greeting);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn cases where you do not wish to execute your actual Activity implementations during\nunit testing, you can use a framework such as Mockito to mock them.\n\nThe following code implements a unit test for the `HelloActivity` sample which shows\nhow activities can be mocked:\n\n```java\npublic class HelloActivityTest {\n\n    private TestWorkflowEnvironment testEnv;\n    private Worker worker;\n    private WorkflowClient client;\n\n    // Set up the test workflow environment\n    @Before\n    public void setUp() {\n        testEnv = TestWorkflowEnvironment.newInstance();\n        worker = testEnv.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE);\n        // Register your workflow implementations\n        worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(GreetingWorkflowImpl.class);\n\n        client = testEnv.getWorkflowClient();\n    }\n\n    // Clean up test environment after tests are completed\n    @After\n    public void tearDown() {\n        testEnv.close();\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testMockedActivity() {\n        // Mock our workflow activity\n        GreetingActivities activities = mock(GreetingActivities.class);\n        when(activities.composeGreeting(\"Hello\", \"World\")).thenReturn(\"Hello Mocked World!\");\n        worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(activities);\n\n        // Start test environment\n        testEnv.start();\n\n        // Create the workflow stub\n        GreetingWorkflow workflow =\n                client.newWorkflowStub(\n                        GreetingWorkflow.class, WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).build());\n\n        // Execute our workflow waiting for it to complete\n        String greeting = workflow.getGreeting(\"World\");\n        assertEquals(\"Hello Mocked World!\", greeting);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Testing with JUnit4\n\nFor Junit4 tests, Temporal provides the TestWorkflowRule class which simplifies the Temporal test environment setup, as well as the\ncreation and shutdown of Workflow Workers in your tests.\n\nMake sure to set the version that matches your dependency version of the [Temporal Java SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java).\n\nWe can now rewrite our above mentioned \"HelloActivityTest\" test class as follows:\n\n```java\npublic class HelloActivityJUnit4Test {\n    @Rule\n    public TestWorkflowRule testWorkflowRule =\n            TestWorkflowRule.newBuilder()\n                    .setWorkflowTypes(GreetingWorkflowImpl.class)\n                    .setActivityImplementations(new GreetingActivitiesImpl())\n                    .build();\n\n    @Test\n    public void testActivityImpl() {\n        // Get a workflow stub using the same task queue the worker uses.\n        GreetingWorkflow workflow =\n                testWorkflowRule\n                        .getWorkflowClient()\n                        .newWorkflowStub(\n                                GreetingWorkflow.class,\n                                WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(testWorkflowRule.getTaskQueue()).build());\n        // Execute a workflow waiting for it to complete.\n        String greeting = workflow.getGreeting(\"World\");\n        assertEquals(\"Hello World!\", greeting);\n\n        testWorkflowRule.getTestEnvironment().shutdown();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Testing with JUnit5\n\nFor Junit5 tests, Temporal also provides the TestWorkflowExtension helped class which can be used to simplify the Temporal test environment setup\nas well as Workflow Worker startup and shutdowns.\n\nTo start using JUnit5 TestWorkflowExtension in your tests with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), you need to enable capability [`io.temporal:temporal-testing-junit5`]:\n\nMake sure to set the version that matches your dependency version of the [Temporal Java SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java).\n\nWe can now use JUnit5 and rewrite our above mentioned \"HelloActivityTest\" test class as follows:\n\n```java\npublic class HelloActivityJUnit5Test {\n    @RegisterExtension\n    public static final TestWorkflowExtension testWorkflowExtension =\n            TestWorkflowExtension.newBuilder()\n                    .setWorkflowTypes(GreetingWorkflowImpl.class)\n                    .setActivityImplementations(new GreetingActivitiesImpl())\n                    .build();\n\n    @Test\n    public void testActivityImpl(\n            TestWorkflowEnvironment testEnv, Worker worker, GreetingWorkflow workflow) {\n        // Execute a workflow waiting for it to complete.\n        String greeting = workflow.getGreeting(\"World\");\n        assertEquals(\"Hello World!\", greeting);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can find all unit tests for the [Temporal Java samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java) repository in [its test package](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/test/java/io/temporal/samples).\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"java/testing-activities","node":{"file_name":"testing-activities.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/java/testing-activities.md","id":"java/testing-activities","title":"Testing

errors.","label":"Versioning","tags":["java","workflow-versions"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAs outlined in the _Workflow Implementation Constraints_ section, Workflow code has to be deterministic by taking the same\ncode path when replaying history events. Any Workflow code change that affects the order in which commands are generated breaks\nthis assumption. The solution that allows updating code of already running Workflows is to keep both the old and new code.\nWhen replaying, use the code version that the events were generated with and when executing a new code path, always take the\nnew code.\n\n## Introduction to Versioning\n\nBecause we design for potentially long-running Workflows at scale, versioning with Temporal works differently than with other workflow systems.\nWe explain more in this optional 30-minute introduction: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY).\n\n## Java Versioning API\n\nUse the `Workflow.getVersion` function to return a version of the code that should be executed and then use the returned\nvalue to pick a correct branch. Let's look at an example.\n\n```java\npublic void processFile(Arguments args) {\n    String localName = null;\n    String processedName = null;\n    try {\n        localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());\n        processedName = activities.processFile(localName);\n        activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);\n    } finally {\n        if (localName != null) { // File was downloaded.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);\n        }\n        if (processedName != null) { // File was processed.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow we decide to calculate the processed file checksum and pass it to upload.\nThe correct way to implement this change is:\n\n```java\npublic void processFile(Arguments args) {\n    String localName = null;\n    String processedName = null;\n    try {\n        localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());\n        processedName = activities.processFile(localName);\n        int version = Workflow.getVersion(\"checksumAdded\", Workflow.DEFAULT_VERSION, 1);\n        if (version == Workflow.DEFAULT_VERSION) {\n            activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);\n        } else {\n            long checksum = activities.calculateChecksum(processedName);\n            activities.uploadWithChecksum(\n                args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName, checksum);\n        }\n    } finally {\n        if (localName != null) { // File was downloaded.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);\n        }\n        if (processedName != null) { // File was processed.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLater, when all Workflows that use the old version are completed, the old branch can be removed.\n\n```java\npublic void processFile(Arguments args) {\n    String localName = null;\n    String processedName = null;\n    try {\n        localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());\n        processedName = activities.processFile(localName);\n        // getVersion call is left here to ensure that any attempt to replay history\n        // for a different version fails. It can be removed later when there is no possibility\n        // of this happening.\n        Workflow.getVersion(\"checksumAdded\", 1, 1);\n        long checksum = activities.calculateChecksum(processedName);\n        activities.uploadWithChecksum(\n            args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName, checksum);\n    } finally {\n        if (localName != null) { // File was downloaded.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);\n        }\n        if (processedName != null) { // File was processed.\n            activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe Id that is passed to the `getVersion` call identifies the change. Each change is expected to have its own Id.

Tell the Task Queue your Worker is listening on about that Build ID, and whether its compatible with an existing Build ID.\n\n### Assign a Build ID to your Worker\n\nLet's say you've chosen `deadbeef` as your Build ID, which might be a short git commit hash (a reasonable choice as Build ID).\nTo assign it in your Worker code, assign the following Worker Options:\n\n```java\n// ...\nWorkerOptions workerOptions = WorkerOptions.newBuilder()\n    .setBuildId(\"deadbeef\")\n    .setUseBuildIdForVersioning(true)\n    // ...\n    .build();\nWorker w = workerFactory.newWorker(\"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions);\n// ...\n```\n\nThat's all you need to do in your Worker code.\nImportantly, if you start this Worker, it won't receive any tasks.\nThat's because you need to tell the Task Queue about your Worker's Build ID first.\n\n### Tell the Task Queue about your Worker's Build ID\n\nNow you can use the SDK (or the Temporal CLI) to tell the Task Queue about your Worker's Build ID.\nYou might want to do this as part of your CI deployment process.\n\n```java\n// ...\nworkflowClient.updateWorkerBuildIdCompatability(\n    \"your_task_queue_name\", BuildIdOperation.newIdInNewDefaultSet(\"deadbeef\"));\n```\n\nThis code adds the `deadbeef` Build ID to the Task Queue as the sole version in a new version set, which becomes the default for the queue.\nNew Workflows execute on Workers with this Build ID, and existing ones will continue to process by appropriately compatible Workers.\n\nIf, instead, you want to add the Build ID to an existing compatible set, you can do this:\n\n```java\n// ...\nworkflowClient.updateWorkerBuildIdCompatability(\n    \"your_task_queue_name\", BuildIdOperation.newCompatibleVersion(\"deadbeef\", \"some-existing-build-id\"));\n```\n\nThis code adds `deadbeef` to the existing compatible set containing `some-existing-build-id` and marks it as the new default Build ID for that set.\n\nYou can also promote an existing Build ID in a set to be the default for that set:\n\n```java\n// ...\nworkflowClient.updateWorkerBuildIdCompatability(\n    \"your_task_queue_name\", BuildIdOperation.promoteBuildIdWithinSet(\"deadbeef\"));\n```\n\nYou can also promote an entire set to become the default set for the queue. New Workflows will start using that set's default.\n\n```java\n// ...\nworkflowClient.updateWorkerBuildIdCompatability(\n    \"your_task_queue_name\", BuildIdOperation.promoteSetByBuildId(\"deadbeef\"));\n```\n\n### Specify versions for Commands\n\nBy default, Activities, Child Workflows, and Continue-as-New use the same compatible version set as the Workflow that invoked them if they're also using the same Task Queue.\n\nIf you want to override this behavior, you can specify your intent via the `setVersioningIntent` method on the `ActivityOptions`, `ChildWorkflowOptions`, or `ContinueAsNewOptions` objects.\n\n<!-- For more information refer to the [conceptual documentation](/concepts/what-is-worker-versioning). -->\n\nFor example, if you want to use the latest default version for an Activity, you can define your Activity Options like this:\n\n```java\n// ...\nprivate final MyActivity activity =\n    Workflow.newActivityStub(\n        MyActivity.class,\n        ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n          .setScheduleToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n

      return value, nil\n        })\n        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, \"test_success\")\n\n        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n

TestUnitTestSuite(t *testing.T) {\n        suite.Run(t, new(UnitTestSuite))\n}\n```\n\n#### Setup\n\nTo run unit tests, we first define a test suite struct that absorbs both the\nbasic suite functionality from [testify](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite)\nvia `suite.Suite` and the suite functionality from the Temporal test framework via\n`testsuite.WorkflowTestSuite`. Because every test in this test suite will test our Workflow, we\nadd a property to our struct to hold an instance of the test environment. This allows us to initialize\nthe test environment in a setup method. For testing Workflows, we use a `testsuite.TestWorkflowEnvironment`.\n\nNext, we implement a `SetupTest` method to set up a new test environment before each test. Doing so\nensures that each test runs in its own isolated sandbox. We also implement an `AfterTest` function\nwhere we assert that all the mocks we set up were indeed called by invoking `s.env.AssertExpectations(s.T())`.\n\nTimeout for the entire test can be set using `SetTestTimeout` in the Workflow or Activity environment.\n\nFinally, we create a regular test function recognized by the `go test` command, and pass the struct to `suite.Run`.\n\n#### A Simple Test\n\nThe simplest test case we can write is to have the test environment execute the Workflow and then\nevaluate the results.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_Success() {\n        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, \"test_success\")\n\n        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n        s.NoError(s.env.GetWorkflowError())\n}\n```\n\nCalling `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` executes the Workflow logic and any invoked Activities inside the\ntest process. The first parameter of `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` contains the Workflow functions,\nand any subsequent parameters contain values for custom input parameters declared by the Workflow\nfunction.\n\n> Note that unless the Activity invocations are mocked or Activity implementation\n> replaced (see [Activity mocking and overriding](#activity-mocking-and-overriding)), the test environment\n> will execute the actual Activity code including any calls to outside services.\n\nAfter executing the Workflow in the above example, we assert that the Workflow ran through completion\nvia the call to `s.env.IsWorkflowComplete()`. We also assert that no errors were returned by asserting\non the return value of `s.env.GetWorkflowError()`. If our Workflow returned a value, we could have\nretrieved that value via a call to `s.env.GetWorkflowResult(&value)` and had additional asserts on that\nvalue.\n\n#### Activity mocking and overriding\n\nWhen running unit tests on Workflows, we want to test the Workflow logic in isolation. Additionally,\nwe want to inject Activity errors during our test runs. The test framework provides two mechanisms\nthat support these scenarios: Activity mocking and Activity overriding. Both of these mechanisms allow\nyou to change the behavior of Activities invoked by your Workflow without the need to modify the actual\nWorkflow code.\n\nLet's take a look at a test that simulates a test that fails via the \"Activity mocking\" mechanism.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_ActivityFails() {\n        s.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(\n          \"\", errors.New(\"SimpleActivityFailure\"))\n        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, \"test_failure\")\n\n        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n\n        err := s.env.GetWorkflowError()\n        s.Error(err)\n        var applicationErr *temporal.ApplicationError\n        s.True(errors.As(err, &applicationErr))\n        s.Equal(\"SimpleActivityFailure\", applicationErr.Error())\n}\n```\n\nThis test simulates the execution of the Activity `SimpleActivity` that is invoked by our Workflow\n`SimpleWorkflow` returning an error. We accomplish this by setting up a mock on the test environment\nfor the `SimpleActivity` that returns an error.\n\n```go\ns.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(\n  \"\", errors.New(\"SimpleActivityFailure\"))\n```\n\nWith the mock set up we can now execute the Workflow via the `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` method and\nassert that the Workflow completed successfully and returned the expected error.\n\nSimply mocking the execution to return a desired value or error is a pretty powerful mechanism to\nisolate Workflow logic. However, sometimes we want to replace the Activity with an alternate implementation\nto support a more complex test scenario. Let's assume we want to validate that the Activity gets called\nwith the correct parameters.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_ActivityParamCorrect() {\n        s.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(\n          func(ctx context.Context, value string) (string, error) {\n                s.Equal(\"test_success\", value)\n                return value, nil\n        })\n        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, \"test_success\")\n\n        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n        s.NoError(s.env.GetWorkflowError())\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we provide a function implementation as the parameter to `Return`. This allows us to\nprovide an alternate implementation for the Activity `SimpleActivity`. The framework will execute this\nfunction whenever the Activity is invoked and pass on the return value from the function as the result\nof the Activity invocation. Additionally, the framework will validate that the signature of the \"mock\"\nfunction matches the signature of the original Activity function.\n\nSince this can be an entire function, there is no limitation as to what we can do here. In this\nexample, we assert that the `value` param has the same content as the value param we passed to the Workflow.\n\n#### Queries\n\n`TestWorkflowEnvironment` instances have a [`QueryWorkflow()` method](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/temporal/internal#TestWorkflowEnvironment.QueryWorkflow) that lets you query the state of the currently running Workflow.\nFor example, suppose you have a Workflow that lets you query the progress of a long running task as shown below.\n\n```go\nfunc ProgressWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, percent int) error {\n\tlogger := workflow.GetLogger(ctx)\n\n\terr := workflow.SetQueryHandler(ctx, \"getProgress\", func(input []byte) (int, error) {\n\t\treturn percent, nil\n\t})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlogger.Info(\"SetQueryHandler failed.\", \"Error\", err)\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\n\tfor percent = 0; percent<100; percent++ {\n                // Important! Use `workflow.Sleep()`, not `time.Sleep()`, because Temporal's\n                // test environment doesn't stub out `time.Sleep()`.\n\t\tworkflow.Sleep(ctx, time.Second*1)\n\t}\n\n\treturn nil\n}\n```\n\nThis Workflow tracks the current progress of a task in percentage terms, and increments the percentage by 1 every second.\nBelow is how you would write a test case that queries this Workflow.\nNote that you should always query the Workflow either after `ExecuteWorkflow()` is done or in a `RegisterDelayedCallback()` callback, otherwise you'll get a `runtime error` panic.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_ProgressWorkflow() {\n\tvalue := 0\n\n\t// After 10 seconds plus padding, progress should be 10.\n\t// Note that `RegisterDelayedCallback()` doesn't actually make your test wait for 10 seconds!\n\t// Temporal's test framework advances time internally, so this test should take < 1 second.\n\ts.env.RegisterDelayedCallback(func() {\n\t\tres, err := s.env.QueryWorkflow(\"getProgress\")\n\t\ts.NoError(err)\n\t\terr = res.Get(&value)\n\t\ts.NoError(err)\n\t\ts.Equal(10, value)\n\t}, time.Second*10+time.Millisecond*1)\n\n\ts.env.ExecuteWorkflow(ProgressWorkflow, 0)\n\n\ts.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n\n\t// Once the workflow is completed, progress should always be 100\n\tres, err := s.env.QueryWorkflow(\"getProgress\")\n\ts.NoError(err)\n\terr = res.Get(&value)\n\ts.NoError(err)\n\ts.Equal(value, 100)\n}\n```\n\n:::note\n\n`RegisterDelayedCallback` can also be used to send [Signals](/concepts/what-is-a-signal).\nWhen using \"Signal-With-Start\", set the delay to `0`.\n:::\n\n#### Debugging\n\nYou can use a debugger tool provided by your favorite IDE to debug your Workflow Definitions prior to testing or executing them.\n\nThe Temporal Go SDK includes deadlock detection which fails a Workflow Task in case the code blocks over a second without relinquishing execution control.\nBecause of this you can often encounter a `PanicError: Potential deadlock detected` while stepping through Workflow Definitions during debugging.\n\nTo alleviate this issue, you can set the `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` environment variable to `true` before debugging your Workflow Definition.\n\n:::note\n\nMake sure to set `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` to true only during debugging.\n\n:::\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"dev-guide/golang","guide_id":"debugging","slug":"/dev-guide/go/debugging","local_ref":"","node_id":"go/debugging","node_title":"Debugging","node_description":"Testing

object that can be passed to calls to spawn Activity Executions.\n\nPass an instance of `workflow.Context` and [`SessionOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#SessionOptions) to the `CreateSession` API call and get a Session Context that contains metadata information of the Session.\n\nUse the Session Context to spawn all Activity Executions that should belong to the Session.\nAll associated Activity Tasks are then processed by the same Worker Entity.\nWhen the `CreateSession` API is called, the Task Queue name that is specified in `ActivityOptions` (or in `StartWorkflowOptions` if the Task Queue name is not specified in `ActivityOptions`) is used, and a Session is created with one of the Workers polling that Task Queue.\n\nThe Session Context is cancelled if the Worker executing this Session dies or `CompleteSession()` is called.\nWhen using the returned Session Context to spawn Activity Executions, a `workflow.ErrSessionFailed` error is returned if the Session framework detects that the Worker executing this Session has died.\nThe failure of Activity Executions won't affect the state of the Session, so you still need to handle the errors returned from your Activities and call `CompleteSession()` if necessary.\n\nIf the context passed in already contains an open Session, `CreateSession()` returns an error.\nIf all the Workers are currently busy and unable to handle a new Session, the framework keeps retrying until the `CreationTimeout` period you specified in `SessionOptions` has passed before returning an error.\n(For more details, check the \"Concurrent Session Limitation\" section.)\n\n`CompleteSession()` releases the resources reserved on the Worker, so it's important to call it as soon as you no longer need the Session.\nIt cancels the session context and therefore all the Activity Executions using that Session Context.\nIt is safe to call `CompleteSession()` on a failed Session, meaning that you can call it from a `defer` function after the Session is successfully created.\n\nIf the Worker goes down between Activities, any scheduled Activities meant for the Session Worker are canceled.\nIf not, you get a `workflow.ErrSessionFailed` error when the next call of `workflow.ExecuteActivity()` is made from that Workflow.\n\n<a class=\"dacx-source-link\"

Session metadata, which can be retrieved by the `GetSessionInfo()` API.\nIf the Context passed in doesn't contain any Session metadata, this API will return a `nil` pointer.\n\n### Recreate Session\n\nFor long-running Sessions, you may want to use the `ContinueAsNew` feature to split the Workflow into multiple runs when all Activities need to be executed by the same Worker.\nThe `RecreateSession()` API is designed for such a use case.\n\n```go\nfunc RecreateSession(ctx Context, recreateToken []byte, sessionOptions *SessionOptions) (Context, error)\n```\n\nIts usage is the same as `CreateSession()` except that it also takes in a `recreateToken`, which is needed to create a new Session on the same Worker as the previous one.\nYou can get the token by calling the `GetRecreateToken()` method of the `SessionInfo` object.\n\n```go\ntoken := workflow.GetSessionInfo(sessionCtx).GetRecreateToken()\n```\n\n**Is there a complete example?**\n\nYes, the [file processing example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/master/fileprocessing) in the [temporalio/samples-go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go) repo has been updated to use the session framework.\n\n**What happens to my Activity if the Worker dies?**\n\nIf your Activity has already been scheduled, it will be canceled.\nIf not, you will get a `workflow.ErrSessionFailed` error when you call `workflow.ExecuteActivity()`.\n\n**Is the concurrent session limitation per process or per host?**\n\nIt's per Worker Process, so make sure there's only one Worker Process running on the host if you plan to use this feature.\n\n**Future Work**\n\n- Right now, a Session is considered failed if the Worker Process dies.\n  However, for some use cases, you may only care whether the Worker host is alive or not.\n  For these use cases, the Session should be automatically re-established if the Worker Process is restarted.\n\n- The current implementation assumes that all Sessions are consuming the same type of resource and there's only one global limitation.\n  Our plan is to allow you to specify what type of resource your Session will consume and enforce different limitations on different types of resources.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"go/error-handling","node":{"file_name":"error-handling.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/go/error-handling.md","id":"go/error-handling","title":"Error

can block on sending and receiving from Channels but as a bonus can listen on Future deferred work.\nUsage of Selectors to defer and process work (in place of Go's `select`) are necessary in order to ensure deterministic Workflow code execution (though using `select` in Activity code is fine).\n\n### Full API Example\n\nThe API is sufficiently different from `select` that it bears documenting:\n\n```go\nfunc SampleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) error {\n\t// standard Workflow setup code omitted...\n\n\t// API Example: declare a new selector\n\tselector := workflow.NewSelector(ctx)\n\n\t// API Example: defer code execution until the Future that represents Activity result is ready\n\twork := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ExampleActivity)\n\tselector.AddFuture(work, func(f workflow.Future) {\n\t\t// deferred code omitted...\n\t})\n\n\t// more parallel timers and activities initiated...\n\n\t// API Example: receive information from a Channel\n\tvar signalVal string\n\tchannel := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, channelName)\n\tselector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {\n\t\t// matching on the channel doesn't consume the message.\n\t \t// So it has to be explicitly consumed here\n\t\tc.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)\n\t\t// do something with received information\n\t})\n\n\t// API Example: block until the next Future is ready to run\n\t// important! none of the deferred code runs until you call selector.Select\n\tselector.Select(ctx)\n\n\t// Todo: document selector.HasPending\n}\n```\n\n### Using Selectors with Futures\n\nYou usually add `Future`s after `Activities`:\n\n```go\n// API Example: defer code execution until after an activity is done\nwork := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ExampleActivity)\nselector.AddFuture(work, func(f workflow.Future) {\n\t// deferred code omitted...\n})\n```\n\n`selector.Select(ctx)` is the primary mechanism which blocks on and executes `Future` work.\nIt is intentionally flexible; you may call it conditionally or multiple times:\n\n```go\n\t// API Example: blocking conditionally\n  if somecondition != nil {\n\t\tselector.Select(ctx)\n  }\n\n\t// API Example: popping off all remaining Futures\n  for i := 0; i < len(someArray); i++ {\n\t\tselector.Select(ctx) // this will wait for one branch\n\t\t// you can interrupt execution here\n\t}\n```\n\nA Future matches only once per Selector instance even if Select is called multiple times.\nIf multiple items are available, the order of matching is not defined.\n\n#### Using Selectors with Timers\n\nAn important use case of futures is setting up a race between a timer and a pending activity, effectively adding a \"soft\" timeout that doesn't result in any errors or retries of that activity.\n\nFor example, [the Timer sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/master/timer) shows how you can write a long running order processing operation where:\n\n- if processing takes too long, we send out a notification email to user about the delay, but we won't cancel the operation\n- if the operation finishes before the timer fires, then we want to cancel the timer.\n\n```go\nvar processingDone bool\nf := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, OrderProcessingActivity)\nselector.AddFuture(f, func(f workflow.Future) {\n\tprocessingDone = true\n\t// cancel timerFuture\n\tcancelHandler()\n})\n\n// use timer future to send notification email if processing takes too long\ntimerFuture := workflow.NewTimer(childCtx, processingTimeThreshold)\nselector.AddFuture(timerFuture, func(f workflow.Future) {\n\tif !processingDone {\n\t\t// processing is not done yet when timer fires, send notification email\n\t\t_ = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, SendEmailActivity).Get(ctx, nil)\n\t}\n})\n\n// wait the timer or the order processing to finish\nselector.Select(ctx)\n```\n\nWe create timers with the `workflow.NewTimer` API.\n\n### Using Selectors with Channels\n\n`selector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {})` is the primary mechanism which receives messages from `Channels`.\n\n```go\n// API Example: receive information from a Channel\nvar signalVal string\nchannel := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, channelName)\nselector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {\n\tc.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)\n\t// do something with received information\n})\n```\n\nMerely matching on the channel doesn't consume the message; it has to be explicitly consumed with a `c.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)` call.\n\n### Querying Selector State\n\nYou can use the `selector.HasPending` API to ensure that signals are not lost when a Workflow is closed (e.g. by `ContinueAsNew`).\n\n### Learn More\n\nUsage of Selectors is best learned by example:\n\n- Setting up a race condition between an Activity and a Timer, and conditionally execute ([Timer example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/14980b3792cc3a8447318fefe9a73fe0a580d4b9/timer/workflow.go))\n- Receiving information in a Channel ([Mutex example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/14980b3792cc3a8447318fefe9a73fe0a580d4b9/mutex/mutex_workflow.go))\n- Looping through a list of work and scheduling them all in parallel ([DSL example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/14980b3792cc3a8447318fefe9a73fe0a580d4b9/dsl/workflow.go))\n- Executing activities in parallel, pick the first result, cancel remainder ([Pick First example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/14980b3792cc3a8447318fefe9a73fe0a580d4b9/pickfirst/pickfirst_workflow.go))\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"dev-guide/golang","guide_id":"features","slug":"/dev-guide/go/features","local_ref":"","node_id":"go/features","node_title":"How

|\n\n#### MaxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize\n\nSets the maximum concurrent Activity Executions for the Worker.\n\n- Type: `int`\n- Default: `1000`\n\nA value of `0` sets to the default.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n  MaxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize: 1000,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### WorkerActivitiesPerSecond\n\nRate limits the number of Activity Task Executions started per second for the Worker.\n\n- Type: `float64`\n- Default: `100000`\n\nA value of `0` sets to the default.\n\nIntended use case is to limit resources used by the Worker.\n\nNotice that the value type is a float so that the value can be less than 1 if needed.\nFor example, if set to 0.1, Activity Task Executions will happen once every ten seconds.\nThis can be used to protect down stream services from flooding with requests.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tWorkerActivitiesPerSecond: 100000,\n  // ..\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### MaxConcurrentLocalActivityExecutionSize\n\nSet the maximum concurrent [Local Activity Executions](/concepts/what-is-a-local-activity) for the Worker.\n\n- Type: `int`\n- Default: `1000`\n\nA value of `0` sets to the default value.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tMaxConcurrentLocalActivityExecutionSize: 1000,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### WorkerLocalActivitiesPerSecond\n\nRate limits the number of Local Activity Executions per second executed for the Worker.\n\n- Type: `float64`\n- Default: `100000`\n\nA value of `0` sets to the default value.\n\nIntended use case is to limit resources used by the Worker.\n\nNotice that the value type is a float so that the value can be less than 1 if needed.\nFor example, if set to 0.1, Local Activity Task Executions will happen once every ten seconds.\nThis can be used to protect down stream services from flooding with requests.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tWorkerLocalActivitiesPerSecond: 100000,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### TaskQueueActivitiesPerSecond\n\nRate limits the number of Activity Executions that can be started per second.\n\n- Type: `float64`\n- Default: `100000`\n\nA value of `0` sets to the default value.\n\nThis rate is managed by the Temporal Cluster and limits the Activity Tasks per second for the entire Task Queue. This is in contrast to [`WorkerActivityTasksPerSecond`](#workeractivitytaskspersecond) controls activities only per Worker.\n\nNotice that the number is represented in float, so that you can set it to less than 1 if needed.\nFor example, set the number to 0.1 means you want your Activity to be executed once for every 10 seconds.\nThis can be used to protect down stream services from flooding.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tTaskQueueActivitiesPerSecond: 100000,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### MaxConcurrentActivityTaskPollers\n\nSets the maximum number of goroutines to concurrently poll the Task Queue for Activity Tasks.\n\n- Type: `int`\n- Default: `2`\n\nChanging this value will affect the rate at which the Worker is able to consume Activity Tasks from the Task Queue.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tMaxConcurrentActivityTaskPollers: 2,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize\n\nSets the maximum number of concurrent Workflow Task Executions the Worker can have.\n\n- Type: `int`\n- Default: `1000`\n\nA value of `0` sets to the default value.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tMaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize: 1000,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPollers\n\nSets the maximum number of goroutines that will concurrently poll the Task Queue for Workflow Tasks.\n\n- Type: `int`\n- Default: `2`\n\nChanging this value will affect the rate at which the Worker is able to consume Workflow Tasks from the Task Queue.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tMaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPollers: 2,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### EnableLoggingInReplay\n\nSet to enable logging in Workflow Execution replays.\n\n- type: `bool`\n- Default: `false`\n\nIn Workflow Definitions you can use [`workflow.GetLogger(ctx)`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLogger) to write logs.\nBy default, the logger will skip logging during replays, so you do not see duplicate logs.\n\nThis is only really useful for debugging purpose.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tEnableLoggingInReplay: false,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### DisableStickyExecution\n\n:::caution Deprecated\n\nWhen DisableStickyExecution is `true` it can harm performance.\nIt will be removed soon.\nSee [`SetStickyWorkflowCacheSize`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#SetStickyWorkflowCacheSize) instead.\n\n:::\n\nSet to disable Sticky Executions\n\n- Type: `bool`\n- Default: `false`\n\nSticky Execution runs Workflow Tasks of a Workflow Execution on same host (could be a different Worker, as long as it is on the same host).\nThis is an optimization for Workflow Executions.\nWhen sticky execution is enabled, Worker keeps the Workflow state in memory.\nNew Workflow Task contains the new history events will be dispatched to the same Worker.\nIf this Worker crashes, the sticky Workflow Task will timeout after `StickyScheduleToStartTimeout`, and Temporal Cluster will clear the stickiness for that Workflow Execution and automatically reschedule a new Workflow Task that is available for any Worker to pick up and resume the progress.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tStickyScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Second(5),\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### StickyScheduleToStartTimeout\n\nSets the Sticky Execution Schedule-To-Start Timeout for Workflow Tasks.\n\n- Type: [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration)\n- Default value is `5`\n\nThe resolution is in seconds.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tStickyScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Second(5),\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### BackgroundActivityContext\n\n:::caution Not recommended\n\nThis method of passing dependencies between Activity Task Executions is not recommended anymore.\n\nInstead, we recommend using a struct with fields that contain dependencies and develop Activity Definitions as struct methods and then pass all the dependencies on the structure initialization.\n\n- [How to develop an Activity Definition using the Go SDK](/go/how-to-develop-an-activity-definition-in-go)\n\n:::\n\n- Type: [`context.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context)\n\nSets the background `context.Context` for all Activity Types registered with the Worker.\n\nThe context can be used to pass external dependencies such as database connections to Activity Task Executions.\n\n```go\n// ...\nctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), \"your-key\", \"your-value\")\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tBackgroundActivityContext: ctx,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### WorkflowPanicPolicy\n\nSets how the Workflow Worker handles a non-deterministic Workflow Execution History Event and other panics from Workflow Definition code.\n\n- Type: [`WorkflowPanicPolicy`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#WorkflowPanicPolicy)\n- Default: `BlockWorkflow`\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tDisableStickyExecution: internal.BlockWorkflow,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### WorkerStopTimeout\n\nSets the Worker's graceful stop timeout\n\n- Type: [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration)\n- Default: `0`\n\nValue resolution is in seconds.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tWorkerStopTimeout: time.Second(0),\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### EnableSessionWorker\n\nEnables Sessions for Activity Workers.\n\n- Type: `bool`\n- Default: `false`\n\nWhen `true` the Activity Worker creates a Session to sequentially process Activity Tasks for the given Task Queue.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tEnableSessionWorker: true,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### MaxConcurrentSessionExecutionSize\n\nSets the maximum number of concurrent Sessions that the Worker can support.\n\n- Type: `int`\n- Default: 1000\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tMaxConcurrentSessionExecutionSize: 1000,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### WorkflowInterceptorChainFactories\n\nSpecifies the factories used to instantiate the Workflow interceptor chain.\n\n- Type: [`[]WorkflowInterceptor`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#WorkflowInterceptor)\n\nThe chain is instantiated for each replay of a Workflow Execution.\n\n#### LocalActivityWorkerOnly\n\nSets the Worker to only handle Workflow Tasks and local Activity Tasks.\n\n- Type: `bool`\n- Default: `false`\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tLocalActivityWorkerOnly: 1000,\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### Identity\n\nSets the Temporal Client-level Identity value, overwriting the existing one.\n\n- Type: string\n- Default: client identity\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tIdentity: \"your_custom_identity\",\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\n#### DeadlockDetectionTimeout\n\nSets the maximum time that a Workflow Task can execute for.\n\n- Type: [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration)\n- Default: 1\n\nResolution is in seconds.\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n\tDeadlockDetectionTimeout: time.Second(1),\n  // ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n//

the call graph of a Workflow along with its Activities and any Child Workflows.\n\nTracing can be configured by providing an [opentracing.Tracer](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go#Tracer)\nimplementation in [ClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions) during client instantiation.\nFor more details on how to configure and leverage tracing, see the [OpenTracing documentation](https://opentracing.io/docs/getting-started/).\n\nThe OpenTracing support has been validated using [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), but other implementations mentioned [here](https://opentracing.io/docs/supported-tracers/) should also work.\nTracing functionality utilizes generic context propagation provided by the client.\n\n### Context Propagation\n\nTemporal provides a standard way to propagate a custom context across a Workflow.\nYou can configure a context propagator in via the [ClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions).\nThe context propagator extracts and passes on information present in `context.Context` and `workflow.Context` objects across the Workflow.\nOnce a context propagator is configured, you should be able to access the required values in the context objects as you would normally do in Go.\nYou can see how the Go SDK implements a [tracing context propagator](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/internal/tracer.go).\n\n#### Server-Side Headers\n\nOn the server side, Temporal provides a mechanism for propagating context across Workflow transitions called headers.\n\n```proto\nmessage Header {\n    map<string, Payload> fields = 1;\n}\n```\n\n`Client` leverages headers to pass around additional context information.\n[HeaderReader](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#HeaderReader) and [HeaderWriter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#HeaderWriter) are interfaces that allow reading and writing to the Temporal Server headers.\nThe SDK includes [implementations](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/internal/headers.go) for these interfaces.\n`HeaderWriter` sets a value for a header.\nHeaders are held as a map, so setting a value for the same key will overwrite its previous value.\n`HeaderReader` gets a value of a header.\nIt also can iterate through all headers and execute the provided handler function on each header, so that your code can operate on select headers you need.\n\n```go\ntype HeaderWriter interface {\n\tSet(string, *commonpb.Payload)\n}\n\ntype HeaderReader interface {\n\tGet(string) (*commonpb.Payload, bool)\n\tForEachKey(handler func(string, *commonpb.Payload) error) error\n}\n```\n\n#### Context Propagators\n\nYou can propagate additional context through Workflow Execution by using a context propagator.\nA context propagator needs to implement the `ContextPropagator` interface that includes the following four methods:\n\n```go\ntype ContextPropagator interface {\n  Inject(context.Context, HeaderWriter) error\n\n  Extract(context.Context, HeaderReader) (context.Context, error)\n\n  InjectFromWorkflow(Context, HeaderWriter) error\n\n  ExtractToWorkflow(Context, HeaderReader) (Context, error)\n}\n```\n\n- `Inject` reads select context keys from a Go [context.Context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/#Context) object and writes them into the headers using the [HeaderWriter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#HeaderWriter) interface.\n- `InjectFromWorkflow` operates similar to `Inject` but reads from a [workflow.Context](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#Context) object.\n- `Extract` picks select headers and put their values into the [context.Context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/#Context) object.\n- `ExtractToWorkflow` operates similar to `Extract` but write to a [workflow.Context](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#Context) object.\n\nThe [tracing context propagator](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/internal/tracer.go) shows a sample implementation of a context propagator.\n\n#### Is there a complete example?\n\nThe [context propagation sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/master/ctxpropagation/) configures a custom context propagator and shows context propagation of custom keys across a Workflow and an Activity.\nIt also uses Jaeger for tracing.\n\n#### Can I configure multiple context propagators?\n\nYes. Multiple context propagators help to structure code with each propagator having its own scope of responsibility.\n\n### Useful Resources\n\n- [Passing Context with

Go SDK provides a test framework to facilitate testing Workflow implementations.\n\nThis framework is suited for implementing unit tests as well as functional tests of the Workflow logic.\n\n## Test setup\n\nTo run unit tests, we first define a test suite struct that absorbs both the basic suite functionality from [testify](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite) via `suite.Suite` and the suite functionality from the Temporal test framework via `testsuite.WorkflowTestSuite`.\n\nBecause every test in this test suite will test our Workflow, we\nadd a property to our struct to hold an instance of the test environment. This allows us to initialize the test environment in a setup method.\n\nFor testing Workflows, we use a `testsuite.TestWorkflowEnvironment`.\n\n```go\ntype UnitTestSuite struct {\n        suite.Suite\n        testsuite.WorkflowTestSuite\n\n        env *testsuite.TestWorkflowEnvironment\n}\n```\n\nNext, we implement a `SetupTest` method to set up a new test environment before each test.\nDoing so ensures that each test runs in its own isolated sandbox.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) SetupTest() {\n        s.env = s.NewTestWorkflowEnvironment()\n}\n```\n\nWe also implement an `AfterTest` function where we assert that all the mocks we set up were indeed called by invoking `s.env.AssertExpectations(s.T())`.\nTimeout for the entire test can be set using `SetTestTimeout` in the Workflow or Activity environment.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) AfterTest(suiteName, testName string) {\n        s.env.AssertExpectations(s.T())\n}\n```\n\nFinally, we create a regular test function recognized by the `go test` command, and pass the struct to `suite.Run`.\n\n```go\nfunc TestUnitTestSuite(t *testing.T) {\n        suite.Run(t, new(UnitTestSuite))\n}\n```\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"go/testing-activities","node":{"file_name":"testing-activities.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/go/testing-activities.md","id":"go/testing-activities","title":"Testing Activities","description":"Testing provides a framework to facilitate Workflow and integration testing.","label":"Test Activities","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAn Activity can be tested with a mock Activity environment, which provides a way to mock the Activity context, listen to Heartbeats, and cancel the Activity.\nThis behavior allows you to test the Activity in isolation by calling it directly, without needing to create a Worker to run the Activity.\n\n## Mock and override Activities\n\nWhen running unit tests on Workflows, we want to test the Workflow logic in isolation. Additionally, we want to inject Activity errors during our test runs. The test framework provides two mechanisms that support these scenarios: Activity mocking and Activity overriding. Both of these mechanisms allow you to change the behavior of Activities invoked by your Workflow without the need to modify the actual Workflow code.\n\nLet's take a look at a test that simulates a test that fails via the \"Activity mocking\" mechanism.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_ActivityFails() {\n        s.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(\n          \"\", errors.New(\"SimpleActivityFailure\"))\n        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, \"test_failure\")\n\n        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n\n        err := s.env.GetWorkflowError()\n        s.Error(err)\n        var applicationErr *temporal.ApplicationError\n        s.True(errors.As(err, &applicationErr))\n        s.Equal(\"SimpleActivityFailure\", applicationErr.Error())\n}\n```\n\nThis test simulates the execution of the Activity `SimpleActivity` that is invoked by our Workflow `SimpleWorkflow` returning an error. We accomplish this by setting up a mock on the test environment for the `SimpleActivity` that returns an error.\n\n```go\ns.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(\n  \"\", errors.New(\"SimpleActivityFailure\"))\n```\n\nWith the mock set up we can now execute the Workflow via the `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` method and assert that the Workflow completed successfully and returned the expected error.\n\nSimply mocking the execution to return a desired value or error is a pretty powerful mechanism to isolate Workflow logic.\nHowever, sometimes we want to replace the Activity with an alternate implementation to support a more complex test scenario.\nLet's assume we want to validate that the Activity gets called with the correct parameters.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_ActivityParamCorrect() {\n        s.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(\n          func(ctx context.Context, value string) (string, error) {\n                s.Equal(\"test_success\", value)\n                return value, nil\n        })\n        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, \"test_success\")\n\n        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n        s.NoError(s.env.GetWorkflowError())\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we provide a function implementation as the parameter to `Return`.\nThis allows us to provide an alternate implementation for the Activity `SimpleActivity`.\nThe framework will execute this function whenever the Activity is invoked and pass on the return value from the function as the result of the Activity invocation.\n\nAdditionally, the framework will validate that the signature of the \"mock\" function matches the signature of the original Activity function.\n\nSince this can be an entire function, there is no limitation as to what we can do here. In this example, we assert that the `value` param has the same content as the value param we passed to the Workflow.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"go/run-an-activity","node":{"file_name":"run-an-activity.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/go/run-an-activity.md","id":"go/run-an-activity","title":"Run an Activity","description":"If an Activity references its context, you need to mock that context when testing in isolation.","label":"Run an Activity","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nIf an Activity references its context, you need to mock that context when testing in isolation.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"go/listen-to-heartbeats","node":{"file_name":"listen-to-heartbeats.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/go/listen-to-heartbeats.md","id":"go/listen-to-heartbeats","title":"Listen to Heartbeats","description":"When an Activity sends a Heartbeat, be sure that you can see the Heartbeats in your test code so that you can verify them.","label":"Listen to Heartbeats","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nWhen an Activity sends a Heartbeat, be sure that you can see the Heartbeats in your test code so that you can verify them.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"go/cancel-an-activity","node":{"file_name":"cancel-an-activity.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/go/cancel-an-activity.md","id":"go/cancel-an-activity","title":"Cancel an Activity","description":"If an Activity is supposed to react to Cancellation, you can test whether it reacts correctly by canceling it.","label":"Cancel an Activity","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nIf an Activity is supposed to react to a Cancellation, you can test whether it reacts correctly by canceling it.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"go/testing-workflows","node":{"file_name":"testing-workflows.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/go/testing-workflows.md","id":"go/testing-workflows","title":"Testing Workflows","description":"Testing provides a framework to facilitate Workflow and integration testing.","label":"Test Workflows","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nWhen running unit tests on Workflows, we want to test the Workflow logic in isolation.\nThe simplest test case we can write is to have the test environment execute the Workflow and then evaluate the results.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_Success() {\n        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, \"test_success\")\n\n        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n        s.NoError(s.env.GetWorkflowError())\n}\n```\n\nCalling `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` executes the Workflow logic and any invoked Activities inside the test process. The first parameter of `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` contains the Workflow functions, and any subsequent parameters contain values for custom input parameters declared by the Workflow.\n\n> Note that unless the Activity invocations are mocked or Activity implementation replaced (see [Activity mocking and overriding](#activity-mocking-and-overriding)), the test environment will execute the actual Activity code including any calls to outside services.\n\nAfter executing the Workflow in the above example, we assert that the Workflow ran through completion via the call to `s.env.IsWorkflowComplete()`. We also assert that no errors were returned by asserting on the return value of `s.env.GetWorkflowError()`.\nIf our Workflow returned a value, we could have retrieved that value via a call to `s.env.GetWorkflowResult(&value)` and had additional asserts on that value.\n\n## Query tests\n\n`TestWorkflowEnvironment` instances have a [`QueryWorkflow()` method](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/temporal/internal#TestWorkflowEnvironment.QueryWorkflow) that lets you query the state of the currently running Workflow.\nFor example, suppose you have a Workflow that lets you query the progress of a long running task as shown below.\n\n```go\nfunc ProgressWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, percent int) error {\n\tlogger := workflow.GetLogger(ctx)\n\n\terr := workflow.SetQueryHandler(ctx, \"getProgress\", func(input []byte) (int, error) {\n\t\treturn percent, nil\n\t})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlogger.Info(\"SetQueryHandler failed.\", \"Error\", err)\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\n\tfor percent = 0; percent<100; percent++ {\n                // Important! Use `workflow.Sleep()`, not `time.Sleep()`, because Temporal's\n                // test environment doesn't stub out `time.Sleep()`.\n\t\tworkflow.Sleep(ctx, time.Second*1)\n\t}\n\n\treturn nil\n}\n```\n\nThis Workflow tracks the current progress of a task in percentage terms, and increments the percentage by 1 every second.\nBelow is how you would write a test case that queries this Workflow.\nNote that you should always query the Workflow either after `ExecuteWorkflow()` is done or in a `RegisterDelayedCallback()` callback, otherwise you'll get a `runtime error` panic.\n\n```go\nfunc (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_ProgressWorkflow() {\n\tvalue := 0\n\n\t// After 10 seconds plus padding, progress should be 10.\n\t// Note that `RegisterDelayedCallback()` doesn't actually make your test wait for 10 seconds!\n\t// Temporal's test framework advances time internally, so this test should take < 1 second.\n\ts.env.RegisterDelayedCallback(func() {\n\t\tres, err := s.env.QueryWorkflow(\"getProgress\")\n\t\ts.NoError(err)\n\t\terr = res.Get(&value)\n\t\ts.NoError(err)\n\t\ts.Equal(10, value)\n\t}, time.Second*10+time.Millisecond*1)\n\n\ts.env.ExecuteWorkflow(ProgressWorkflow, 0)\n\n\ts.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())\n\n\t// Once the workflow is completed, progress should always be 100\n\tres, err := s.env.QueryWorkflow(\"getProgress\")\n\ts.NoError(err)\n\terr = res.Get(&value)\n\ts.NoError(err)\n\ts.Equal(value, 100)\n}\n```\n\n:::note\n\n`RegisterDelayedCallback` can also be used to send [Signals](/concepts/what-is-a-signal).\nWhen using \"Signal-With-Start\", set the delay to `0`.\n:::\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"go/mock-activities","node":{"file_name":"mock-activities.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/go/mock-activities.md","id":"go/mock-activities","title":"How

sourcing\nto reconstruct the Workflow state by replaying the saved history event data on the Workflow\ndefinition code. This means that any incompatible update to the Workflow Definition code could cause\na non-deterministic issue if not handled correctly.\n\n## Introduction to Versioning\n\nBecause we design for potentially long running Workflows at scale, versioning with Temporal works differently. We explain more in this optional 30 minute introduction: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY)\n\n## workflow.GetVersion()\n\nConsider the following Workflow Definition:\n\n```go\nfunc YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, data string) (string, error) {\n        ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{\n                ScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Minute,\n                StartToCloseTimeout:    time.Minute,\n        }\n        ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)\n        var result1 string\n        err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n        if err != nil {\n                return \"\", err\n        }\n        var result2 string\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityB, result1).Get(ctx, &result2)\n        return result2, err\n}\n```\n\nNow let's say we have replaced ActivityA with ActivityC, and deployed the updated code. If there\nis an existing Workflow Execution that was started by the original version of the Workflow code, where\nActivityA had already completed and the result was recorded to history, the new version of the Workflow\ncode will pick up that Workflow Execution and try to resume from there. However, the Workflow will fail\nbecause the new code expects a result for ActivityC from the history data, but instead it gets the\nresult for ActivityA. This causes the Workflow to fail on the non-deterministic error.\n\nThus we use `workflow.GetVersion().`\n\n```go\nvar err error\nv := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, \"Step1\", workflow.DefaultVersion, 1)\nif v == workflow.DefaultVersion {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n} else {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityC, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n}\nif err != nil {\n        return \"\", err\n}\n\nvar result2 string\nerr = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityB, result1).Get(ctx, &result2)\nreturn result2, err\n```\n\nWhen `workflow.GetVersion()` is run for the new Workflow Execution, it records a marker in the Workflow history so that all future calls to `GetVersion` for this change Id—`Step 1` in the example—on this Workflow Execution will always return the given version number, which is `1` in the example.\n\nIf you make an additional change, such as replacing ActivityC with ActivityD, you need to\nadd some additional code:\n\n```go\nv := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, \"Step1\", workflow.DefaultVersion, 2)\nif v == workflow.DefaultVersion {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n} else if v == 1 {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityC, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n} else {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n}\n```\n\nNote that we have changed `maxSupported` from 1 to 2. A Workflow that had already passed this\n`GetVersion()` call before it was introduced will return `DefaultVersion`. A Workflow that was run\nwith `maxSupported` set to 1, will return 1. New Workflows will return 2.\n\nAfter you are sure that all of the Workflow Executions prior to version 1 have completed, you can remove the code for that version.\nIt should now look like the following:\n\n```go\nv := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, \"Step1\", 1, 2)\nif v == 1 {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityC, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n} else {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n}\n```\n\nYou'll note that `minSupported` has changed from `DefaultVersion` to `1`.\nIf an older version of the Workflow Execution history is replayed on this code, it fails because the minimum expected version is 1.\nAfter you are sure that all of the Workflow Executions for version 1 have completed, you can remove version 1 so that your code looks like the following:\n\n```go\n_ := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, \"Step1\", 2, 2)\nerr = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n```\n\nNote that we have preserved the call to `GetVersion()`. There are two reasons to preserve this call:\n\n1. This ensures that if there is a Workflow Execution still running for an older version, it will\n   fail here and not proceed.\n2. If you need to make additional changes for `Step1`, such as changing ActivityD to ActivityE, you\n   only need to update `maxVersion` from 2 to 3 and branch from there.\n\nYou only need to preserve the first call to `GetVersion()` for each `changeID`. All subsequent calls to\n`GetVersion()` with the same change Id are safe to remove. If necessary, you can remove the first\n`GetVersion()` call, but you need to ensure the following:\n\n- All executions with an older version are completed.\n- You can no longer use `Step1` for the changeId. If you need to make changes to that same part in\n  the future, such as change from ActivityD to ActivityE, you would need to use a different changeId\n  like `Step1-fix2`, and start minVersion from DefaultVersion again. The code would look like the\n  following:\n\n```go\nv := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, \"Step1-fix2\", workflow.DefaultVersion, 1)\nif v == workflow.DefaultVersion {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n} else {\n        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityE, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n}\n```\n\nUpgrading a Workflow is straightforward if you don't need to preserve your currently running Workflow Executions.\nYou can simply terminate all of the currently running Workflow Executions and suspend new ones from being created while you deploy the new version of your Workflow code, which does not use `GetVersion()`, and then resume Workflow creation.\nHowever, that is often not the case, and you need to take care of the currently running Workflow Executions, so using `GetVersion()` to update your code is the method to use.\n\nHowever, if you want your currently running Workflows to proceed based on the current Workflow logic,\nbut you want to ensure new Workflows are running on new logic, you can define your Workflow as a\nnew `WorkflowType`, and change your start path (calls to `StartWorkflow()`) to start the new Workflow\ntype.\n\n## Sanity checking\n\nThe Temporal client SDK performs a sanity check to help prevent obvious incompatible changes.\nThe sanity check verifies whether a Command made in replay matches the event recorded in history,\nin the same order. The Command is generated by calling any of the following methods:\n\n- workflow.ExecuteActivity()\n- workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow()\n- workflow.NewTimer()\n- workflow.RequestCancelWorkflow()\n- workflow.SideEffect()\n- workflow.SignalExternalWorkflow()\n- workflow.Sleep()\n\nAdding, removing, or reordering any of the above methods triggers the sanity check and results in\na non-deterministic error.\n\nThe sanity check does not perform a thorough check. For example, it does not check on the Activity's\ninput arguments or the timer duration. If the check is enforced on every property, then it becomes\ntoo restricted and harder to maintain the Workflow code. For example, if you move your Activity code\nfrom one package to another package, that changes the `ActivityType`, which technically becomes a different\nActivity. But, we don't want to fail on that change, so we only check the function name part of the\n`ActivityType`.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"go/how-to-use-worker-versioning-in-go","node":{"file_name":"how-to-use-worker-versioning-in-go.md","file_path":"/Users/flossypurse/Temporal/documentation/docs-src/go/how-to-use-worker-versioning-in-go.md","id":"go/how-to-use-worker-versioning-in-go","title":"How to use Worker Versioning in Go","description":"Version your Go Workers by using build ID–based versioning","label":"Worker Versioning","tags":["go","how-to"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTo use Worker Versioning in Go, you need to do the following:\n\n1. Determine and assign a Build ID to your built Worker code, and opt in to versioning.\n2. Tell the Task Queue your Worker is listening on about that Build ID, and whether its compatible with an existing Build ID.\n\n### Assign a Build ID to your Worker\n\nLet's say you've chosen `deadbeef` as your Build ID, which might be a short git commit hash (a reasonable choice as Build ID).\nTo assign it in your Worker code, you assign the following Worker Options:\n\n```go\n// ...\nworkerOptions := worker.Options{\n   BuildID: \"deadbeef\",\n   UseBuildIDForVersioning: true,\n// ...\n}\nw := worker.New(c, \"your_task_queue_name\", workerOptions)\n// ...\n```\n\nThat's all you need to do in your Worker code.\nImportantly, if you start this Worker, it won't receive any tasks.\nThat's because you need to tell the Task Queue about your Worker's Build ID first.\n\n### Tell the Task Queue about your Worker's Build ID\n\nNow you can use the SDK (or the Temporal CLI) to tell the Task Queue about your Worker's Build ID.\nYou might want to do this as part of your CI deployment process.\n\n```go\n// ...\nerr := client.UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibility(ctx, &client.UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibilityOptions{\n   TaskQueue: \"your_task_queue_name\",\n   Operation: &client.BuildIDOpAddNewIDInNewDefaultSet{\n      BuildID: \"deadbeef\",\n   },\n})\n```\n\nThis code adds the `deadbeef` Build ID to the Task Queue as the sole version in a new version set, which becomes the default for the queue.\nNew Workflows execute on Workers with this Build ID, and existing ones will continue to process by appropriately compatible Workers.\n\nIf, instead, you want to add the Build ID to an existing compatible set, you can do this:\n\n```go\n// ...\nerr := client.UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibility(ctx, &client.UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibilityOptions{\n   TaskQueue: \"your_task_queue_name\",\n   Operation: &client.BuildIDOpAddNewCompatibleVersion{\n      BuildID:                   \"deadbeef\",\n      ExistingCompatibleBuildId: \"some-existing-build-id\",\n   },\n})\n```\n\nThis code adds `deadbeef` to the existing compatible set containing `some-existing-build-id` and marks it as the new default Build ID for that set.\n\nYou can also promote an existing Build ID in a set to be the default for that set:\n\n```go\n// ...\nerr := client.UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibility(ctx, &client.UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibilityOptions{\n   TaskQueue: \"your_task_queue_name\",\n   Operation: &client.BuildIDPromoteIDWithinSet{\n      BuildID: \"some-existing-build-id\",\n   },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also promote an entire set to become the default set for the queue. New Workflows will start using that set's default.\n\n```go\n// ...\nerr := client.UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibility(ctx, &client.UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibilityOptions{\n   TaskQueue: \"your_task_queue_name\",\n   Operation: &client.BuildIDPromoteSet{\n      BuildID: \"some-existing-build-id\",\n   },\n})\n```\n\n### Specify versions for Commands\n\nBy default, Activities, Child Workflows, and Continue-as-New use the same compatible version set as the Workflow that invoked them if they're also using the same Task Queue.\n\nIf you want to override this behavior, you can specify your intent via the `VersioningIntent` field on the appropriate options struct.\n\n<!-- For more information refer to the [conceptual documentation](/concepts/what-is-worker-versioning). -->\n\nFor example, if you want to use the latest default version for an Activity, do the following inside your Workflow code:\n\n```go\n// ...\nao := workflow.ActivityOptions{\n    VersioningIntent: VersioningIntentDefault,\n    // ...other options\n}\nactivityCtx := workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)\nvar yourActivityResult YourActivityResultType\nerr := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)\n// ...\n```\n","is_empty":false}}],"link_index":[{"file_dir":"dev-guide/golang","guide_id":"versioning","slug":"/dev-guide/go/versioning","local_ref":"","node_id":"go/versioning","node_title":"Versioning","node_description":"Version
