Supported providers are S3, GCloud, and the local file system.\n- **URI**: Specifies which provider should be used. The system uses the URI schema and path to make the determination.\n\nTake the following steps to set up Archival:\n\n1. [Set up the provider](#providers) of your choice.\n2. [Configure Archival](#configuration).\n3. [Create a Namespace](#namespace-creation) that uses a valid URI and has Archival enabled.\n\n#### Providers\n\nTemporal directly supports several providers:\n\n- **Local file system**: The [filestore archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/filestore) is used to archive data in the file system of whatever host the Temporal server is running on. This provider is used mainly for local installations and testing and should not be relied on for production environments.\n- **Google Cloud**: The [gcloud archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/gcloud) is used to connect and archive data with [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/storage).\n- **S3**: The [s3store archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/s3store) is used to connect and archive data with [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3).\n- **Custom**: If you want to use a provider that is not currently supported, you can [create your own archiver](/clusters/how-to-create-a-custom-archiver) to support it.\n\nMake sure that you save the provider's storage location URI in a place where you can reference it later, because it is passed as a parameter when you [create a Namespace](#namespace-creation).\n\n#### Configuration\n\nArchival configuration is defined in the [`config/development.yaml`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/config/development.yaml#L93) file.\nLet's look at an example configuration:\n\n```yaml\n# Cluster level Archival config\narchival:\n  # Event History configuration\n  history:\n    # Archival is enabled at the cluster level\n    state: \"enabled\"\n    enableRead: true\n    # Namespaces can use either the local filestore provider or the Google Cloud provider\n    provider:\n      filestore:\n        fileMode: \"0666\"\n        dirMode: \"0766\"\n      gstorage:\n        credentialsPath: \"/tmp/gcloud/keyfile.json\"\n\n# Default values for a Namespace if none are provided at creation\nnamespaceDefaults:\n  # Archival defaults\n  archival:\n    # Event History defaults\n    history:\n      state: \"enabled\"\n      # New Namespaces will default to the local provider\n      URI: \"file:///tmp/temporal_archival/development\"\n```\n\nYou can disable Archival by setting `archival.history.state` and `namespaceDefaults.archival.history.state` to `\"disabled\"`.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\narchival:\n  history:\n    state: \"disabled\"\n\nnamespaceDefaults:\n  archival:\n    history:\n      state: \"disabled\"\n```\n\nThe following table showcases acceptable values for each configuration and what purpose they serve.\n\n| Config                                         | Acceptable values                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                  |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `archival.history.state`                       | `enabled`, `disabled`                                                              | Must be `enabled` to use the Archival feature with any Namespace in the cluster.                                             |\n| `archival.history.enableRead`                  | `true`, `false`                                                                    | Must be `true` to read from the archived Event History.                                                                      |\n| `archival.history.provider`                    | Sub provider configs are `filestore`, `gstorage`, `s3`, or `your_custom_provider`. | Default config specifies `filestore`.                                                                                        |\n| `archival.history.provider.filestore.fileMode` | File permission string                                                             | File permissions of the archived files. We recommend using the default value of `\"0666\"` to avoid read/write issues.         |\n| `archival.history.provider.filestore.dirMode`  | File permission string                                                             | Directory permissions of the archive directory. We recommend using the default value of `\"0766\"` to avoid read/write issues. |\n| `namespaceDefaults.archival.history.state`     | `enabled`, `disabled`                                                              | Default state of the Archival feature whenever a new Namespace is created without specifying the Archival state.             |\n| `namespaceDefaults.archival.history.URI`       | Valid URI                                                                          | Must be a URI of the file store location and match a schema that correlates to a provider.                                   |\n\n#### Namespace creation\n\nAlthough Archival is configured at the cluster level, it operates independently within each Namespace.\nIf an Archival URI is not specified when a Namespace is created, the Namespace uses the value of `defaultNamespace.archival.history.URI` from the `config/development.yaml` file.\nThe Archival URI cannot be changed after the Namespace is created.\nEach Namespace supports only a single Archival URI, but each Namespace can use a different URI.\nA Namespace can safely switch Archival between `enabled` and `disabled` states as long as Archival is enabled at the cluster level.\n\nArchival is supported in [Global Namespaces](/concepts/what-is-a-global-namespace) (Namespaces that span multiple clusters).\nWhen Archival is running in a Global Namespace, it first runs on the active cluster; later it runs on the standby cluster. Before archiving, a history check is done to see what has been previously archived.\n\n#### Test setup\n\nTo test Archival locally, start by running a Temporal server:\n\n```bash\n./temporal-server start\n```\n\nThen register a new Namespace with Archival enabled.\n\n```bash\n./tctl --ns samples-namespace namespace register --gd false --history_archival_state enabled --retention 3\n```\n\n:::note\n\nIf the retention period isn't set, it defaults to two days.\nThe minimum retention period is one day.\nThe maximum retention period is 30 days.\n\nSetting the retention period to 0 results in the error _A valid retention period is not set on request_.\n\n:::\n\nNext, run a sample Workflow such as the [helloworld temporal sample](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-go-samples/tree/master/helloworld).\n\nWhen execution is finished, Archival occurs.\n\n#### Retrieve archives\n\nYou can retrieve archived Event Histories by copying the `workflowId` and `runId` of the completed Workflow from the log output and running the following command:\n\n```bash\n./tctl --ns samples-namespace wf show --wid <workflowId> --rid <runId>\n```\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"clusters/how-to-create-a-custom-archiver","node":{"file_name":"how-to-create-a-custom-archiver.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/clusters/how-to-create-a-custom-archiver.md","id":"clusters/how-to-create-a-custom-archiver","title":"How to create a custom Archiver","description":"To archive data with a given provider, using the Archival feature, Temporal must have a corresponding Archiver component installed.","label":"Custom Archiver","tags":["how-to"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTo archive data with a given provider, using the [Archival](/concepts/what-is-archival) feature, Temporal must have a corresponding Archiver component installed.\nThe platform does not limit you to the existing providers.\nTo use a provider that is not currently supported, you can create your own Archiver.\n\n#### Create a new package\n\nThe first step is to create a new package for your implementation in [/common/archiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver).\nCreate a directory in the archiver folder and arrange the structure to look like the following:\n\n```\ntemporal/common/archiver\n  - filestore/                      -- Filestore implementation\n  - provider/\n      - provider.go                 -- Provider of archiver instances\n  - yourImplementation/\n      - historyArchiver.go          -- HistoryArchiver implementation\n      - historyArchiver_test.go     -- Unit tests for HistoryArchiver\n      - visibilityArchiver.go       -- VisibilityArchiver implementations\n      - visibilityArchiver_test.go  -- Unit tests for VisibilityArchiver\n```\n\n#### Archiver interfaces\n\nNext, define objects that implement the [HistoryArchiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/interface.go#L80) and the [VisibilityArchiver](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/interface.go#L121) interfaces.\n\nThe objects should live in `historyArchiver.go` and `visibilityArchiver.go`, respectively.\n\n#### Update provider\n\nUpdate the `GetHistoryArchiver` and `GetVisibilityArchiver` methods of the `archiverProvider` object in the [/common/archiver/provider/provider.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/provider/provider.go) file so that it knows how to create an instance of your archiver.\n\n#### Add configs\n\nAdd configs for your archiver to the `config/development.yaml` file and then modify the [HistoryArchiverProvider](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/config/config.go#L376) and [VisibilityArchiverProvider](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/config/config.go#L393) structs in `/common/common/config.go` accordingly.\n\n#### Custom archiver FAQ\n\n**If my custom Archive method can automatically be retried by the caller, how can I record and access progress between retries?**\n\nHandle this situation by using `ArchiverOptions`.\nHere is an example:\n\n```go\nfunc(a * Archiver) Archive(ctx context.Context, URI string, request * ArchiveRequest, opts...ArchiveOption) error {\n    featureCatalog: = GetFeatureCatalog(opts...) // this function is defined in options.go\n    var progress progress\n    // Check if the feature for recording progress is enabled.\n    if featureCatalog.ProgressManager != nil {\n        if err: = featureCatalog.ProgressManager.LoadProgress(ctx, & prevProgress);\n        err != nil {\n            // log some error message and return error if needed.\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Your archiver implementation...\n\n    // Record current progress\n    if featureCatalog.ProgressManager != nil {\n        if err: = featureCatalog.ProgressManager.RecordProgress(ctx, progress);\n        err != nil {\n            // log some error message and return error if needed.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**If my `Archive` method encounters an error that is non-retryable, how do I indicate to the caller that it should not retry?**\n\n```go\nfunc(a * Archiver) Archive(ctx context.Context, URI string, request * ArchiveRequest, opts...ArchiveOption) error {\n    featureCatalog: = GetFeatureCatalog(opts...) // this function is defined in options.go\n\n    err: = youArchiverImpl()\n\n    if nonRetryableErr(err) {\n        if featureCatalog.NonRetryableError != nil {\n            return featureCatalog.NonRetryableError() // when the caller gets this error type back it will not retry anymore.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**How does my history archiver implementation read history?**\n\nThe archiver package provides a utility called [HistoryIterator](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/historyIterator.go) which is a wrapper of [ExecutionManager](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/persistence/dataInterfaces.go#L1014).\n`HistoryIterator` is more simple than the `HistoryManager`, which is available in the BootstrapContainer, so archiver implementations can choose to use it when reading Workflow histories.\nSee the [historyIterator.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/historyIterator.go) file for more details.\nUse the [filestore historyArchiver implementation](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/filestore) as an example.\n\n**Should my archiver define its own error types?**\n\nEach archiver is free to define and return its own errors.\nHowever, many common errors that exist between archivers are already defined in [common/archiver/constants.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/archiver/constants.go).\n\n**Is there a generic query syntax for the visibility archiver?**\n\nCurrently, no.\nBut this is something we plan to do in the future.\nAs for now, try to make your syntax similar to the one used by our advanced list Workflow API.\n\n- [s3store](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/master/common/archiver/s3store#visibility-query-syntax)\n-

Server","tags":["how-to"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nIf a newer version of the [Temporal Server](/concepts/what-is-the-temporal-server) is available, a notification appears in the Temporal Web UI.\n\n:::info\n\nIf you are using a version that is older than 1.0.0, reach out to us at [community.temporal.io](http://community.temporal.io) to ask how to upgrade.\n\n:::\n\nFirst check to see if an upgrade to the database schema is required for the version you wish to upgrade to.\nIf a database schema upgrade is required, it will be called out directly in the [release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases).\nSome releases require changes to the schema, and some do not.\nWe ensure that any consecutive versions are compatible in terms of database schema upgrades, features, and system behavior; however there is no guarantee that there is compatibility between _any_ two non-consecutive versions.\n\nWhen upgrading your Temporal Server version, ensure that you upgrade sequentially.\nFor example, when upgrading from v1.n.x, always upgrade to v1.n+1.x (or the next available version) and so on until you get to the required version.\n\nThe Temporal Server upgrade updates or rewrites the old version data with the format introduced in the newer version.\nBecause Temporal Server guarantees backward compatibility between two consecutive minor versions, and because older versions of the code are eventually removed from the code base, skipping versions when upgrading might cause older formats to become unrecognizable.\nIf the old format of the data can't be read to be rewritten to the new format, the upgrades fail.\n\nCheck the [Temporal Server releases](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases) and follow these releases in order.\nYou can skip patch versions; use the latest patch of a minor version when upgrading.\n\nAlso be aware that each upgrade requires the History Service to load all Shards and update the Shard metadata, so allow approximately 10 minutes on each version for these processes to complete before upgrading to the next version.\n\nUse one of the upgrade tools to upgrade your database schema to be compatible with the Temporal Server version being upgraded to.\n\nIf you are using a schema tools version prior to 1.8.0, we strongly recommend _never_ using the \"dryrun\" (`-y`, or `--dryrun`) options in any of your schema update commands.\nUsing this option might lead to potential loss of data, as when using it will create a new database and drop your\nexisting one.\nThis flag was removed in the 1.8.0 release.\n\n### Upgrade Cassandra schema\n\nIf you are using Cassandra for your Cluster's persistence, use the `temporal-cassandra-tool` to upgrade both the default and visibility schemas.\n\n**Example default schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\ntemporal_v1.2.1 $ temporal-cassandra-tool \\\n   --tls \\\n   --tls-ca-file <...> \\\n   --user <cassandra-user> \\\n   --password <cassandra-password> \\\n   --endpoint <cassandra.example.com> \\\n   --keyspace temporal \\\n   --timeout 120 \\\n   update \\\n   --schema-dir ./schema/cassandra/temporal/versioned\n```\n\n**Example visibility schema upgrade:**\n\n```bash\ntemporal_v1.2.1 $ temporal-cassandra-tool \\\n   --tls \\\n   --tls-ca-file <...> \\\n   --user <cassandra-user> \\\n   --password <cassandra-password> \\\n   --endpoint <cassandra.example.com> \\\n   --keyspace temporal_visibility \\\n   --timeout 120 \\\n   update \\\n   --schema-dir ./schema/cassandra/visibility/versioned\n```\n\n### Upgrade MySQL / PostgreSQL schema\n\nIf you are using MySQL or PostgreSQL use the `temporal-sql-tool`, which works similarly to the `temporal-cassandra-tool`.\n\nRefer to this [Makefile](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.4.1/Makefile#L367-L383) for context.\n\n#### PostgreSQL\n\n**Example default schema

Some sections may be incomplete. Information may change at any time.\n\n:::\n\n:::info General company security\n\nFor information about the general security habits of Temporal Technologies see our [company security page](/temporal-technologies-inc-security).\n\n:::\n\nThe Temporal Plaform is designed with security in mind, and there are many features that you can use to keep both the Platform itself and your user's data secure.\n\nA secured Temporal Server has its network communication encrypted and has authentication and authorization protocols set up for API calls made to it.\nWithout these, your server could be accessed by unwanted entities.\n\nWhat is documented on this page are the built-in opt-in security measures that come with Temporal.\nHowever users may also choose to design their own security architecture with reverse proxies or run unsecured instances inside of a VPC environment.\n\n### Server Samples\n\nThe https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server repo offers two examples, which are further explained below:\n\n- **TLS**: how to configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure network communication with and within a Temporal cluster.\n- **Authorizer**: how to inject a low-level authorizer component that can control access to all API calls.\n\n### Encryption in transit with mTLS\n\nTemporal supports Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) as a way of encrypting network traffic between the services of a cluster and also between application processes and a Cluster.\nSelf-signed or properly minted certificates can be used for mTLS.\nmTLS is set in Temporal's [TLS configuration](/references/configuration/#tls).\nThe configuration includes two sections such that intra-Cluster and external traffic can be encrypted with different sets of certificates and settings:\n\n- `internode`: Configuration for encrypting communication between nodes in the cluster.\n- `frontend`: Configuration for encrypting the Frontend's public endpoints.\n\nA customized configuration can be passed using either the [WithConfig](/references/server-options#withconfig) or [WithConfigLoader](/references/server-options#withconfigloader) Server options.\n\nSee [TLS configuration reference](/references/configuration/#tls) for more details.\n\n### Authentication\n\nThere are a few authentication protocols available to prevent unwanted access such as authentication of servers, clients, and users.\n\n### Servers\n\nTo prevent spoofing and [MITM attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) you can specify the `serverName` in the `client` section of your respective mTLS configuration.\nThis enables established connections to authenticate the endpoint, ensuring that the server certificate presented to any connecting Client has the appropriate server name in its CN property.\nIt can be used for both `internode` and `frontend` endpoints.\n\nMore guidance on mTLS setup can be found in [the `samples-server` repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/main/tls) and you can reach out to us for further guidance.\n\n### Client connections\n\nTo restrict a client's network access to cluster endpoints you can limit it to clients with certificates issued by a specific Certificate Authority (CA).\nUse the `clientCAFiles`/ `clientCAData` and `requireClientAuth` properties in both the `internode` and `frontend` sections of the [mTLS configuration](/references/configuration/#tls).\n\n### Users\n\nTo restrict access to specific users, authentication and authorization is performed through extensibility points and plugins as described in the [Authorization](#authorization) section below.\n\n#### Authorization\n\n:::note\nInformation regarding [`Authorizer`](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin) and [`ClaimMapper`](/concepts/what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin) has been moved to another location.\n:::\n\nTemporal offers two plugin interfaces for implementing API call authorization:\n\n- [`ClaimMapper`](/concepts/what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin)\n- [`Authorizer`](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin)\n\nThe authorization and claim mapping logic is customizable, making it available to a variety of use cases and identity schemes.\nWhen these are provided the frontend invokes the implementation of these interfaces before executing the requested operation.\n\nSee https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/blob/main/extensibility/authorizer for a sample implementation.\n\n![](/img/docs/frontend-authorization-order-of-operations.png)\n\n### Single sign-on integration\n\nTemporal can be integrated with a single sign-on (SSO) experience by utilizing the `ClaimMapper` and `Authorizer` plugins.\nThe default JWT `ClaimMapper` implementation can be used as is or as a base for a custom implementation of a similar plugin.\n\n#### Temporal Web\n\nTo enable SSO for the Temporal Web UI edit the web service's configuration per the [Temporal Web README](https://github.com/temporalio/web#configuring-authentication-optional).\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"concepts/what-is-a-data-converter","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-data-converter.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-data-converter","title":"What

Converter","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that encodes and decodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Server.\n\n- TypeScript: [Data Converters](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/data-converters)\n- Go: [Create a custom Data Converter](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/go/how-to-create-a-custom-data-converter-in-go)\n\n![Data Converter encodes and decodes data](/diagrams/default-data-converter.svg)\n\nData is encoded before it is sent to a Temporal Server, and it is decoded when it is received from a Temporal Server.\n\nThe main pieces of data that run through the Data Converter are arguments and return values:\n\n- The Client:\n  - Encodes Workflow, Signal, and Query arguments.\n  - Decodes Workflow and Query return values.\n- The Worker:\n  - Decodes Workflow, Signal, and Query arguments.\n  - Encodes Workflow and Query return values.\n  - Decodes and encodes Activity arguments and return values.\n\nEach piece of data (like a single argument or return value) is encoded as a [`Payload`](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.common.v1.Payload) Protobuf message, which consists of binary `data` and key-value `metadata`.\n\n## Default Data Converter\n\nEach Temporal SDK includes a default Data Converter.\nIn most SDKs, the default converter supports binary, JSON, and Protobufs.\n(In SDKs that cannot determine parameter types at runtime—like TypeScript—Protobufs aren't included in the default converter.)\nIt tries to encode values in the following order:\n\n- Null\n- Binary\n- Protobuf JSON\n- JSON\n\nFor example:\n\n- If a value is an instance of a Protobuf message, it will be encoded with [proto3 JSON](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).\n- If a value isn't null, binary, or a Protobuf, it will be encoded as JSON. If any part of it is not serializable as JSON (for example, a Date—see [JSON data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types)), an error will be thrown.\n\nThe default converter also supports decoding binary Protobufs.\n\n## Custom Data Converter\n\nApplications can create their own custom Data Converters to alter the format (for example using [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) instead of JSON) or add compression or encryption.\n\nTo use a custom Data Converter, provide it in the following contexts:\n\n- The Client and Worker in the SDKs you use.\n- Temporal Web via [`tctl data-converter web`](/tctl-v1/dataconverter#web) (for displaying decoded data in the Web UI).\n- `tctl` via [`--data-converter-plugin`](/tctl-next/#--data-converter-plugin) (for displaying decoded headers in `tctl` output).\n\nCustom Data Converters are not applied to all data:\n\n- `searchAttributes` are always encoded with JSON.\n- Headers are not encoded by the SDK (the one exception will be—when implemented—the SDK [running OTel baggage through custom Codecs](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/514)).\n\nA custom Data Converter has three parts:\n\n- [Payload Converter](#payload-converter)\n- [Payload Codec](#payload-codec)\n- [Failure Converter](#failure-converter)\n\n### Payload Converter\n\nSome SDKs have the concept of a Payload Converter that's part of the Data Converter and does the conversion from a value to a Payload and back.\n\n### Payload Codec\n\nIn [TypeScript](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/data-converters#custom-data-converter), [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#PayloadCodec), and [Python](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.converter.DataConverter.html), data conversion happens in two stages:\n\n1. A Payload Converter converts a value into a [`Payload`](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.common.v1.Payload).\n2. A Payload Codec transforms an array of Payloads (for example, a list of Workflow arguments) into another array of Payloads.\n\nThe Payload Codec is an optional step that happens between the wire and the Payload Converter:\n\n```\nTemporal Server <--> Wire <--> Payload Codec <--> Payload Converter <--> User code\n```\n\nCommon Payload Codec transformations are compression and encryption.\n\nIn codec implementations, we recommended running the function (whether it be compressing, encrypting, etc) on the entire input Payload, and putting the result in a new Payload's `data` field. That way, the input Payload's headers are preserved. See, for example:\n\n- [`ZlibCodec`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/706516c7077ba2e9b40304aeddbed47e25b2a68f/converter/codec.go#L77-L105) in the Go SDK\n- [Encryption Data Converter](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/15be864c80d4d983ebb8a8fbd3fa5263bcef6930/encryption/data_converter.go#L100-L126) in Go's encryption sample\n\nTo view data that's been converted by a codec in the Web UI and tctl, use a [Codec Server](/security#codec-server).\n\n#### Encryption\n\nDoing encryption in a custom Data Converter ensures that all application data is encrypted during the following actions:\n\n- Being sent to/from Temporal Server.\n- Moving inside Temporal Server.\n- Stored by Temporal Server.\n\nThen data exists unencrypted in memory only on the Client and in the Worker Process that is executing Workflows and Activities on hosts that the application developer controls.\n\nOur encryption samples use AES GCM with 256-bit keys:\n\n- [TypeScript sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/encryption)\n- [Go sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/encryption)\n- [Python sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/tree/main/encryption)\n- [Java sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/main/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/encryptedpayloads)\n\n### Failure Converter\n\nA Failure Converter converts error objects to proto [Failures](/temporal#failure) and back.\n\nThe default Failure Converter copies error messages and stack traces as plain text.\nIf your errors may contain sensitive information, you can encrypt the message and stack trace by configuring the default Failure Converter to use your [Payload Codec](#payload-codec), in which case it will move your `message` and `stack_trace` fields to a Payload that's run through your codec.\n\nYou can make a custom Failure Converter, but if you use multiple SDKs, you'd have to implement the same logic in each.\n\n- TypeScript: [`DefaultFailureConverter`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.DefaultFailureConverter)\n- Go:

method `GetClaims`, which translates `AuthInfo` structs from the caller into `Claims` about the caller's roles within Temporal.\n\nA `Role` (within Temporal) is a bit mask that combines one or more of the role constants.\nIn the following example, the role is assigned constants that allow the caller to read and write information.\n\n```go\nrole := authorization.RoleReader | authorization.RoleWriter\n```\n\n`GetClaims` is customizable and can be modified with the `temporal.WithClaimMapper` server option.\nTemporal also offers a default JWT `ClaimMapper` for your use.\n\nA typical approach is for `ClaimMapper` to interpret custom `Claims` from a caller's JWT, such as membership in groups, and map them to Temporal roles for the user.\nThe subject information from the caller's mTLS certificate can also be a parameter in determining roles.\n\n#### `AuthInfo`\n\n`AuthInfo` is a struct that is passed to `GetClaims`. `AuthInfo` contains an authorization token extracted

information about permission claims granted to the caller.\n\n`Authorizer` assumes that the caller has been properly authenticated, and trusts the `Claims` when making an authorization decision.\n\n#### Default JWT ClaimMapper\n\nTemporal offers a default JWT `ClaimMapper` that extracts the information needed to form Temporal `Claims`.\nThis plugin requires a public key to validate digital signatures.\n\nTo get an instance of the default JWT `ClaimMapper`, call `NewDefaultJWTClaimMapper` and provide it with the following:\n\n- a `TokenKeyProvider` instance\n- a `config.Authorization` pointer\n- a logger\n\nThe code for the default `ClaimMapper` can also be used to build a custom `ClaimMapper`.\n\n#### Token key provider\n\nA `TokenKeyProvider` obtains public keys from specified issuers' URIs that adhere to a specific format.\nThe default JWT `ClaimMapper` uses this component to obtain and refresh public keys over time.\n\nTemporal provides an `rsaTokenKeyProvider`.\nThis component dynamically obtains public keys that follow the [JWKS format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).\n`rsaTokenKeyProvider` uses only the `RSAKey` and `Close` methods.\n\n```go\nprovider := authorization.NewRSAKeyProvider(cfg)\n```\n\n:::note\n\n`KeySourceURIs` are the HTTP endpoints that return public keys of token issuers in the [JWKS format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).\n`RefreshInterval` defines how frequently keys should be refreshed.\nFor example, [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) exposes endpoints such as `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/.well-known/jwks.json`.\n\n:::\n\nBy default, \"permissions\" is used to name the `permissionsClaimName` value.\n\nConfigure the plugin with `config.Config.Global.Authorization.JWTKeyProvider`.\n\n#### JSON Web Token format\n\nThe default JWT `ClaimMapper` expects authorization tokens to be formatted as follows:\n\n```\nBearer <token>\n```\n\nThe Permissions Claim in the JWT Token is expected to be a collection of Individual Permission Claims.\nEach Individual Permission Claim must be formatted as follows:\n\n```\n<namespace> : <permission>\n```\n\nThese permissions are then converted into Temporal roles for the caller.\nThis can be one of Temporal's four values:\n\n- read\n- write\n- worker\n- admin\n\nMultiple permissions for the same Namespace are overridden by the `ClaimMapper`.\n\n##### Example of a payload for the default JWT ClaimMapper\n\n```\n{\n   \"permissions\":[\n      \"system:read\",\n      \"namespace1:write\"\n   ],\n   \"aud\":[\n      \"audience\"\n   ],\n   \"exp\":1630295722,\n

Execution state and metadata for debugging purposes.\nIt ships with every [Docker Compose](/application-development/foundations#docker-compose) update and is available with [Temporal Cloud](/cloud).\n\nYou can configure the Temporal Web UI to work in your own environment.\nSee the [UI configuration reference](/references/web-ui-configuration).\n\nWeb UI open source repos:\n\n- [temporalio/ui](https://github.com/temporalio/ui)\n- [temporalio/ui-server](https://github.com/temporalio/ui-server)\n\nThe Web UI is packed with several features.\n\n### Namespace selection\n\nYou can search for or select a Namespace by using the Namespace Switcher, located in the left navigational menu.\nAfter you select a Namespace, the Web UI shows the Recent Workflows page for that Namespace.\nIn Temporal Cloud, users can access only the Namespaces that they have been granted access to.\n\n### Recent Workflows\n\nRecent Workflows lists all Workflow Executions run in the past 24 hours.\nThe default number shown is 1,000 Workflow Executions.\n\nUsers can list Workflow Executions by any of the following:\n\n- Status\n- [Workflow ID](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id)\n- [Workflow Type](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type)\n- Start time\n- End time\n- A [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter)\n\nFor start time and end time, users can set their preferred date and time format as one of the following:\n\n- UTC\n- Local\n- Relative\n\nSelect a Workflow Execution to view the Workflow Execution's History, Workers, and pending Activities.\n\n#### History\n\nThis is a view of the [Events](/concepts/what-is-an-event) and Event fields within the Workflow Execution.\nApproximately [40 different Events](/references/events) can appear in a Workflow Execution's Event History.\n\nThe top of the page lists the following execution metadata:\n\n- [Workflow Type](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type)\n- [Run ID](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id)\n- Start Time and Close Time\n- [Task Queue](/concepts/what-is-a-task-queue)\n- Parent and Parent ID\n- State Transitions\n\nThe Input and Results section displays the function arguments and return values for debugging purposes.\nResults are not available until the Workflow finishes.\n\nThe Recent Events tab has the following views:\n\n- Timeline: A chronological or reverse-chronological order of events with a summary.\n  Clicking into an Event displays all details for that Event.\n  Clicking “Expand all” displays all Event details.\n  Similarly, clicking “Collapse all” collapses the table and displays only the summary.\n- Compact: A logical grouping of Activities, Signals and Timers.\n- JSON: The full JSON code for the workflow.\n\n#### Download Event History\n\nThe entire Workflow Execution Event History, in JSON format, can be downloaded from this section.\n\n#### Terminate Workflow\n\nWorkflow Executions can be Terminated directly from the UI.\nA custom note can be logged from the UI when that happens.\n\n#### Workers\n\nDisplays the Workers currently polling on the Workflow Task Queue with a count.\nIf no Workers are polling, an error displays.\n\n#### Pending Activities\n\nDisplays a summary of recently active and/or pending Activity Executions.\nClicking a pending Activity directs the user to the Pending Activities tab to view details.\n\n#### Stack Trace\n\nThe screen shows the captured result from the [\\_\\_stack_trace](/workflows#stack-trace-query) Query.\nThe Query is performed when the tab is selected.\nIt works only if a Worker is running and available to return the stack trace.\n\n#### Queries\n\nLists all Queries sent to the Workflow Execution.\n\n### Settings\n\nDisplays the following information:\n\n- Description of the Namespace.\n- Owner: Namespace owner.\n- Global?: Whether the Namespace is a Global Namespace\n- Retention Period: Namespace Retention Period\n- History Archival: Whether History Archival is enabled\n- Visibility Archival: Whether Visibility Archival is enabled\n- Failover Version: Namespace Failover Version\n- Clusters: Cluster information\n\n### Archival\n\n[Archival](/concepts/what-is-archival) feature information.\n\n###

though it is installed locally (such as `tctl namespace describe`), set an alias: `alias tctl=\"docker exec temporal-admin-tools tctl\"`\n- Run the [temporal-admin-tools](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/admin-tools) Docker image:\n  - On Linux: `docker run --rm -it --entrypoint tctl --network host --env TEMPORAL_CLI_ADDRESS=localhost:7233

Temporal Server is running on a remote host, change the value of `TEMPORAL_CLI_ADDRESS`.\n  - To simplify command lines, create a `tctl` alias.\n- Build it locally:\n  1. Clone the [Temporal Server repo](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal).\n  1. Run `make tctl`.\n  1. Copy the `tctl` executable to any directory that appears in the `PATH` environment variable; for example, `/usr/bin/`.\n- Install the latest version of the tctl in your `GOPATH`: `go install

as calling another service, transcoding a media file, or sending an email message.\n\nWorkflow code orchestrates the execution of Activities, persisting the results.\nIf an Activity Function Execution fails, any future execution starts from initial state (except Heartbeats).\nTherefore, an Activity function is allowed to contain any code without restrictions.\n\nActivity Functions are executed by

Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution).\n\n- [How to develop an Activity Definition](/application-development/foundations#develop-activities)\n\nThe term 'Activity Definition' is used to refer to the full set of primitives in any given language SDK that provides an access point to an Activity Function Definition——the method or function that is invoked for an [Activity Task Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution).\nTherefore, the terms Activity Function and Activity Method refer to the source of an instance of an execution.\n\nActivity Definitions are named and referenced in code by their [Activity Type](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-type).\n\n![Activity Definition](/diagrams/activity-definition.svg)\n\n#### Idempotency\n\nTemporal recommends that Activities be idempotent.\n\nAn Activity is idempotent if multiple [Activity Task Executions](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution) do not change the state of the system beyond the first Activity Task Execution.\n\nWe recommend using idempotency keys for critical side effects.\n\nThe lack of idempotency might affect the correctness of your application but does not affect the Temporal Platform.\nIn other words, lack of idempotency does not lead to a platform error.\n\nIn some cases, whether something is idempotent does not affect the correctness of an application.\nFor example, if you have a monotonically incrementing counter, you might not care that retries increment the counter because you don’t care about the actual value, only that the current value is greater than a previous value.\n\n#### Constraints\n\nActivity Definitions are executed as normal functions.\n\nIn the event of failure, the function begins at its initial state when retried (except when Activity Heartbeats are established).\n\nTherefore, an Activity Definition has no restrictions on the code it contains.\n\n#### Parameters\n\nAn Activity Definition can support as many parameters as needed.\n\nAll values passed through these parameters are recorded in the [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history) of the Workflow Execution.\nReturn values are also captured in the Event History for the calling Workflow Execution.\n\nActivity Definitions must contain the following parameters:\n\n- Context: an optional parameter that provides Activity context within multiple APIs.\n- Heartbeat: a notification from the Worker to the Temporal Cluster that the Activity Execution is progressing. Cancelations are allowed only if the Activity Definition permits Heartbeating.\n- Timeouts: intervals that control the execution and retrying of Activity Task Executions.\n\nOther parameters, such as [Retry Policies](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy) and return values, can be seen in the implementation guides, listed in the next section.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-type","node":{"file_name":"what-is-an-activity-type.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-an-activity-type.md","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-type","title":"What is an Activity Type?","description":"An Activity Type is the mapping of a name to an Activity Definition.","label":"Activity Type","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAn Activity Type is the mapping of a name to an Activity Definition.\n\nActivity Types are scoped through Task Queues.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution","node":{"file_name":"what-is-an-activity-execution.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution.md","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution","title":"What is an Activity Execution?","description":"An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.","label":"Activity Execution","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAn Activity Execution is the full chain of [Activity Task Executions](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution).\n\n- [How to spawn an Activity Execution](/application-development/foundations#activity-execution)\n\n![Activity Execution](/diagrams/activity-execution.svg)\n\nBy default, an Activity Execution has no time limit.\nActivity Execution [timeouts](/application-development/features#activity-timeouts) and [retry policies](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy) can be customized.\n\nIf an Activity Execution fails (because it exhausted all retries, threw a [non-retryable error](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy#non-retryable-errors), or was canceled), the error is returned to the [Workflow](/workflows), which decides how to handle it.\n\n### Cancellation\n\nActivity Cancellation:\n\n- lets the Activity know it doesn't need to keep doing work, and\n- gives the Activity time to clean up any resources it has created.\n\nActivities can only receive Cancellation if they emit Heartbeats or in Core-based SDKs (TypeScript/Python) are Local Activities (which don't heartbeat but receive Cancellation anyway).\n\nAn Activity may receive Cancellation if:\n\n- The Activity was requested to be Cancelled. This can often cascade from Workflow Cancellation, but not always—SDKs have ways to stop Cancellation from cascading. <!-- TODO link to workflow cancellation -->\n- The Activity was considered failed by the Server because any of the Activity timeouts have triggered (for example, the Server didn't receive a heartbeat within the Activity's Heartbeat timeout). The [Cancelled Failure](/kb/failures#cancelled-failure) that the Activity receives will have `message: 'TIMED_OUT'`.\n- The Workflow Run reached a [Closed state](/workflows#status), in which case the Cancelled Failure will have `message: 'NOT_FOUND'`.\n- In some SDKs:\n  - The Worker is shutting down.\n  - An Activity sends a Heartbeat but the Heartbeat details can't be converted by the Worker's configured [Data Converter](/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter). This fails the Activity Task Execution with an Application Failure.\n\nThere are different ways to receive Cancellation depending on the SDK. <!-- TODO link to dev guide -->\nAn Activity may accept or ignore Cancellation:\n\n- To allow Cancellation to happen, let the Cancellation Failure propagate.\n- To ignore Cancellation, catch it and continue executing.\n\nSome SDKs have ways to shield tasks from being stopped while still letting the Cancellation propagate.\n\nThe Workflow can also decide if it wants to wait for the Activity Cancellation to be accepted or to proceed without waiting.\n\nCancellation can only be requested a single time.\nIf you try to cancel your Activity Execution more than once, it will not receive more than one Cancellation request.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-id","node":{"file_name":"what-is-an-activity-id.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-an-activity-id.md","id":"concepts/what-is-an-activity-id","title":"What is an Activity Id?","description":"A unique identifier for an Activity Execution.","label":"Activity Id","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nThe identifier for an [Activity Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution).\nThe identifier can be generated by the system, or it can be provided by the Workflow code that spawns the Activity Execution.\nThe identifier is unique among the open Activity Executions of a [Workflow Run](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id).\n(A single Workflow Run may reuse an Activity Id if an earlier Activity Execution with the same Id has closed.)\n\nAn Activity Id can be used to [complete the Activity asynchronously](/concepts/what-is-asynchronous-activity-completion).\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-a-schedule-to-start-timeout","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-schedule-to-start-timeout.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-schedule-to-start-timeout.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-schedule-to-start-timeout","title":"What is a Schedule-To-Start Timeout?","description":"A Schedule-To-Start Timeout is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an Activity Task is placed in a Task Queue to when a Worker picks it up from the Task Queue.","label":"Schedule-To-Start Timeout","tags":["term","explanation","timeouts"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Schedule-To-Start Timeout is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task) is scheduled (that is, placed in a Task Queue) to when a [Worker](/concepts/what-is-a-worker) starts (that is, picks up from the Task Queue) that Activity Task.\nIn other words, it's a limit for how long an Activity Task can be enqueued.\n\n[How to set a Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/app-dev-context/activity-retries)\n\nThe moment that the Task is picked by the Worker from the Task Queue is considered to be the start of the Activity Task for the purposes of the Schedule-To-Start Timeout and associated metrics.\nThis definition of \"Start\" avoids issues that a clock difference between the Temporal Cluster and a Worker might create.\n\n![Schedule-To-Start Timeout period](/diagrams/schedule-to-start-timeout.svg)\n\n\"Schedule\" in Schedule-To-Start and Schedule-To-Close have different frequency guarantees.\n\nThe Schedule-To-Start Timeout is enforced for each Activity Task, whereas the Schedule-To-Close Timeout is enforced once per Activity Execution.\nThus, \"Schedule\" in Schedule-To-Start refers to the scheduling moment of _every_ Activity Task in the sequence of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution, while\n\"Schedule\" in Schedule-To-Close refers to the _first_ Activity Task in that sequence.\n\nA [Retry Policy](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy) attached to an Activity Execution retries an Activity Task.\n\n![Start-To-Close Timeout period with retries](/diagrams/schedule-to-start-timeout-with-retry.svg)\n\nThis timeout has two primary use cases:\n\n1.

Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.\nHeartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.\n\n#### Throttling\n\nHeartbeats may not always be sent to the Cluster—they may be throttled by the Worker.\nThe throttle interval is the smaller of the following:\n\n- If `heartbeatTimeout` is provided, `heartbeatTimeout * 0.8`; otherwise, `defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval`\n- `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval`\n\n`defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval` is 30 seconds by default, and `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval` is 60 seconds by default.\nEach can be set in Worker options.\n\nThrottling is implemented as follows:\n\n- After sending a Heartbeat, the Worker sets a timer for the throttle interval.\n- The Worker stops sending Heartbeats, but continues receiving Heartbeats from the Activity and remembers the most recent one.\n- When the timer fires, the Worker:\n  - Sends the most recent Heartbeat.\n  - Sets the timer again.\n\n#### Which Activities should Heartbeat?\n\nHeartbeating is best thought about not in terms of time, but in terms of \"How do you know you are making progress?\"\nFor short-term operations, progress updates are not a requirement.\nHowever, checking the progress and status of Activity Executions that run over long periods is almost always useful.\n\nConsider the following when setting Activity Hearbeats:\n\n- Your underlying task must be able to report definite progress.\n  Note that your Workflow cannot read this progress information while the Activity is still executing (or it would have to store it in Event History).\n  You can report progress to external sources if you need it exposed to the user.\n\n- Your Activity Execution is long-running, and you need to verify whether the Worker that is processing your Activity is still alive and has not run out of memory or silently crashed.\n\nFor example, the following scenarios are suitable for Heartbeating:\n\n- Reading a large file from Amazon S3.\n- Running a ML training job on some local GPUs.\n\nAnd the following scenarios are not suitable for Heartbeating:\n\n- Making a quick API call.\n- Reading a small file from disk.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout","title":"What

[Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) that spawns it.\n\nSome Activity Executions are very short-living and do not need the queuing semantic, flow control, rate limiting, and routing capabilities.\nFor this case, Temporal supports the Local Activity feature.\n\nThe main benefit of Local Activities is that they use less Temporal Cluster resources (for example, fewer History events) and have much lower latency overhead (because no need to roundtrip to the Cluster) compared to normal Activity Executions.\nHowever, Local Activities are subject to shorter durations and a lack of rate limiting.\n\nConsider using Local Activities for functions that are the following:\n\n- can be implemented in the same binary as the Workflow that calls them.\n- do not require global rate limiting.\n- do not require routing to a specific Worker or Worker pool.\n- no longer than a few seconds, inclusive of retries.\n\nIf it takes longer than 80% of the Workflow Task Timeout (which is 10 seconds by default), the Worker will ask the Cluster to create a new Workflow Task to extend the \"lease\" for processing the Local Activity.\nThe Worker will continue doing so until the Local Activity has completed.\nThis is called Workflow Task Heartbeating.\nThe drawbacks of long-running Local Activities are:\n\n- Each new Workflow Task results in 3 more Events in History.\n- The Workflow won't get notified of new events like Signals and completions until the next Workflow Task Heartbeat.\n- New Commands created by the Workflow concurrently with the Local Activity will not be sent to the Cluster until either the Local Activity completes or the next Workflow Task Heartbeat.\n\nUsing a Local Activity without understanding its limitations can cause various production issues.\n**We recommend using regular Activities unless your use case requires very high throughput and large Activity fan outs of very short-lived Activities.**\nMore guidance in choosing between

as long as you can upgrade your database according to each project's specifications, Temporal should work with any version within supported ranges.\n- We do not run tests with vendors like Vitess and CockroachDB, so you rely on their compatibility claims if you use them.\n  Feel free to discuss them with fellow users [in our forum](https://community.temporal.io/).\n- Temporal is [working on official SQLite v3.x persistence](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+sqlite), but this is meant only for development and testing, not production usage.\n  Cassandra, MySQL, and PostgreSQL schemas are supported and thus can be used as the Server's database.\n\n### Monitoring and observation\n\nTemporal emits metrics by default in a format that is supported by Prometheus.\nMonitoring and observing those metrics is optional.\nAny metrics software that supports the same format can be used. Currently, we test with the following Prometheus and Grafana versions:\n\n- **Prometheus >= v2.0**\n- **Grafana >= v2.5**\n\n### Visibility\n\nTemporal has built-in [Visibility](/concepts/what-is-visibility) features.\nTo enhance this feature, Temporal supports an [integration with Elasticsearch](/clusters/how-to-integrate-elasticsearch-into-a-temporal-cluster).\n\n- Elasticsearch v8 is supported from Temporal version 1.18.0 onwards\n- Elasticsearch v7.10 is supported from Temporal version 1.7.0 onwards\n- Elasticsearch v6.8 is supported up to Temporal version 1.17.x\n- Elasticsearch v6.8 and v7.10 versions are explicitly supported with AWS Elasticsearch\n\n### mTLS encryption\n\nTemporal supports Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) as a method of encrypting network traffic between services within a Temporal Cluster, or between application processes and a Cluster.\n\nMutual TLS can be enabled in Temporal’s [TLS configuration](/references/configuration#tls).\nThis configuration can be passed through `WithConfig` or `WithConfigLoader`.\n\nThis configuration includes two sections that serve to separate intra-cluster and external traffic. That way, different certificates and settings can be used to encrypt each section of traffic:\n\n- `internode`: configuration for encrypting communication between nodes within the Cluster.\n- `frontend`: configuration for encrypting the Frontend's public endpoints\n\n### Temporal Client connections\n\nA client's network access can be limited by using certificates issued by a specific Certificate Authority (CA).\n\nTo restrict access to Temporal Cluster endpoints, use the `clientCAFiles` or `clientCAData` property and the `requireClientAuth` property.\nThese properties can be specified in both the `internode` and `frontend` sections of the [mTLS configuration](/references/configuration#tls).\n\n#### Server name specification\n\nSpecify the `serverName` in the `client` section of your mTLS configuration to prevent spoofing and [MITM attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).\n\nEntering a value for `serverName` enables established connections to authenticate the endpoint.\nThis ensures that the server certificate presented to any connected client has the specified server name in its CN property.\n\nThis measure can be used for `internode` and `frontend` endpoints.\n\nFor more information on mTLS configuration, refer to our [TLS configuration guide](/references/configuration#tls).\n\n### Auth\n\n**Authentication** is the process of verifying users who want to access your application are actually the users you want accessing it.\n**Authorization** is the verification of applications and data that a user on your Cluster or application has access to.\n\nTemporal has several authentication protocols that can be set to restrict access to your data.\nThese protocols address three areas: servers, client connections, and users.\n\nServer attacks can be prevented by specifying `serverName` in the `client` section of your mTLS configuration.\nThis can be done for both `frontend` and `internode` endpoints.\n\nClient connections can be restricted to certain endpoints by requiring certificates from a specific CA.\nModify the `clientCaFiles`, `clientCaData`, and `requireClientAuth` properties in the `internode` and `frontend` sections of the mTLS configuration.\n\nUser access can be restricted through extensibility points and plugins.\nWhen implemented, the `frontend` invokes the plugin before executing the requested operation.\n\nTemporal offers two plugin interfaces for API call authentication and authorization.\n\n- [`ClaimMapper`](/concepts/what-is-a-claimmapper-plugin)\n- [`Authorizer`](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin)\n\nThe logic of both plugins can be customized to fit a variety of use cases.\nWhen provided, the frontend invokes the implementation of the plugins before running the requested operation.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"concepts/what-is-the-temporal-server","node":{"file_name":"what-is-the-temporal-server.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-the-temporal-server.md","id":"concepts/what-is-the-temporal-server","title":"What is the Temporal Server?","description":"The Temporal Server is a grouping of four horizontally scalable services.","label":"Temporal Server","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nThe Temporal Server consists of four independently scalable services:\n\n- Frontend gateway: for rate limiting, routing, authorizing.\n- History subsystem: maintains data (mutable state, queues, and timers).\n- Matching subsystem: hosts Task Queues for dispatching.\n- Worker Service: for internal background Workflows.\n\nFor example, a real-life production deployment can have 5 Frontend, 15 History, 17 Matching, and 3 Worker Services per cluster.\n\nThe Temporal Server services can run independently or be grouped together into shared processes on one or more physical or virtual machines.\nFor live (production) environments, we recommend that each service runs independently, because each one has different scaling requirements and troubleshooting becomes easier.\nThe History, Matching, and Worker Services can scale horizontally within a Cluster.\nThe Frontend Service scales differently than the others because it has no sharding or partitioning;

measured.\n\nEach History Shard maps to a single persistence partition.\nA History Shard assumes that only be one concurrent operation can be within a partition at a time.\nIn essence, the number of History Shards represents the number of concurrent database operations that can occur for a Cluster.\nThis means that the number of History Shards in a Temporal Cluster plays a significant role in the performance of your Temporal Application.\n\nBefore integrating a database, the total number of History Shards for the Temporal Cluster must be chosen and set in the Cluster's configuration (see [persistence](/references/configuration#persistence)).\nAfter the Shard count is configured and the database integrated, the total number of History Shards for the Cluster cannot be changed.\n\nIn theory, a Temporal Cluster can operate with an unlimited number of History Shards, but each History Shard adds compute overhead to the Cluster.\nTemporal Clusters have operated successfully using anywhere from 1 to 128K History Shards, with each Shard responsible for tens of thousands of Workflow Executions.\nOne Shard is useful only in small scale setups designed for testing, while 128k

Executions from active Clusters to other passive Clusters, for backup and state reconstruction.\nWhen necessary, for higher availability, Cluster operators can failover to any of the backup Clusters.\n\nTemporal's Multi-Cluster Replication feature is considered **experimental** and not subject to normal [versioning and support policy](/clusters).\n\nTemporal automatically forwards Start, Signal, and Query requests to the active Cluster.\nThis feature must be enabled through a Dynamic Config flag per [Global Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-global-namespace).\n\nWhen the feature is enabled, Tasks are sent to the Parent Task Queue partition that matches that Namespace, if it exists.\n\nAll Visibility APIs can be used against active and standby Clusters.\nThis enables [Temporal Web](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-web) to work seamlessly for Global Namespaces.\nApplications making API calls directly to the Temporal Visibility API continue to work even if a Global Namespace is in standby mode.\nHowever, they might see a lag due to replication delay when querying the Workflow Execution state from a standby Cluster.\n\n#### Namespace Versions\n\nA _version_ is a concept in Multi-Cluster Replication that describes the chronological order of events per Namespace.\n\nWith Multi-Cluster Replication, all Namespace change events and Workflow Execution History events are replicated asynchronously for high throughput.\nThis means that data across clusters is **not** strongly consistent.\nTo guarantee that Namespace data and Workflow Execution data will achieve eventual consistency (especially when there is a data conflict during a failover), a **version** is introduced and attached to Namespaces.\nAll Workflow Execution History entries generated in a Namespace will also come with the version attached to that Namespace.\n\nAll participating Clusters are pre-configured with a unique initial version and a shared version increment:\n\n- `initial version < shared version increment`\n\nWhen performing failover for a Namespace from one Cluster to another Cluster, the version attached to the Namespace will be changed by the following rule:\n\n- for all versions which follow `version % (shared version increment) == (active cluster's initial version)`, find the smallest version which has `version >= old version in namespace`\n\nWhen there is a data conflict, a comparison will be made and Workflow Execution History entries with the highest version will be considered the source of truth.\n\nWhen a cluster is trying to mutate a Workflow Execution History, the version will be checked.\nA cluster can mutate a Workflow Execution History only if the following is true:\n\n- The version in the Namespace belongs to this cluster, i.e.\n  `(version in namespace) % (shared version increment) == (this cluster's initial version)`\n- The version of this Workflow Execution History's last entry (event) is equal or less than the version in the Namespace, i.e.\n  `(last event's version) <= (version in namespace)`\n\n<details>\n<summary>Namespace version change example\n</summary>\n\nAssuming the following scenario:\n\n- Cluster A comes with initial version: 1\n- Cluster B comes with initial version: 2\n- Shared version increment: 10\n\nT = 0: Namespace α is registered, with active Cluster set to Cluster A\n\n```\nnamespace α's version is 1\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 1\n```\n\nT = 1: namespace β is registered, with active Cluster set to Cluster B\n\n```\nnamespace β's version is 2\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 2\n```\n\nT = 2: Namespace α is updated to with active Cluster set to Cluster B\n\n```\nnamespace α's version is 2\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 2\n```\n\nT = 3: Namespace β is updated to with active Cluster set to Cluster A\n\n```\nnamespace β's version is 11\nall workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 11\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### Version history\n\nVersion history is a concept which provides a high level summary of version information in regards to Workflow Execution History.\n\nWhenever there is a new Workflow Execution History entry generated, the version from Namespace will be attached.\nThe Workflow Executions's mutable state will keep track of all history entries (events) and the corresponding version.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Version history example (without data conflict)\n</summary>\n\n-

Execution History Events are modeled as a tree, as shown in the second example in [Version History](#version-history).\n\nWorkflow Execution Histories that diverge will have more than one history branch.\nAmong all history branches, the history branch with the highest version is considered the `current branch` and the Workflow Execution's mutable state is a summary of the current branch.\nWhenever there is a switch between Workflow Execution History branches, a complete rebuild of the Workflow Execution's mutable state will occur.\n\nTemporal Multi-Cluster Replication relies on asynchronous replication of Events across Clusters, so in the case of a failover it is possible to have an Activity Task dispatched again to the newly active Cluster due to a replication task lag.\nThis also means that whenever a Workflow Execution is updated after a failover by the new Cluster, any previous replication tasks for that Execution cannot be applied.\nThis results in loss of some progress made by the Workflow Execution in the previous active Cluster.\nDuring such conflict resolution, Temporal re-injects any external Events like Signals in the new Event History before discarding replication tasks.\nEven though some progress could roll back during failovers, Temporal provides the guarantee that Workflow Executions won’t get stuck and will continue to make forward progress.\n\nActivity Execution completions are not forwarded across Clusters.\nAny outstanding Activities will eventually time out based on the configuration.\nYour application should have retry logic in place so that the Activity gets retried and dispatched again to a Worker after the failover to the new Cluster.\nHandling this is similar to handling an Activity Task timeout caused by a Worker restarting.\n\n#### Zombie Workflows\n\nThere is an existing contract that for any Namespace and Workflow Id combination, there can be at most one run (Namespace + Workflow Id + Run Id) open / executing.\n\nMulti-cluster Replication aims to keep the Workflow Execution History as up-to-date as possible among all participating Clusters.\n\nDue to the nature of Multi-cluster Replication (for example, Workflow Execution History events are replicated asynchronously) different Runs (same Namespace and Workflow Id) can arrive at the target Cluster at different times, sometimes out of order, as shown below:\n\n```\n| ------------- |          | ------------- |          | ------------- |\n| Cluster A |  | Network Layer |  | Cluster B |\n| --------- || ------------- |          |

|\n| Cluster A |  | Network Layer |  | Cluster B |\n| --------- || ------------- |          | ------------- |\n```\n\nBecause Run 2 appears in Cluster B first, Run 1 cannot be replicated as \"runnable\" due to the rule `at most one Run open` (see above), thus the \"zombie\" Workflow Execution state is introduced.\nA \"zombie\" state is one in which a Workflow Execution which cannot be actively mutated by a Cluster (assuming the corresponding Namespace is active in this Cluster). A zombie Workflow Execution can only be changed by a replication Task.\n\nRun 1 will be replicated similar to Run 2, except when Run 1's execution will become a \"zombie\" before Run 1 reaches completion.\n\n#### Workflow Task processing\n\nIn the context of Multi-cluster Replication, a Workflow Execution's mutable state is an entity which tracks all pending tasks.\nPrior to the introduction of Multi-cluster Replication, Workflow Execution History entries (events) are from a single branch, and the Temporal Server will only append new entries (events) to the Workflow Execution History.\n\nAfter the introduction of Multi-cluster Replication, it is possible that a Workflow Execution can have multiple Workflow Execution History branches.\nTasks generated according to one history branch may become invalidated by switching history branches during conflict resolution.\n\nExample:\n\nT = 0: task A is generated according to Event Id: 4, version: 2\n\n```\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| Events   |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| Event ID | Event Version |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| 1        | 1             |\n| 2        | 1             |\n| 3        | 2             |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n|          |\n|          |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| Event ID | Event Version |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| 4        | 2             | <-- task A belongs to this event |\n| -------- | ------------- |\n```\n\nT = 1: conflict resolution happens, Workflow Execution's mutable state is rebuilt and history Event Id: 4, version: 3 is written down to persistence\n\n```\n| -------- | ------------- |\n| Events        |\n| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Event ID      | Event Version                                |\n| --------      | -------------                                |\n| 1             | 1                                            |\n| 2             | 1                                            |\n| 3             | 2                                            |\n| --------      | -------------                                |\n|               |\n| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n|               |\n| --------      | -------------                                |                                  | -------- | ------------- |\n| Event ID      | Event Version                                |                                  | Event ID | Event Version |\n| --------      | -------------                                |                                  | -------- | ------------- |\n| 4             | 2                                            | <-- task A belongs to this event | 4        | 3             | <-- current branch / mutable state |\n| --------      | -------------                                |                                  | -------- | ------------- |\n```\n\nT = 2: task A is loaded.\n\nAt this time, due to the rebuild of a Workflow Execution's mutable state (conflict resolution), Task A is no longer relevant (Task A's corresponding Event belongs to non-current branch).\nTask processing logic will verify both the Event Id and version of the Task against a corresponding Workflow Execution's mutable state, then discard task A.\n","is_empty":false}}]},{"file_name":"namespaces.md","id":"namespaces","file_dir":"/","title":"Namespaces","sidebar_label":"Namespaces","description":"This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Namespaces.","use_description":true,"toc_max_heading_level":4,"add_tabs_support":false,"sections":[{"type":"p","id":"concepts/what-is-a-namespace","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-namespace.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-namespace.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-namespace","title":"What is a Namespace?","description":"A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform","label":"Namespace","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform.\n\nA single Namespace is still multi-tenant.\n\n### Usage\n\nNamespaces are created on the Temporal Cluster, and provide a range of controls to achieve isolation on Workflow Executions.\n\n- Namespaces are a mechanism for resource isolation. Heavy traffic from one Namespace will not impact other Namespaces running on the same Cluster.\n  For example, you can use Namespaces to match the development lifecycle by having separate `dev` and `prod` Namespaces.\n- If no other Namespace is specified, the Temporal Cluster uses the Namespace \"default\" for all Temporal SDKs and tctl.\n  See the [Registration](#registration) section for details.\n- Namespaces created on self-hosted Temporal Clusters are case-sensitive. For example, `foo` and `Foo` are two different Namespaces.\n  On Temporal Cloud, Namespaces are case-insensitive, and we recommend using lowercase for Namespace names to avoid potential issues.\n- **Membership**: [Task Queue](/concepts/what-is-a-task-queue) names and [Workflow Ids](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id) must all correspond to a specific Namespace.\n  For example, when a Workflow Execution is spawned, it does so within a specific Namespace.\n- **Uniqueness**: Temporal guarantees a unique Workflow Id within a Namespace.\n  Workflow Executions may have the same Workflow Id if they are in different Namespaces.\n- **Namespace Configuration**: Various configuration options like the [Retention Period](/concepts/what-is-a-retention-period) and the [Archival](/concepts/what-is-archival) destination are configured per Namespace through a special CRUD API or through [`tctl`](/tctl-v1/namespace).\n\n### Registration\n\nRegistering a Namespace creates the Namespace on the Temporal Cluster.\nWhen you register your Namespace, you must also set the [Retention Period](/concepts/what-is-a-retention-period) for the Namespace.\n\nOn Temporal Cloud, use the [Temporal Cloud UI](/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud) or [tcld commands](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to create and manage Namespaces.\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you can register your Namespaces using tctl (recommended) or programmatically using APIs. Note that these APIs and tctl commands will not work with Temporal Cloud.\n\nAll SDKs require a Namespace on the Temporal Cluster (or Temporal Cloud) for their Client calls. If not set using Client options, the Workflow Client API looks for the `default` Namespace. If there is no default Namespace registered with your Temporal Cluster (or Temporal Cloud), all calls will throw errors.\nYou must register your Namespace with the Temporal Cluster (or Temporal Cloud) before setting it in your Client.\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you can register your Namespaces in the following ways:\n\n- In your Cluster setup, create your Namespaces, including the default, in your setup script.\n  For example:\n\n  - If deploying through Docker Compose or using the [auto-setup image](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-builds/blob/main/docker/auto-setup.sh) in a custom Docker Compose application, the Namespace \"default\" is created, through the auto-setup script.\n  - If deploying through the [Temporal Helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts), you can create the \"default\" Namespace by using tctl; for example, `tctl --namespace default namespace register`.\n\n- Use the `tctl namespace register` command with the `--retention` modfiier to register your Namespaces, one at a time, and set the Retention Period on each.\n\n  - [How to register a new Namespace using tctl](/tctl-v1/namespace#register)\n  - [How to register a new Namespace using SDK](/app-dev-context/namespaces)\n\n- In your Client program, register your Namespace using `RegisterNamespaceRequest` API available in all the SDKs.\n\nNote that registering a Namespace takes up to 15 seconds to complete. Ensure that you are waiting for this process to complete before making calls to the Namespace.\n\n### Manage Namespaces\n\nUse a custom [Authorizer](/concepts/what-is-an-authorizer-plugin) on your Frontend Service in the Temporal Cluster to set restrictions on who can create, update, or deprecate Namespaces.\n\nOn Temporal Cloud, use the [Temporal Cloud UI](/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud) or [tcld commands](/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to manage Namespaces.\n\nOn self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you can manage your registered Namespaces using tctl (recommended) or programmatically using APIs. Note that these APIs and tctl commands will not work with Temporal Cloud.\n\n- Update information and configuration for a registered Namespace on your Temporal Cluster:\n\n  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace update`](/tctl-v1/namespace#update)\n  - Use the [`UpdateNamespace` API](/app-dev-context/namespaces) to update configuration on a Namespace.\n\n- Get details for a registered Namespace on your Temporal Cluster:\n\n  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace describe`](/tctl-v1/namespace#describe)\n  - Use the [`DescribeNamespace` API](/app-dev-context/namespaces) to return information and configuration details for a registered Namespace.\n\n- Get details for all registered Namespaces on your Temporal Cluster:\n\n  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace list`](/tctl-v1/namespace#list)\n  - Use the [`ListNamespace` API](/app-dev-context/namespaces) to return information and configuration details for all registered Namespaces on your Temporal Cluster.\n\n- Deprecate a Namespace: The [`DeprecateNamespace` API](/app-dev-context/namespaces) updates the state of a registered Namespace to \"DEPRECATED\". Once a Namespace is deprecated, you cannot start new Workflow Executions on it. All existing and running Workflow Executions on a deprecated Namespace will continue to run.\n\n- Delete a Namespace: Deletes a Namespace and all Workflow Executions on the Namespace. Note that this API is supported for Temporal Server version 1.17 and later.\n- With tctl: [`tctl namespace delete`](/tctl-next/namespace#delete). Note that this feature is only available in the [tctl v2.0.0-beta](/tctl-next/namespace#delete).\n- Use the [`DeleteNamespace` API](/app-dev-context/namespaces) to delete a registered Namespaces. All the running Workflow Executions on a deleted Namespace are also deleted.\n\n### Setting\n\nSet Namespaces in your SDK Client to isolate your Workflow Executions to the Namespace.\nIf you do not set a Namespace, all Workflow Executions started using the Client will be associated with the \"default\" Namespace. This means, you must have a default Namespace called \"default\" registered with your Temporal Cluster. See [Registration](#registration) for details.\n\n- [How to set the Namespace for a Temporal Client](/application-development/foundations#connect-to-a-cluster)\n- [How to list Namespaces in a Cluster using tctl](/tctl-v1/namespace#list)\n- [How to view (describe) Namespace metadata and details using tctl](/tctl-v1/namespace#describe)\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"concepts/what-is-a-global-namespace","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-global-namespace.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-global-namespace.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-global-namespace","title":"What is a Global Namespace?","description":"A Global Namespace is a Namespace that exists across Clusters when Multi-Cluster Replication is set up.","label":"Global Namespace","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Global Namespace is a [Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace) that exists across Clusters when [Multi-Cluster Replication](/concepts/what-is-multi-cluster-replication) is set up.\n\n- [How to register a Global Namespace](/tctl-v1/namespace#register)\n- [How to change the active Cluster for a Global Namespace](/tctl-v1/namespace#update)\n\nThe Global Namespace feature enables Workflow Executions to progress through another Cluster in the event of a failover.\n\nA Global Namespace may be replicated to any number of Clusters, but is active in only one Cluster at any given time.\n\nFor a failover to be successful, Worker Processes must be polling for Tasks for the Global Namespace on all Clusters.\n\nA Global Namespace has a failover version.\nBecause a failover can be triggered from any Cluster, the failover version prevents certain conflicts from occurring if a failover is mistakenly triggered simultaneously on two Clusters.\n\nOnly the active Cluster dispatches [Tasks](/concepts/what-is-a-task);

an Activity is designed to handle such issues.\n\n- **Activity Execution**: When an Activity Execution is spawned, it is associated with a default Retry Policy, and thus Activity Task Executions are retried by default.\n  When an Activity Task Execution is retried, the Cluster places a new [Activity Task](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task) into its respective [Activity Task Queue](/concepts/what-is-a-task-queue), which results in a new Activity Task Execution.\n\n## Custom Retry Policy\n\nTo use a custom Retry Policy, provide it as an options parameter when starting a Workflow Execution or Activity Execution.\nOnly certain scenarios merit starting a Workflow Execution with a custom Retry Policy, such as the following:\n\n- A [Temporal Cron Job](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job) or some other stateless, always-running Workflow Execution that can benefit from retries.\n- A file-processing or media-encoding Workflow Execution that downloads files to a host.\n\n## Properties\n\n### Default values for Retry Policy\n\n```\nInitial Interval     = 1 second\nBackoff Coefficient  = 2.0\nMaximum Interval     = 100 × Initial Interval\nMaximum Attempts     = ∞\nNon-Retryable Errors = []\n```\n\n### Initial Interval\n\n- **Description**: Amount of time that must elapse before the first retry occurs.\n  - **The default value is 1 second.**\n- **Use case**: This is used as the base interval time for the [Backoff Coefficient](#backoff-coefficient) to multiply against.\n\n### Backoff Coefficient\n\n- **Description**: The value dictates how much the _retry interval_ increases.\n  - **The default value is 2.0.**\n  - A backoff coefficient of 1.0 means that the retry interval always equals the [Initial Interval](#initial-interval).\n- **Use case**: Use this attribute to increase the interval between retries.\n  By having a backoff coefficient greater than 1.0, the first few retries happen relatively quickly to overcome intermittent failures, but subsequent retries happen farther and farther apart to account for longer outages.\n  Use the [Maximum Interval](#maximum-interval) attribute to prevent the coefficient from increasing the retry interval too much.\n\n### Maximum Interval\n\n- **Description**: Specifies the maximum interval between retries.\n  - **The default value is 100 times the [Initial Interval](#initial-interval).**\n- **Use case**: This attribute is useful for [Backoff Coefficients](#backoff-coefficient) that are greater than 1.0 because it prevents the retry interval from growing infinitely.\n\n### Maximum Attempts\n\n- **Description**: Specifies the maximum number of execution attempts that can be made in the presence of failures.\n  - **The default is unlimited.**\n  - If this limit is exceeded, the execution fails without retrying again. When this happens an error is returned.\n  - Setting the value to 0 also means unlimited.\n  - Setting the value to 1 means a single execution attempt and no retries.\n  - Setting the value to a negative integer results in an error when the execution is invoked.\n- **Use case**: Use this attribute to ensure that retries do not continue indefinitely.\n  However, in the majority of cases, we recommend relying on the Workflow Execution Timeout, in the case of [Workflows](#workflow), or Schedule-To-Close Timeout, in the case of [Activities](#activity), to limit the total duration of retries instead of using this attribute.\n\n### Non-Retryable Errors\n\n- **Description**: Specifies errors that shouldn't be retried.\n  - **Default is none.**\n  - If one of those errors occurs, the [Activity Task Execution](#activity-task-execution) or [Workflow Execution](#workflow-execution) is not retried.\n  - The errors are matched against the `type` field of the [ApplicationFailure](/kb/failures#application-failure).\n- **Use case**: There may be errors that you know of that should not trigger a retry.\n  In this case, you can specify them such that, if they occur, the given execution is not retried.\n\n## Retry interval\n\nThe wait time before a retry is the _retry interval_. A retry interval is the smaller of two values:\n\n- The [Initial Interval](#initial-interval) multiplied by the [Backoff Coefficient](#backoff-coefficient) raised to the power of the number of retries.\n- The [Maximum Interval](#maximum-interval).\n\n## Event History\n\nThere are some subtle nuances to how Events are recorded to an Event History when a Retry Policy comes into play.\n\n- For an Activity Execution, the [ActivityTaskStarted](/concepts/what-is-an-event#activitytaskstarted) Event will not show up in the Workflow Execution Event History until the Activity Execution has completed or failed (having exhausted all retries).\n  This is to avoid filling the Event History with noise.\n  Use the Describe API to get a pending Activity Execution's attempt count.\n\n- For a Workflow Execution with a Retry Policy, if the Workflow Execution fails, the Workflow Execution will [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new) and the associated Event is written to the Event History.\n  The [WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew](/concepts/what-is-an-event#workflowexecutioncontinuedasnew) Event will have an \"initiator\" field that will specify the Retry Policy as the value and the new Run Id for the next retry attempt.\n  The new Workflow Execution is created immediately.\n  But the first Workflow Task won't be scheduled until the backoff duration is exhausted.\n  That duration is recorded as the `firstWorkflowTaskBackoff` field of the new run's `WorkflowExecutionStartedEventAttributes` event.\n","is_empty":false}}]},{"file_name":"tasks.md","id":"tasks","file_dir":"/","title":"Tasks","sidebar_label":"Tasks","description":"Temporal Task Queues and Worker Processes are tightly coupled

that wasn't drained for that time.\n\nThere are two types of Task Queues, Activity Task Queues and Workflow Task Queues.\n\n![Task Queue component](/diagrams/task-queue.svg)\n\nTask Queues are very lightweight components.\nTask Queues do not require explicit registration but instead are created on demand when a Workflow Execution or Activity spawns or when a Worker Process subscribes to it.\nWhen a Task Queue is created, both a Workflow Task Queue and an Activity Task Queue are created under the same name.\nThere is no limit to the number of Task Queues a Temporal Application can use or a Temporal Cluster can maintain.\n\nWorkers poll for Tasks in Task Queues via synchronous RPC.\nThis implementation offers several benefits:\n\n- A Worker Process polls for a message only when it has spare capacity, avoiding overloading itself.\n- In effect, Task Queues enable load balancing across many Worker Processes.\n- Task Queues enable what we call [Task Routing](/concepts/what-is-task-routing), which is the routing of specific Tasks to specific Worker Processes or even a specific process.\n- Task Queues support server-side throttling, which enables you to limit the Task dispatching rate to the pool of Worker Processes while still supporting Task dispatching at higher rates when spikes happen.\n- When all Worker Processes are down, messages simply persist in a Task Queue, waiting for the Worker Processes to recover.\n- Worker Processes do not need to advertise themselves through DNS or any other network discovery mechanism.\n- Worker Processes do not need to have any open ports, which is more secure.\n\nAll Workers listening to a given Task Queue must have identical registrations of Activities and/or Workflows.\nThe one exception is during a Server upgrade, where it is okay to have registration temporarily misaligned while the binary rolls out.\n\n#### Where to set Task Queues\n\nThere are four places where the name of the Task Queue can be set by the developer.\n\n1. A Task Queue must be set when spawning a Workflow Execution:\n\n- [How to start a Workflow Execution using an SDK](/application-development/foundations#set-task-queue)\n- [How to start a Workflow Execution using tctl](/tctl-v1/workflow#start)\n\n2.

Routing","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTask Routing is simply when a Task Queue is paired with one or more Workers, primarily for Activity Task Executions.\n\nThis could also mean employing multiple Task Queues, each one paired with a Worker Process.\n\nTask Routing has many applicable use cases.\n\n### Flow control\n\nA Worker that consumes from a Task Queue asks for an Activity Task only when it has available capacity, so it is never overloaded by request spikes.\nIf Activity Tasks get created faster than Workers can process them, they are backlogged in the Task Queue.\n\n### Throttling\n\nThe rate at which each Activity Worker polls for and processes Activity Tasks is configurable per Worker.\nWorkers do not exceed this rate even if it has spare capacity.\nThere is also support for global Task Queue rate limiting.\nThis limit works across all Workers for the given Task Queue.\nIt is frequently used to limit load on a downstream service that an Activity calls into.\n\n### Specific environments\n\nIn some cases, you might need to execute Activities in a dedicated environment.\nTo send Activity Tasks to this environment, use a dedicated Task Queue.\n\n#### Route Activity Tasks to a specific host\n\nIn some use cases, such as file processing or machine learning model training, an Activity Task must be routed to a specific Worker Process or Worker Entity.\n\nFor example, suppose that you have a Workflow with the following three separate Activities:\n\n- Download a file.\n- Process the file in some way.\n- Upload a file to another location.\n\nThe first Activity, to download the file, could occur on any Worker on any host.\nHowever, the second and third Activities must be executed by a Worker on the same host where the first Activity downloaded the file.\n\nIn a real-life scenario, you might have many Worker Processes scaled over many hosts.\nYou would need to develop your Temporal Application to route Tasks to specific Worker Processes when needed.\n\nCode samples:\n\n- [Go file processing example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/master/fileprocessing)\n- [Java file processing example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/fileprocessing)\n- [PHP file processing example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/tree/master/app/src/FileProcessing)\n\n#### Sessions\n\nSome SDKs provide a Session API that provides a straightforward way to ensure that Activity Tasks are executed with the same Worker without requiring you to manually specify Task Queue names.\nIt also includes features like **concurrent session limitations** and **worker failure detection**.\n\n- [How to create Worker Sessions in Go](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/go/how-to-create-a-worker-session-in-go)\n\n#### Route Activity Tasks to a specific process\n\nSome Activities load large datasets and cache them in the process.\nThe Activities that rely on those datasets should be routed to the same process.\n\nIn this case, a unique Task Queue would exist for each Worker Process involved.\n\n#### Workers with different capabilities\n\nSome Workers might exist on GPU boxes versus non-GPU boxes.\nIn this case, each type of box would have its own Task Queue and a Workflow can pick one to send Activity Tasks.\n\n### Multiple priorities\n\nIf your use case involves more than one priority, you can create one Task Queue per priority, with a Worker pool per priority.\n\n### Versioning\n\nTask Routing is the simplest way to version your code.\n\nIf you have a new backward-incompatible Activity Definition, start by using a different Task Queue.\n","is_empty":false}}]},{"file_name":"temporal.md","id":"temporal","file_dir":"/","title":"Temporal","sidebar_label":"Temporal","description":"The Temporal Platform

Workflows run in a sandbox environment.\nIf a Workflow Execution performs a non-deterministic event, an exception is thrown, which results in failing the Workflow Task.\nThe Workflow will not progress

Each word in a **Text** is considered a searchable keyword.\n  For a UUID, that can be problematic because Elasticsearch indexes each portion of the UUID separately.\n  To have the whole string considered as a searchable keyword, use the **Keyword** type.\n  For example, if the key `ProductId` has the value of `2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`:\n  - As a **Keyword** it would be matched only by `ProductId = \"2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`.\n  - As a **Text** it would be matched by `ProductId = 2dd8`, which could cause unwanted matches.\n- The **Text** type cannot be used in the \"Order By\" clause.\n\n- [How to view Search Attributes using tctl](/tctl-v1/cluster#get-search-attributes)\n\n#### Search Attributes as Workflow Execution metadata\n\nTo actually have results from the use of a [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter), Search Attributes must be added to a Workflow Execution as metadata.\nHow to do this entirely depends on the method by which you spawn the Workflow Execution:\n\n- [How to set Search Attributes as Workflow Execution metadata](/app-dev-context/set-custom-search-attributes)\n","is_empty":false}}]},{"file_name":"workers.md","id":"workers","file_dir":"/","title":"Workers","sidebar_label":"Workers","description":"This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Temporal Workers.","use_description":true,"toc_max_heading_level":4,"add_tabs_support":true,"sections":[{"type":"p","id":"concepts/what-is-a-worker","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-worker.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-worker.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-worker","title":"What is a Worker?","description":"In day-to-day conversations, the term Worker is used to denote both a Worker Program and a Worker Process.

The Cluster is solely responsible for orchestrating state transitions and providing Tasks to the next available Worker Entity.\n\nWhile data transferred in Event Histories is [secured by mTLS](/security/#encryption-of-network-traffic), by default, it is still readable at rest in the Temporal Cluster.\n\nTo solve this, Temporal SDKs offer a [Data Converter API](/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter) that you can use to customize the serialization of data going out of and coming back in to a Worker Entity, with the net effect of guaranteeing that the Temporal Cluster cannot read sensitive business data.\n\nIn many of our tutorials, we show you how to run both a Temporal Cluster and one Worker on the same machine for local development.\nHowever, a production-grade Temporal Application typically has a _fleet_ of Worker Processes, all running on hosts external to the Temporal Cluster.\nA Temporal Application can have as many Worker Processes as needed.\n\nA Worker Process can be both a Workflow Worker Process and an Activity Worker Process.\nMany SDKs support the ability to have multiple Worker Entities in a single Worker Process.\n(Worker entity creation and management differ between SDKs.)\nA single Worker Entity can listen to only a single Task Queue.\nBut if a Worker Process has multiple Worker Entities, the Worker Process could be listening to multiple Task Queues.\n\n![Entity relationship diagram (meta model) of Worker Processes, Task Queues, and Tasks](/diagrams/worker-and-server-entity-relationship.svg)\n\nWorker Processes executing Activity Tasks must have access to any resources needed to execute the actions that are defined in Activity Definitions, such as the following:\n\n- Network access for external API calls.\n- Credentials for infrastructure provisioning.\n- Specialized GPUs for machine learning utilities.\n\nThe Temporal Cluster itself has [internal workers](https://temporal.io/blog/workflow-engine-principles/#system-workflows-1910) for system Workflow Executions.\nHowever, these internal workers are not visible to the

Definition","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.\n\n- [How to develop a Workflow Definition](/app-dev-context/developing-workflows)\n\nA Workflow Definition is often also referred to as a Workflow Function.\nIn Temporal's documentation, a Workflow Definition refers to the source for the instance of a Workflow Execution, while a Workflow Function refers to the source for the instance of a Workflow Function Execution.\n\nA Workflow Execution effectively executes once to completion, while a Workflow Function Execution occurs many times during the life of a Workflow Execution.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you write a Workflow Definition in a language that has a corresponding Temporal SDK.\n\n### Deterministic constraints\n\nA critical aspect of developing Workflow Definitions is ensuring they exhibit certain deterministic traits – that is, making sure that the same Commands are emitted in the same sequence, whenever a corresponding Workflow Function Execution (instance of the Function Definition) is re-executed.\n\nThe execution semantics of a Workflow Execution include the re-execution of a Workflow Function, which is called a [Replay](#replays).\nThe use of Workflow APIs in the function is what generates [Commands](/concepts/what-is-a-command).\nCommands tell the Cluster which Events to create and add to the Workflow Execution's Event History.\nWhen a Workflow Function executes, the Commands that are emitted are compared with the existing Event History.\nIf a corresponding Event already exists within the Event History that maps to the generation of that Command in the same sequence, and some specific metadata of that Command matches with some specific metadata of the Event, then the Function Execution progresses.\n\nFor example, using an SDK's \"Execute Activity\" API generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands/#scheduleactivitytask) Command.\nWhen this API is called upon re-execution, that Command is compared with the Event that is in the same location within the sequence.\nThe Event in the sequence must be an [ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events/#activitytaskscheduled) Event, where the Activity name is the same as what is in the Command.\n\nIf a generated Command doesn't match what it needs to in the existing Event History, then the Workflow Execution returns a _non-deterministic_ error.\n\nThe following are the two reasons why a Command might be generated out of sequence or the wrong Command might be generated altogether:\n\n1. Code changes are made to a Workflow Definition that is in use by a running Workflow Execution.\n2. There is intrinsic non-deterministic logic (such as inline random branching).\n\n### Code changes can cause non-deterministic behavior\n\nThe Workflow Definition can change in very limited ways once there is a Workflow Execution depending on it.\nTo alleviate non-deterministic issues that arise from code changes, we recommend using [Workflow Versioning](#workflow-versioning).\n\nFor example, let's say we have a Workflow Definition that defines the following sequence:\n\n1. Start and wait on a Timer/sleep.\n2. Spawn and wait on an Activity Execution.\n3. Complete.\n\nWe start a Worker and spawn a Workflow Execution that uses that Workflow Definition.\nThe Worker would emit the [StartTimer](/references/commands/#starttimer) Command and the Workflow Execution would become suspended.\n\nBefore the Timer is up, we change the Workflow Definition to the following sequence:\n\n1. Spawn and wait on an Activity Execution.\n2. Start and wait on a Timer/sleep.\n3. Complete.\n\nWhen the Timer fires, the next Workflow Task will cause the Workflow Function to re-execute.\nThe first Command the Worker sees would be ScheduleActivityTask Command, which wouldn't match up to the expected [TimerStarted](/references/events/#timerstarted) Event.\n\nThe Workflow Execution would fail and return a non-deterministic error.\n\nThe following are examples of minor changes that would not result in non-determinism errors when re-executing a History which already contain the Events:\n\n- Changing the duration of a Timer (unless changing from a duration of 0).\n- Changing the arguments to:\n  - The Activity Options in a call to spawn an Activity Execution (local or nonlocal).\n  - The Child Workflow Options in a call to spawn a Child Workflow Execution.\n  - Call to Signal an External Workflow Execution.\n- Adding a Signal Handler for a Signal Type that has not been sent to this Workflow Execution.\n\n### Intrinsic non-deterministic logic\n\nIntrinsic non-determinism is when a Workflow Function Execution might emit a different sequence of Commands on re-execution, regardless of whether all the input parameters are the same.\n\nFor example, a Workflow Definition can not have inline logic that branches (emits a different Command sequence) based off a local time setting or a random number.\nIn the representative pseudocode below, the `local_clock()` function returns the local time, rather than Temporal-defined time:\n\n```text\nfn your_workflow() {\n  if local_clock().is_before(\"12pm\") {\n    await workflow.sleep(duration_until(\"12pm\"))\n  } else {\n    await your_afternoon_activity()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEach Temporal SDK offers APIs that enable Workflow Definitions to have logic that gets and uses time, random numbers, and data from unreliable resources.\nWhen those APIs are used, the results are stored as part of the Event History, which means that a re-executed Workflow Function will issue the same sequence of Commands, even if there is branching involved.\n\nIn other words, all operations that do not purely mutate the Workflow Execution's state should occur through a Temporal SDK API.\n\n### Workflow Versioning\n\nThe Workflow Versioning feature enables the creation of logical branching inside a Workflow Definition based on a developer specified version identifier.\nThis feature is useful for Workflow Definition logic needs to be updated, but there are running Workflow Executions that currently depends on it.\nIt is important to note that a practical way to handle different versions of Workflow Definitions, without using the versioning API, is to run the different versions on separate Task Queues.\n\n- [How to version Workflow Definitions in Go](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/go/versioning)\n- [How to version Workflow Definitions in Java](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/java/versioning)\n- [How to version Workflow Definitions in TypeScript](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/patching)\n\n### Handling unreliable Worker Processes\n\nYou do not handle Worker Process failure or restarts in a Workflow Definition.\n\nWorkflow Function Executions are completely oblivious to the Worker Process in terms of failures or downtime.\nThe Temporal Platform ensures that the state of a Workflow Execution is recovered and progress resumes if there is an outage of either Worker Processes or the Temporal Cluster itself.\nThe only reason a Workflow Execution might fail is due to the code throwing an error or exception, not because of underlying infrastructure outages.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-workflow-type.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type","title":"What is a Workflow Type?","description":"A Workflow Type is a name that maps to a Workflow Definition.","label":"Workflow Type","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Workflow Type is a name that maps to a Workflow Definition.\n\n- A single Workflow Type can be instantiated as multiple Workflow Executions.\n- A Workflow Type is scoped by a Task Queue.\n  It is acceptable to have the same Workflow Type name map to different Workflow Definitions if they are using completely different Workers.\n\n![Workflow Type cardinality with Workflow Definitions and Workflow Executions](/diagrams/workflow-type-cardinality.svg)\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-workflow-execution.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution","title":"What is a Workflow Execution?","description":"A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution.

During a Replay the Commands that are generated are checked against an existing Event History. Replays are necessary and often happen to give the effect that Workflow Executions are resumable, reliable, and durable.\n\nFor more information, see [Deterministic constraints](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints).\n\nIf a failure occurs, the Workflow Execution picks up where the last recorded event occurred in the Event History.\n\n- [How to use Replay APIs to test Workflow Definitions](/app-dev-context/replays)\n\n### Commands and awaitables\n\nA Workflow Execution does two things:\n\n1. Issue [Commands](/concepts/what-is-a-command).\n2. Wait on an Awaitables (often called Futures).\n\n![Command generation and waiting](/diagrams/workflow-execution-progession-simple.svg)\n\nCommands are issued and Awaitables are provided by the use of Workflow APIs in the [Workflow Definition](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition).\n\nCommands are generated whenever the Workflow Function is executed.\nThe Worker Process supervises the Command generation and makes sure that it maps to the current Event History.\n(For more information, see [Deterministic constraints](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints).)\nThe Worker Process batches the Commands and then suspends progress to send the Commands to the Cluster whenever the Workflow Function reaches a place where it can no longer progress without a result from an Awaitable.\n\nA Workflow Execution may only ever block progress on an Awaitable that is provided through a Temporal SDK API.\nAwaitables are provided when using APIs for the following:\n\n- Awaiting: Progress can block using explicit \"Await\" APIs.\n- Requesting cancellation of another Workflow Execution: Progress can block on confirmation that the other Workflow Execution is cancelled.\n- Sending a [Signal](/concepts/what-is-a-signal): Progress can block on confirmation that the Signal sent.\n- Spawning a [Child Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-child-workflow-execution): Progress can block on confirmation that the Child Workflow Execution started, and on the result of the Child Workflow Execution.\n- Spawning an [Activity Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution): Progress can block on the result of the Activity Execution.\n- Starting a Timer: Progress can block until the Timer fires.\n\n### Status\n\nA Workflow Execution can be either Open or Closed.\n\n![Workflow Execution statuses](/diagrams/workflow-execution-statuses.svg)\n\n**Open**\n\n- Running: The only Open status for a Workflow Execution.\n  When the Workflow Execution is Running, it is either actively progressing or is waiting on something.\n\n**Closed**\n\nA Closed status means that the Workflow Execution cannot make further progress because of one of the following reasons:\n\n- Cancelled: The Workflow Execution successfully handled a cancellation request.\n- Completed: The Workflow Execution has completed successfully.\n- Continued-As-New: The Workflow Execution [Continued-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new).\n- Failed: The Workflow Execution returned an error and failed.\n- Terminated: The Workflow Execution was terminated.\n- Timed Out: The Workflow Execution reached a timeout limit.\n\n### Workflow Execution Chain\n\nA Workflow Execution Chain is a sequence of Workflow Executions that share the same Workflow Id.\nEach link in the Chain is often called a Workflow Run.\nEach Workflow Run in the sequence is connected by one of the following:\n\n- [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new)\n- [Retries](/concepts/what-is-a-retry-policy)\n- [Temporal Cron Job](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job)\n\nA Workflow Execution is uniquely identified by its [Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace), [Workflow Id](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id), and [Run Id](/concepts/what-is-a-run-id).\n\nThe [Workflow Execution Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout) applies to a Workflow Execution Chain.\nThe [Workflow Run Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-run-timeout) applies to a single Workflow Execution (Workflow Run).\n\n### Event loop\n\nA Workflow Execution is made up of a sequence of [Events](/concepts/what-is-an-event) called an [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history).\nEvents are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to either Commands or actions requested by a Temporal Client (such as a request to spawn a Workflow Execution).\n\n![Workflow Execution](/diagrams/workflow-execution-swim-lane-01.svg)\n\n### Time constraints\n\n**Is there a limit to how long Workflows can run?**\n\nNo, there is no time constraint on how long a Workflow Execution can be Running.\n\nHowever, Workflow Executions intended to run indefinitely should be written with some care.\nThe Temporal Cluster stores the complete Event History for the entire lifecycle of a Workflow Execution.\nThere is a hard limit of 50,000 Events in a Workflow Execution Event History, as well as a hard limit of 50 MB in terms of size.\nThe Temporal Cluster logs a warning at every 10,000 Events.\nWhen the Event History reaches 50,000 Events or the size limit of 50 MB, the Workflow Execution is forcefully terminated.\n\nTo prevent _runaway_ Workflow Executions, you can use the Workflow Execution Timeout, the Workflow Run Timeout, or both.\nA Workflow Execution Timeout can be used to limit the duration of Workflow Execution Chain, and a Workflow Run Timeout can be used to limit the duration an individual Workflow Execution (Run).\n\nYou can use the [Continue-As-New](/concepts/what-is-continue-as-new) feature to close the current Workflow Execution and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation.\nThe Workflow Execution spawned from Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.\nFor example, it may be reasonable to use Continue-As-New once per day for a long-running Workflow Execution that is generating a large Event History.\n\n### Limits\n\nEach pending Activity generates a metadata entry in the Workflow's mutable state.\nToo many entries create a large mutable state, which causes unstable persistence.\n\nTo protect the system, Temporal enforces a maximum of 50,000 pending Activities, Child Workflows, external Workflows, and Signals.\nThese limits are set with the following [dynamic configuration keys](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/service/history/configs/config.go):\n\n- `NumPendingChildExecutionsLimit`\n- `NumPendingActivitiesLimit`\n- `NumPendingSignals`\n- `NumPendingCancelRequestsLimit`\n\nBy default, Temporal fails Workflow Task Executions that would cause the Workflow to surpass 50,000 pending Activities, Child Workflows, external Workflows, or Signals.\nSimilar constraints are enforced for `SignalExternalWorkflowExecution`, `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution`, and `StartChildWorkflowExecution` Commands.\n\n:::note\n\nCloud users are limited to 2,000 each of pending Activities, Child Workflows, external Workflows, and Signals.\n\n:::\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-a-command","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-command.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-command.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-command","title":"What

As New](/diagrams/parent-child-workflow-execution-with-continue-as-new.svg)\n\n### When to use Child Workflows\n\n**Consider Workflow Execution Event History size limits.**\n\nAn individual Workflow Execution has an [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history) size limit, which imposes a couple of considerations for using Child Workflows.\n\nOn one hand, because Child Workflow Executions have their own Event Histories, they are often used to partition large workloads into smaller chunks.\nFor example, a single Workflow Execution does not have enough space in its Event History to spawn 100,000 [Activity Executions](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution).\nBut a Parent Workflow Execution can spawn 1,000 Child Workflow Executions that each spawn 1,000 Activity Executions to achieve a total of 1,000,000 Activity Executions.\n\nHowever, because a Parent Workflow Execution Event History contains [Events](/concepts/what-is-an-event) that correspond to the status of the Child Workflow Execution, a single Parent should not spawn more than 1,000 Child Workflow Executions.\n\nIn general, however, Child Workflow Executions result in more overall Events recorded in Event Histories than Activities.\nBecause each entry in an Event History is a _cost_ in terms of compute resources, this could become a factor in very large workloads.\nTherefore, we recommend starting with a single Workflow implementation that uses Activities until there is a clear need for Child Workflows.\n\n**Consider each Child Workflow Execution as a separate service.**\n\nBecause a Child Workflow Execution can be processed by a completely separate set of [Workers](/concepts/what-is-a-worker) than the Parent Workflow Execution, it can act as an entirely separate service.\nHowever, this also means that a Parent Workflow Execution and a Child Workflow Execution do not share any local state.\nAs all Workflow Executions, they can communicate only via asynchronous [Signals](/concepts/what-is-a-signal).\n\n**Consider that a single Child Workflow Execution can represent a single resource.**\n\nAs all Workflow Executions, a Child Workflow Execution can create a one to one mapping with a resource.\nFor example, a Workflow that manages host upgrades could spawn a Child Workflow Execution per host.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h3","id":"concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-parent-close-policy.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy","title":"What

Execution.","label":"Temporal Cron Job","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nA Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.\n\n- [How to set a Cron Schedule](/application-development/features#temporal-cron-jobs)\n\n![Temporal Cron Job timeline](/diagrams/temporal-cron-job.svg)\n\nA Temporal Cron Job is similar to a classic unix cron job.\nJust as a unix cron job accepts a command and a schedule on which to execute that command, a Cron Schedule can be provided with the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.\nIf a Cron Schedule is provided, the Temporal Server will spawn an execution for the associated Workflow Type per the schedule.\n\nEach Workflow Execution within the series is considered a Run.\n\n- Each Run receives the same input parameters as the initial Run.\n- Each Run inherits the same Workflow Options as the initial Run.\n\nThe Temporal Server spawns the first Workflow Execution in the chain of Runs immediately.\nHowever, it calculates and applies a backoff (`firstWorkflowTaskBackoff`) so that the first Workflow Task of the Workflow Execution does not get placed into a Task Queue until the scheduled time.\nAfter each Run Completes, Fails, or reaches the [Workflow Run Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-run-timeout), the same thing happens: the next run will be created immediately with a new `firstWorkflowTaskBackoff` that is calculated based on the current Server time and the defined Cron Schedule.\n\nThe Temporal Server spawns the next Run only after the current Run has Completed, Failed, or has reached the Workflow Run Timeout.\nThis means that, if a Retry Policy has also been provided, and a Run Fails or reaches the Workflow Run Timeout, the Run will first be retried per the Retry Policy until the Run Completes or the Retry Policy has been exhausted.\nIf the next Run, per the Cron Schedule, is due to spawn while the current Run is still Open (including retries), the Server automatically starts the new Run after the current Run completes successfully.\nThe start time for this new Run and the Cron definitions are used to calculate the `firstWorkflowTaskBackoff` that is applied to the new Run.\n\nA [Workflow Execution Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout) is used to limit how long a Workflow can be executing (have an Open status), including retries and any usage of Continue As New.\nThe Cron Schedule runs until the Workflow Execution Timeout is reached or you terminate the Workflow.\n\n![Temporal Cron Job Run Failure with a Retry Policy](/diagrams/temporal-cron-job-failure-with-retry.svg)\n\n### Cron Schedules\n\nCron Schedules are interpreted in UTC time by default.\n\nThe Cron Schedule is provided as a string and must follow one of two specifications:\n\n**Classic specification**\n\nThis is what the \"classic\" specification looks like:\n\n```\n┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)\n│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)\n│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)\n│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)\n│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)\n│ │ │ │ │\n│ │ │ │ │\n* * * * *\n```\n\nFor example, `15 8 * * *` causes a Workflow Execution to spawn daily at 8:15 AM UTC.\nUse the [crontab guru site](https://crontab.guru/) to test your cron expressions.\n\n### `robfig` predefined schedules and intervals\n\nYou can also pass any of the [predefined schedules](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3#hdr-Predefined_schedules) or [intervals](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3#hdr-Intervals) described in the [`robfig/cron` documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3).\n\n```\n| Schedules              | Description                                | Equivalent To |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |\n| @yearly (or @annually) | Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st        | 0 0 1 1 *     |\n| @monthly               | Run once a month, midnight, first of month | 0 0 1 * *     |\n| @weekly                | Run once a week, midnight between Sat/Sun  | 0 0 * * 0     |\n| @daily (or @midnight)  | Run once a day, midnight                   | 0 0 * * *     |\n| @hourly                | Run once an hour, beginning of hour        | 0 * * * *     |\n```\n\nFor example, \"@weekly\" causes a Workflow Execution to spawn once a week at midnight between Saturday and Sunday.\n\nIntervals just take a string that can be accepted by [time.ParseDuration](http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).\n\n```\n@every <duration>\n```\n\n### Time zones\n\n_This feature only applies in Temporal 1.15 and up_\n\nYou can change the time zone that a Cron Schedule is interpreted in by prefixing the specification with `CRON_TZ=America/New_York` (or your [desired time zone from tz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)). `CRON_TZ=America/New_York 15 8 * * *` therefore spawns a Workflow Execution every day at 8:15 AM New York time, subject to caveats listed below.\n\nConsider that using time zones in production introduces a surprising amount of complexity and failure modes!\n**If at all possible, we recommend specifying Cron Schedules in UTC (the default)**.\n\nIf you need to use time zones, here are a few edge cases to keep in mind:\n\n- **Beware Daylight Saving Time**: If a Temporal Cron Job is scheduled around the time when daylight saving time (DST) begins or ends (for example, `30 2 * * *`), **it might run zero, one, or two times in a day**! The Cron library that we use does not do any special handling of DST transitions. Avoid schedules that include times that fall within DST transition periods.\n  - For example, in the US, DST begins at 2 AM. When you \"fall back,\" the clock goes `1:59 … 1:00 … 1:01 … 1:59 … 2:00 … 2:01 AM` and any Cron jobs that fall in that 1 AM hour are fired again. The inverse happens when clocks \"spring forward\" for DST, and Cron jobs that fall in the 2 AM hour are skipped.\n  - In other time zones like Chile and Iran, DST \"spring forward\" is at midnight. 11:59 PM is followed by 1 AM, which means `00:00:00` never happens.\n- **Self Hosting note**: If you manage your own Temporal Cluster, you are responsible for ensuring that it has access to current `tzdata` files. The official Docker images are built with [tzdata](https://docs.w3cub.com/go/time/tzdata/index) installed (provided by Alpine Linux), but ultimately you should be aware of how tzdata is deployed and updated in your infrastructure.\n- **Updating Temporal**: If you use the official Docker images, note that an upgrade of the Temporal Cluster may include an update to the tzdata files, which may change the meaning of your Cron Schedule. You should be aware of upcoming changes to the definitions of the time zones you use, particularly around daylight saving time start/end dates.\n- **Absolute Time Fixed at Start**: The absolute start time of the next Run is computed and stored in the database when the previous Run completes, and is not recomputed. This means that if you have a Cron Schedule that runs very infrequently, and the definition of the time zone changes between one Run and the next, the Run might happen at the wrong time. For example, `CRON_TZ=America/Los_Angeles 0 12 11 11 *` means \"noon in Los Angeles on November 11\" (normally not in DST). If at some point the government makes any changes (for example, move the end of DST one week later, or stay on permanent DST year-round), the meaning of that specification changes. In that first year, the Run happens at the wrong time, because it was computed using the older definition.\n\n### How to stop a Temporal Cron Job\n\nA Temporal Cron Job does not stop spawning Runs until it has been Terminated or until the [Workflow Execution Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout) is reached.\n\nA Cancellation Request affects only the current Run.\n\nUse the Workflow Id in any requests to Cancel or Terminate.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"concepts/what-is-a-schedule","node":{"file_name":"what-is-a-schedule.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-a-schedule.md","id":"concepts/what-is-a-schedule","title":"What is a Schedule","description":"A Schedule enables the scheduling of Workflow Executions.","label":"Schedule","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":["Introduced in Temporal Server version 1.17.0","Available in tctl v1.17 and Temporal CLI","Available in Temporal Cloud via tctl and CLI"],"markdown_content":"\nA Schedule contains instructions for starting a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) at specific times.\nSchedules provide a more flexible and user-friendly approach than [Temporal Cron Jobs](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job).\n\n- [How to enable Schedules](#limitations)\n- [How to operate Schedules using tctl](/tctl-v1/schedule#)\n\nA Schedule has an identity and is independent of a Workflow Execution.\nThis differs from a Temporal Cron Job, which relies on a cron schedule as a property of the Workflow Execution.\n\n### Action\n\nThe Action of a Schedule is where the Workflow Execution properties are established, such as Workflow Type, Task Queue, parameters, and timeouts.\n\nWorkflow Executions started by a Schedule have the following additional properties:\n\n- The Action's timestamp is appended to the Workflow Id.\n- The `TemporalScheduledStartTime` [Search Attribute](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute) is added to the Workflow Execution.\n  The value is the Action's timestamp.\n- The `TemporalScheduledById` Search Attribute is added to the Workflow Execution.\n  The value is the Schedule Id.\n\n### Spec\n\nThe Schedule Spec describes when the Action is taken.\nThere are two kinds of Schedule Spec:\n\n- A simple interval, like \"every 30 minutes\" (aligned to start at the Unix epoch, and optionally including a phase offset).\n- A calendar-based expression, similar to the \"cron expressions\" supported by lots of software, including the older Temporal Cron feature.\n\nThese two kinds have multiple representations, depending on the interface or SDK you're using, but they all support the same features.\n\nIn tctl, for example, an interval is specified as a string like `45m` to mean every 45 minutes, or `6h/5h` to mean every 6 hours but at the start of the fifth hour within each period.\n\nIn tctl, a calendar expression can be specified as either a traditional cron string with five (or six or seven) positional fields, or as JSON with named fields:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"year\": \"2022\",\n  \"month\": \"Jan,Apr,Jul,Oct\",\n  \"dayOfMonth\": \"1,15\",\n  \"hour\": \"11-14\"\n}\n```\n\nThe following calendar JSON fields are available:\n\n- `year`\n- `month`\n- `dayOfMonth`\n- `dayOfWeek`\n- `hour`\n- `minute`\n- `second`\n- `comment`\n\nEach field can contain a comma-separated list of ranges (or the `*` wildcard), and each range can include a slash followed by a skip value.\nThe `hour`, `minute`, and `second` fields default to `0` while the others default to `*`, so you can describe many useful specs with only a few fields.\n\nFor `month`, names of months may be used instead of integers (case-insensitive, abbreviations permitted).\nFor `dayOfWeek`, day-of-week names may be used.\n\nThe `comment` field is optional and can be used to include a free-form description of the intent of the calendar spec, useful for complicated specs.\n\nNo matter which form you supply, calendar and interval specs are converted to canonical representations.\nWhat you see when you \"describe\" or \"list\" a Schedule might not look exactly like what you entered, but it has the same meaning.\n\nOther Spec features:\n\n**Multiple intervals/calendar expressions:** A Spec can have combinations of multiple intervals and/or calendar expressions to define a specific Schedule.\n\n**Time bounds:** Provide an absolute start or end time (or both) with a Spec to ensure that no actions are taken before the start time or after the end time.\n\n**Exclusions:** A Spec can contain exclusions in the form of zero or more calendar expressions.\nThis can be used to express scheduling like \"each Monday at noon except for holidays.\nYou'll have to provide your own set of exclusions and include it in each schedule; there are no pre-defined sets.\n(This feature isn't currently exposed in tctl or the Temporal Web UI.)\n\n**Jitter:** If given, a random offset between zero and the maximum jitter is added to each Action time (but bounded by the time until the next scheduled Action).\n\n**Time zones:** By default, calendar-based expressions are interpreted in UTC.\nTemporal recommends using UTC to avoid various surprising properties of time zones.\nIf you don't want to use UTC, you can provide the name of a time zone.\nThe time zone definition is loaded on the Temporal Server Worker Service from either disk or the fallback embedded in the binary.\n\nFor more operational control, embed the contents of the time zone database file in the Schedule Spec itself.\n(Note: this isn't currently exposed in tctl or the web UI.)\n\n### Pause\n\nA Schedule can be Paused.\nWhen a Schedule is Paused, the Spec has no effect.\nHowever, you can still force manual actions by using the [tctl schedule trigger](/tctl-v1/schedule#trigger) command.\n\nTo assist communication among developers and operators, a “notes” field can be updated on pause or resume to store an explanation for the current state.\n\n### Backfill\n\nA Schedule can be Backfilled.\nWhen a Schedule is Backfilled, all the Actions that would have been taken over a specified time period are taken now (in parallel if the `AllowAll` [Overlap Policy](#overlap-policy) is used; sequentially if `BufferAll` is used).\nYou might use this to fill in runs from a time period when the Schedule was paused due to an external condition that's now resolved, or a period before the Schedule was created.\n\n### Limit number of Actions\n\nA Schedule can be limited to a certain number of scheduled Actions (that is, not trigger immediately).\nAfter that it will act as if it were paused.\n\n### Policies\n\nA Schedule supports a set of Policies that enable customizing behavior.\n\n#### Overlap Policy\n\nThe Overlap Policy controls what happens when it is time to start a Workflow Execution but a previously started Workflow Execution is still running.\nThe following options are available:\n\n- `Skip`: **Default**.\n  Nothing happens; the Workflow Execution is not started.\n- `BufferOne`: Starts the Workflow Execution as soon as the current one completes.\n  The buffer is limited to one.\n  If another Workflow Execution is supposed to start, but one is already in the buffer, only the one in the buffer eventually starts.\n- `BufferAll`: Allows an unlimited number of Workflows to buffer.\n  They are started sequentially.\n- `CancelOther`: Cancels the running Workflow Execution, and then starts the new one after the old one completes cancellation.\n- `TerminateOther`: Terminates the running Workflow Execution and starts the new one immediately.\n- `AllowAll` Starts any number of concurrent Workflow Executions.\n  With this policy (and only this policy), more than one Workflow Execution, started by the Schedule, can run simultaneously.\n\n#### Catchup Window\n\nThe Temporal Cluster might be down or unavailable at the time when a Schedule should take an Action.\nWhen it comes back up, the Catchup Window controls which missed Actions should be taken at that point.\nThe default is one minute, which means that the Schedule attempts to take any Actions that wouldn't be more than one minute late.\nAn outage that lasts longer than the Catchup Window could lead to missed Actions.\n(But you can always [Backfill](#backfill).)\n\n#### Pause-on-failure\n\nIf this policy is set, a Workflow Execution started by a Schedule that ends with a failure or timeout (but not Cancellation or Termination) causes the Schedule to automatically pause.\n\nNote that with the `AllowAll` Overlap Policy, this pause might not apply to the next Workflow Execution, because the next Workflow Execution might have started before the failed one finished.\nIt applies only to Workflow Executions that were scheduled to start after the failed one finished.\n\n### Last completion result\n\nA Workflow started by a Schedule can obtain the completion result from the most recent successful run.\n(How you do this depends on the SDK you're using.)\n\nFor overlap policies that don't allow overlap, “the most recent successful run” is straightforward to define.\nFor the `AllowAll` policy, it refers to the run that completed most recently, at the time that the run in question is started.\nConsider the following overlapping runs:\n\n```\ntime -------------------------------------------->\n A     |----------------------|\n B               |-------|\n C                          |---------------|\n D                                |--------------T\n```\n\nIf D asks for the last completion result at time T, it gets the result of A.\nNot B, even though B started more recently, because A completed later.\nAnd not C, even though C completed after A, because the result for D is captured when D is started, not when it's queried.\n\nFailures and timeouts do not affect the last completion result.\n\n### Last failure\n\nA Workflow started by a Schedule can obtain the details of the failure of the most recent run that ended at the time when the Workflow in question was started. Unlike last completion result, a _successful_ run _does_ reset the last failure.\n\n### Limitations\n\n:::info Experimental\n\nThe Scheduled Workflows feature is available in Temporal Server version 1.18.\n\nInternally, a Schedule is implemented as a Workflow.\nIf you're using Advanced Visibility (Elasticsearch), these Workflow Executions are hidden from normal views.\nIf you're using Standard Visibility, they are visible, though there's no need to interact with them directly.\n\n:::\n\nNative support for Schedules in language SDKs is coming soon.\nFor now, `tctl` and the web UI are the main interfaces to Schedules.\nFor advanced use, you can also use the gRPC API by getting a `WorkflowServiceClient` object from the SDK and calling methods such as `CreateSchedule`.\n","is_empty":false}}]},{"file_name":"how-to-manage-audit-logging.md","id":"how-to-manage-audit-logging","file_dir":"cloud","title":"How to manage Audit Logging in Temporal Cloud","sidebar_label":"Audit Logging","description":"Create, consume, and manage Audit Logs.","use_description":false,"toc_max_heading_level":4,"add_tabs_support":false,"sections":[{"type":"p","id":"concepts/what-is-audit-logging","node":{"file_name":"what-is-audit-logging.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/concepts/what-is-audit-logging.md","id":"concepts/what-is-audit-logging","title":"What is Audit Logging?","description":"Audit Logging is a feature that provides forensic access information for accounts, users, and Namespaces.","label":"Audit Logging","tags":["term","explanation"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAudit Logging is a feature of [Temporal Cloud](/concepts/what-is-temporal-cloud) that provides forensic access information at the account level, the user level, and the [Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace) level.\n\nAudit Logging answers \"who, when, and what\" questions about Temporal Cloud resources.\nThese answers can help you evaluate the security of your organization, and they can provide information that you need to satisfy audit and compliance requirements.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"cloud-context/audit-logging-supported-integrations","node":{"file_name":"audit-logging-supported-integrations.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/cloud-context/audit-logging-supported-integrations.md","id":"cloud-context/audit-logging-supported-integrations","title":"Which integrations are supported by Audit Logging?","description":"Audit Logging currently supports Amazon Kinesis.","label":"Supported integrations","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nAudit Logging supports the [Amazon Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) streaming-data platform.\nBy using [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html), you can route Temporal Audit Logs in [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/) (S3).\nWe plan to release additional integrations.\n","is_empty":false}},{"type":"h2","id":"cloud-context/audit-logging-supported-events","node":{"file_name":"audit-logging-supported-events.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/cloud-context/audit-logging-supported-events.md","id":"cloud-context/audit-logging-supported-events","title":"Which events are supported by Audit Logging?","description":"Audit Logging currently supports Admin Operation events.","label":"Supported events","tags":["guide-context"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nThe first release of Audit Logging supports Admin Operation events.\n\n### Admin Operation events\n\nThe following list specifies both the supported events and the Temporal APIs that emit the logs.\n\n- Account\n  -

This is useful for library-level code and implementation of DSLs.\n\nUse `Workflow.registerListener(Object)` to register an implementation of the `DynamicSignalListener` in the Workflow implementation code.\n\n```java\nWorkflow.registerListener(\n  (DynamicSignalHandler)\n      (signalName, encodedArgs) -> name = encodedArgs.get(0, String.class));\n```\n\nWhen registered, any Signals sent to the Workflow without a defined handler will be delivered to the `DynamicSignalHandler`.\nNote that you can only register one `Workflow.registerListener(Object)` per Workflow

before the `@WorkfowMethod`.\nYou must ensure that your code logic can deal with this.\n\nIn the following example, the Client code uses `SignalwithStart` to send the Signal `setCustomer` to the

@SignalMethod\n    void setCustomer(Customer customer);\n\n    @QueryMethod\n    Customer getCustomer();\n...\n}\n```\n\nNote that the Signal handler `setCustomer` is executed before the

The Activity provides the information necessary for completion from an external system and notifies the Temporal service that it is waiting for that outside callback.\n2. The external service calls the Temporal service to complete the Activity.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the first part:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART samples-php-async-activity-completion-activity-class-->\n[app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/GreetingActivity.php](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/blob/master/app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/GreetingActivity.php)\n```php\nclass GreetingActivity implements GreetingActivityInterface\n{\n    private LoggerInterface $logger;\n\n    public function __construct()\n    {\n        $this->logger = new Logger();\n    }\n    /**\n     * Demonstrates how to implement an Activity asynchronously.\n     * When {@link Activity::doNotCompleteOnReturn()} is called,\n     * the Activity implementation function that returns doesn't complete the Activity.\n     */\n    public function composeGreeting(string $greeting, string $name): string\n    {\n        // In real life this request can be executed anywhere.

Build from source.\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/temporalio/temporalite.git\n   cd temporalite\n   go build ./cmd/temporalite\n   ```\n2. Start Temporalite by using the `start` command.\n   ```bash\n   ./temporalite start --namespace default\n   ```\n   Replace `default` with your [Namespace Name](/namespaces).\n\n**Results**: You should have Temporal Cluster running at `http://127.0.0.1:7233` and the Temporal Web UI at [`http://127.0.0.1:8233`](http://127.0.0.1:8233/).\n\n<!-- For macOS users, if you receive the `error setting up schema: stat /Users/<user_name>/Library/Application Support/temporalite/db:` error, then create the folders `temporalite/db` in your `Application Support` library. -->\n\n### Docker Compose\n\nUse Docker Compose and Temporal Cluster Docker images to quickly install and run a Temporal Cluster locally while developing Temporal Applications.\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\nInstall [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).\n\n**Clone the repo and run Docker Compose**\n\nThe following steps start and run a Temporal Cluster using the default configuration.\n\n1. Clone the [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) repository.\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git\n   ```\n2. Change to the directory for the project.\n   ```bash\n   cd docker-compose\n   ```\n3. From your project directory, start your application.\n   ```bash\n   docker compose up\n   ```\n\n**Results**: You should have Temporal Cluster running at `http://127.0.0.1:7233` and the Temporal Web UI at [`http://127.0.0.1:8080`](http://127.0.0.1:8080/).\n\nTo try other configurations (different dependencies and databases), or to try a custom Docker image, follow the [temporalio/docker-compose README](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose/blob/main/README.md).\n\n### Gitpod\n\nRun a Temporal Cluster and develop Temporal Applications in your browser using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/).\n\nOne-click deployments are available for the [temporalio/samples-go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go) repo and the [temporalio/samples-typescript](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript) repo.\n\nA one-click deployment starts a Temporal Cluster using a Temporal Cluster Docker image, starts a Worker Process, and starts one of the application's sample Workflows.\n\nA one-click deployment can take up to a full minute to get fully up and running.\nWhen it is running, you can customize the

`WorkflowClient`, create a client-side `WorkflowStub`, and then call a Workflow method (annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`).\n\nTo start a Workflow Execution, your Temporal Server must be running, and your front-end service must be accepting gRPC calls.\n\nTo establish a connection with the front-end service, use `WorkflowServiceStubs`.\n\n```java\nWorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();\n```\n\nYou can provide `WorkflowServiceStubsOptions` to override the default values for the gRPC calls.\n\nFor example, the default front-end service gRPC address is set to `127.0.0.1:7233`, where `7233` is the default port for the Temporal Frontend Service.\n\nIf your server is running on a different host or port from the default, you can set it as shown in the following example.\n\n```java\nWorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newInstance(\n                    WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder()\n                     .setTarget(TARGET_ENDPOINT)\n                            .build());\n```\n\nAfter the connection to the Temporal Frontend Service is established, create a Client for the service stub.\nThe Workflow Client helps with client-side APIs and is required by Workers.\n\nCreate an instance of a `WorkflowClient` for the Workflow service stub, and use `WorkflowClientOptions` to set options for the Workflow Client.\nThe following example shows how to create a `WorkflowClient` instance called \"client\" for the `WorkflowServiceStubs` \"service\" that we created in the previous example, and set `Namespace` option for the `WorkflowClient`.\n\n```java\nWorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(\n                service,\n                WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder()\n                        .setNamespace(“Abc”)\n                    .build());\n```\n\nFor more information, see [WorkflowClientOptions](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClientOptions.Builder.html).\n\n`WorkflowService` and `WorkflowClient` creation is a heavyweight operation, and will be resource-intensive if created each time you start a Workflow or send a Signal to it.\nThe recommended way is to create them once and reuse where possible.\n\nWith the Client defined, you can start interacting with the Temporal Frontend Service.\n\nTo initialize a Workflow in the Client, create a `WorkflowStub`, and start the Workflow Execution with `WorkflowClient.start()`.\nStarting Workflows or sending Signals or Queries to Workflows from within a Client must be done using `WorkflowStubs`.\n\n```java\nWorkflowClient workflowClient =  WorkflowClient.newInstance(service, clientOptions);\n // Create a Workflow stub.\n YourWorkflow workflow = workflowClient.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class);\n // Start Workflow asynchronously and call its \"yourWFMethod\" Workflow method\n WorkflowClient.start(workflow::yourWFMethod);\n```\n\nFor more information, see the following:\n\n- [How to spawn a Workflow Execution in

[Activity](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/0.19.0/io/temporal/activity/Activity.html) Class implementing a specially annotated interface.\n\nAn Activity interface is annotated with `@ActivityInterface` and an Activity implementation implements this Activity interface.\nTo handle Activity types that do not have an explicitly registered handler, you can directly implement a dynamic Activity.\n\n```java\n@ActivityInterface\npublic interface GreetingActivities {\n    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);\n}\n```\n\nEach method defined in the Activity interface defines a separate Activity method.\nYou can annotate each method in the Activity interface with the `@ActivityMethod` annotation, but this is completely optional.\nThe following example uses the `@ActivityMethod` annotation for the method defined in the previous example.\n\n```java\n@ActivityInterface\npublic interface GreetingActivities {\n    @ActivityMethod\n    String

This means that `asyncio.CancelledError` will be raised (and can be caught, but it is not recommended).\n\nAn Activity must Heartbeat to receive cancellation.\n\n##### [Synchronous Activities](#synchronous-activities)\n\nThe [`activity_executor`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.WorkerConfig.html#activity_executor) Worker parameter must be set with a [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor) instance to use for executing the Activities.\n\nCancellation for synchronous Activities is done in the background and the Activity must choose to listen for it and react appropriately.\n\nAn Activity must Heartbeat to receive cancellation.\n\n- ###### [Synchronous Multithreaded Activities](#synchronous-multithreaded-activities)\n\nMultithreaded Activities are functions that use `activity_executor` set to an instance of [`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor).\n\nBesides `activity_executor`, no other additional Worker parameters are required for synchronous multithreaded Activities.\n\n- ###### [Synchronous Multiprocess/Other Activities](#synchronous-multiprocess)\n\nIf `activity_executor` is set to an instance of [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor) that is not `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, then the synchronous activities are considered multiprocess/other activities.\n\nThese require special primitives for heartbeating and cancellation. The `shared_state_manager` Worker parameter must be set to an instance of [`worker.SharedStateManager`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.SharedStateManager.html). The most common implementation can be created by passing a [`multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager) (for example, as a result of [`multiprocessing.managers.Manager()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Manager)) to [`worker.SharedStateManager.create_from_multiprocessing()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.SharedStateManager.html#create_from_multiprocessing).\n","is_empty":false}},{"lang":"typescript","id":"typescript/how-to-develop-an-activity-definition-in-typescript","node":{"file_name":"how-to-develop-an-activity-definition-in-typescript.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/how-to-develop-an-activity-definition-in-typescript.md","id":"typescript/how-to-develop-an-activity-definition-in-typescript","title":"How to develop an Activity Definition in TypeScript","description":"Develop an Activity Definition","label":"Develop an Activity Definition","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","typescript"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\n- Activities execute in the standard Node.js environment.\n- Activities cannot be in the same file as Workflows and must be separately registered.\n- Activities may be retried repeatedly, so you may need to use idempotency keys for critical side effects.\n\nActivities are _just functions_.

Workflow.","label":"Activity Execution","tags":["java","developer-guide"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nActivities are remote procedure calls that must be invoked from within a Workflow using `ActivityStub`.\nActivities are not executable on their own. You cannot start an Activity Execution by itself.\n\nNote that before an Activity Execution is invoked:\n\n- Activity options (either [`setStartToCloseTimeout`](/concepts/what-is-a-start-to-close-timeout) or [`ScheduleToCloseTimeout`](/concepts/what-is-a-schedule-to-close-timeout) are required) must be set for the Activity.\n  For details, see [Set Activity Options](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/java/how-to-set-activityoptions-in-java) and [Activity Options reference](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/java/reference-activityoptions).\n- The Activity must be registered with a Worker.\n  See [Worker Program](/java/how-to-develop-a-worker-program-in-java)\n- Activity code must be thread-safe.\n\nActivities should only be instantiated using stubs from within a Workflow.\nAn `ActivityStub` returns a client-side stub that implements an Activity interface.\nYou can invoke Activities using `Workflow.newActivityStub`(type-safe) or `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub` (untyped).\n\nCalling a method on the Activity interface schedules the Activity invocation with the Temporal service, and generates an [`ActivityTaskScheduled` Event](/concepts/what-is-an-event#activitytaskscheduled).\n\nActivities can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously.\n\n**Invoking Activities Synchronously**\n\nIn the following example, we use the type-safe `Workflow.newActivityStub` within the \"FileProcessingWorkflow\" Workflow implementation to create a client-side stub of the `FileProcessingActivities` class. We also define `ActivityOptions` and set `setStartToCloseTimeout` option to one hour.\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingWorkflowImpl implements FileProcessingWorkflow {\n\n    private final FileProcessingActivities activities;\n\n    public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {\n        this.activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(\n                FileProcessingActivities.class,\n                ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n                        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofHours(1))\n                        .build());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void processFile(Arguments args) {\n        String localName = null;\n        String processedName = null;\n        try {\n            localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());\n            processedName = activities.processFile(localName);\n            activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);\n        } finally {\n            if (localName != null) {\n                activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);\n            }\n            if (processedName != null) {\n                activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nA Workflow can have multiple Activity stubs. Each Activity stub can have its own `ActivityOptions` defined.\nThe following example shows a Workflow implementation with two typed Activity stubs.\n\n```java\npublic FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {\n    ActivityOptions options1 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n             .setTaskQueue(\"taskQueue1\")\n             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(10))\n             .build();\n    this.store1 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options1);\n\n    ActivityOptions options2 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n             .setTaskQueue(\"taskQueue2\")\n             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(5))\n             .build();\n    this.store2 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options2);\n}\n```\n\nTo invoke Activities inside Workflows without referencing the interface it implements, use an untyped Activity stub `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub`.\nThis is useful when the Activity type is not known at compile time, or to invoke Activities implemented in different programming languages.\n\n```java\n   // Workflow code\n    ActivityOptions activityOptions =\n        ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3))\n        .setTaskQueue(\"simple-queue-node\")\n        .build();\n\n    ActivityStub activity = Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub(activityOptions);\n    activity.execute(\"ComposeGreeting\", String.class, \"Hello World\" , \"Spanish\");\n```\n\n**Invoking Activities Asynchronously**\n\nSometimes Workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.\nThe Temporal Java SDK provides the `Async` class which includes static methods used to invoke any Activity asynchronously.\nThe calls return a result of type `Promise` which is similar to the Java `Future` and `CompletionStage`.\nWhen invoking Activities, use `Async.function` for Activities that return a result, and `Async.procedure` for Activities that return void.\n\nIn the following asynchronous Activity invocation, the method reference is passed to `Async.function` followed by Activity arguments.\n\n```java\nPromise<String> localNamePromise = Async.function(activities::download, sourceBucket, sourceFile);\n```\n\nThe following example shows how to call two Activity methods, \"download\" and \"upload\", in parallel on multiple files.\n\n```java\n  public void processFile(Arguments args) {\n    List<Promise<String>> localNamePromises = new ArrayList<>();\n    List<String> processedNames = null;\n    try {\n      // Download all files in parallel.\n      for (String sourceFilename : args.getSourceFilenames()) {\n        Promise<String> localName =\n            Async.function(activities::download, args.getSourceBucketName(), sourceFilename);\n        localNamePromises.add(localName);\n      }\n      List<String> localNames = new ArrayList<>();\n      for (Promise<String> localName : localNamePromises) {\n        localNames.add(localName.get());\n      }\n      processedNames = activities.processFiles(localNames);\n\n      // Upload all results in parallel.\n      List<Promise<Void>> uploadedList = new ArrayList<>();\n      for (String processedName : processedNames) {\n        Promise<Void> uploaded =\n            Async.procedure(\n                activities::upload,\n                args.getTargetBucketName(),\n                args.getTargetFilename(),\n                processedName);\n        uploadedList.add(uploaded);\n      }\n      // Wait for all uploads to complete.\n      Promise.allOf(uploadedList).get();\n    } finally {\n      for (Promise<String> localNamePromise : localNamePromises) {\n        // Skip files that haven't completed downloading.\n        if (localNamePromise.isCompleted()) {\n          activities.deleteLocalFile(localNamePromise.get());\n        }\n      }\n      if (processedNames != null) {\n        for (String processedName : processedNames) {\n          activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n**Activity Execution Context**\n\n`ActivityExecutionContext` is a context object passed to each Activity implementation by default.\nYou can access it in your Activity implementations via `Activity.getExecutionContext()`.\n\nIt provides getters to access information about the Workflow that invoked the Activity.\nNote that the Activity context information is stored in a thread-local variable.\nTherefore, calls to `getExecutionContext()` succeed only within the thread that invoked the Activity function.\n\nFollowing is an example of using the `ActivityExecutionContext`:\n\n```java\npublic class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {\n\n  @Override\n  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {\n\n    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();\n    ActivityInfo info = ctx.getInfo();\n\n    log.info(\"namespace=\" +  info.getActivityNamespace());\n    log.info(\"workflowId=\" + info.getWorkflowId());\n    log.info(\"runId=\" + info.getRunId());\n    log.info(\"activityId=\" + info.getActivityId());\n    log.info(\"activityTimeout=\" + info.getStartToCloseTimeout();\n\n    return downloadFileFromS3(bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);\n  }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nFor details on getting the results of an Activity Execution, see [Activity Execution

`ExternalWorkflowStub` to start a different Workflow Execution from within a Workflow.\n\nSee [`SignalwithStart`](/java/how-to-send-a-signal-with-start-in-java) to start a Workflow Execution to receive a Signal from within another Workflow.\n\n**Using `WorkflowStub`**\n\n`WorkflowStub` is a proxy generated by the `WorkflowClient`.\nEach time a new Workflow Execution is started, an instance of the Workflow implementation object is created.\nThen, one of the methods (depending on the Workflow Type of the instance) annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can be invoked.\nAs soon as this method returns, the Workflow Execution is considered to be complete.\n\nYou can use a typed or untyped `WorkflowStub` in the client code.\n\n- Typed `WorkflowStub` are useful because they are type safe and allow you to invoke your Workflow methods such as `@WorkflowMethod`, `@QueryMethod`, and `@SignalMethod` directly.\n- An untyped `WorkflowStub` does not use the Workflow interface, and is not type safe. It is more flexible because it has methods from the `WorkflowStub` interface, such as `start`, `signalWithStart`, `getResults` (sync and async), `query`, `signal`, `cancel` and `terminate`.\n  Note that the Temporal Java SDK also provides typed `WorkflowStub` versions for these methods.\n  When using untyped `WorkflowStub`, we rely on the Workflow Type, Activity Type, Child Workflow Type, as well as Query and Signal names.\n  For details, see [Temporal Client](/java/how-to-create-a-temporal-client-in-java).\n\nA Workflow Execution can be started either synchronously or asynchronously.\n\n- Synchronous invocation starts a Workflow and then waits for its completion. If the process that started the Workflow crashes or stops waiting, the Workflow continues executing.\n  Because Workflows are potentially long-running, and Client crashes happen, it is not very commonly found in production use.\n  The following example is a type-safe approach for starting a Workflow Execution synchronously.\n\n  ```java\n    NotifyUserAccounts workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(\n          NotifyUserAccounts.class,\n          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                  .setWorkflowId(\"notifyAccounts\")\n                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                  .build()\n          );\n\n  // start the Workflow and wait for a result.\n    workflow.notify(new String[] { \"Account1\", \"Account2\", \"Account3\", \"Account4\", \"Account5\",\n                  \"Account6\", \"Account7\", \"Account8\", \"Account9\", \"Account10\"});\n      }\n  // notify(String[] accountIds) is a Workflow method defined in the Workflow Definition.\n  ```\n\n- Asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller. This is the most common way to start Workflows in production code.\n  The `WorkflowClient` <https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClient.java)> provides some static methods, such as `start`, `execute`, `signalWithStart` etc., that help with starting your Workflows asynchronously.\n\n  The following examples show how to start Workflow Executions asynchronously, with either typed or untyped `WorkflowStub`.\n\n  - **Typed WorkflowStub Example**\n\n    ```java\n    // create typed Workflow stub\n    FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(FileProcessingWorkflow.class,\n          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                  .build());\n    // use WorkflowClient.execute to return future that contains Workflow result or failure, or\n    // use WorkflowClient.start to return WorkflowId and RunId of the started Workflow).\n    WorkflowClient.start(workflow::greetCustomer);\n    ```\n\n  - **Untyped WorkflowStub Example**\n\n    ```java\n    WorkflowStub untyped = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(\"FileProcessingWorkflow\",\n          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()\n                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)\n                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)\n                  .build());\n\n    // blocks until Workflow Execution has been started (not until it completes)\n    untyped.start(argument);\n    ```\n\nYou can call a Dynamic Workflow implementation using an untyped `WorkflowStub`.\nThe following example shows how to call the Dynamic Workflow implementation in the Client code.\n\n```java\n    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);\n    /**\n      * Note that for this part of the client code, the dynamic Workflow implementation must\n      * be known to the Worker at runtime in order to dispatch Workflow tasks, and may be defined\n      * in the Worker definition as:*/\n    // worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(DynamicGreetingWorkflowImpl.class);\n\n    /* Create the Workflow stub to call the dynamic Workflow.\n    * Note that the Workflow Type is not explicitly registered with the Worker.*/\n    WorkflowOptions workflowOptions =\n        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).setWorkflowId(WORKFLOW_ID).build();\n    WorkflowStub workflow = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(\"DynamicWF\", workflowOptions);\n```\n\n`DynamicWorkflow` can be used to invoke different Workflow Types.\nTo check what type is running when your Dynamic Workflow `execute` method runs, use `getWorkflowType()` in the implementation code.\n\n```java\nString type = Workflow.getInfo().getWorkflowType();\n```\n\nSee [Workflow Execution Result](/java/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-java) for details on how to get the results of the Workflow Execution.\n\n**Using `ExternalWorkflowStub`**\n\nUse `ExternalWorkflowStub` within a Workflow to invoke, and send Signals to, other Workflows by type.\n\nThis helps particularly for executing Workflows written in other language SDKs, as shown in the following example.\n\n```java\n@Override\n  public String yourWFMethod(String name) {\n      ExternalWorkflowStub callOtherWorkflow = Workflow.newUntypedExternalWorkflowStub(\"OtherWFId\");\n    }\n```\n\nSee the [Temporal Polyglot](https://github.com/tsurdilo/temporal-polyglot) code for examples of executing Workflows written in other language SDKs.\n\n**Recurring start**\n\nYou can start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule by using [`setCronSchedule`](/java/how-to-set-a-cron-schedule-in-java) Workflow option in the Client code.\n","is_empty":false}},{"lang":"php","id":"php/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-php","node":{"file_name":"how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-php.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-php.md","id":"php/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-php","title":"How to spawn a Workflow Execution in PHP","description":"Use the `Temporal\\Client\\WorkflowClient` to start a Workflow both synchronously and asynchronously.","label":"Workflow Execution","tags":["developer-guide","php"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nWorkflows can be started both synchronously and asynchronously.\nYou can use typed or untyped Workflows stubs available via `Temporal\\Client\\WorkflowClient`.\nTo create a Workflow Client:\n\n```php\nuse Temporal\\Client\\GRPC\\ServiceClient;\nuse Temporal\\Client\\WorkflowClient;\n\n$workflowClient = WorkflowClient::create(ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233'));\n```\n\n**Synchronous start**\n\nA synchronous start initiates a Workflow and then waits for its completion. The started Workflow will not rely on the\ninvocation process and will continue executing even if the waiting process crashes or stops.\n\nBe sure to acquire the Workflow interface or class name you want to start.\nFor example:\n\n```php\n#[WorkflowInterface]\ninterface AccountTransferWorkflowInterface\n{\n    #[WorkflowMethod(name: \"MoneyTransfer\")]\n    #[ReturnType('int')]\n    public function transfer(\n        string $fromAccountId,\n        string $toAccountId,\n        string $referenceId,\n        int $amountCents\n    );\n}\n```\n\nTo start the Workflow in sync mode:\n\n```php\n$accountTransfer = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(\n    AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class\n);\n\n$result = $accountTransfer->transfer(\n    'fromID',\n    'toID',\n    'refID',\n    1000\n);\n```\n\n**Asynchronous start**\n\nAn asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller without waiting for a result.\nThis is the most common way to start Workflows in a live environment.\n\nTo start a Workflow asynchronously, pass the Workflow stub instance and start parameters into the `WorkflowClient`->`start` method.\n\n```php\n$accountTransfer = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(\n    AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class\n);\n\n$run = $this->workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);\n```\n\nAfter the Workflow is started, you can receive the Workflow Id via the `WorkflowRun` object returned by the `start` method:\n\n```php\n$run = $workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);\n\nvar_dump($run->getExecution()->getID());\n```\n\n**Recurring start**\n\nYou can start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule with [the CronSchedule option](/app-dev-context/cron-jobs).\n","is_empty":false}},{"lang":"python","id":"python/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-python","node":{"file_name":"how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-python.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/python/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-python.md","id":"python/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-python","title":"How to spawn a Workflow Execution in Python","description":"Spawn a Workflow Execution","label":"Spawn a Workflow Execution","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","python"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTo start a Workflow Execution in Python, use either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods in the Client.\n\nThe following code example starts a Workflow and returns its handle.\n\n```python\nasync def main():\n    client = await Client.connect(\"127.0.0.1:7233\", namespace=\"your-custom-namespace\")\n\n    handle = await client.start_workflow(\n        \"your-workflow-name\",\n        \"some arg\",\n        id=\"your-workflow-id\",\n        task_queue=\"your-task-queue\",\n    )\n```\n\nThe following code example starts a Workflow and waits for completion.\n\n```python\nasync def main():\n    client = await Client.connect(\"127.0.0.1:7233\", namespace=\"your-custom-namespace\")\n\n    handle = await client.execute_workflow(\n        \"your-workflow-name\",\n        \"some arg\",\n        id=\"your-workflow-id\",\n        task_queue=\"your-task-queue\",\n    )\n```\n","is_empty":false}},{"lang":"typescript","id":"typescript/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-typescript","node":{"file_name":"how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-typescript.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-typescript.md","id":"typescript/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-typescript","title":"How to spawn a Workflow Execution in TypeScript","description":"Spawn a Workflow Execution","label":"Spawn a Workflow Execution","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","typescript"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nWhen you have a Workflow Client, you can schedule the start of a Workflow with `client.start()`, specifying `workflowId`, `taskQueue`, and `args` and returning a Workflow handle immediately after the Server acknowledges the receipt.\n\n```typescript\nconst handle = await client.start(example, {\n  workflowId: 'your-workflow-id',\n  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',\n  args: ['argument01', 'argument02', 'argument03'], // this is typechecked against workflowFn's args\n});\nconst handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);\nconst result = await handle.result();\n```\n\nCalling `client.start()` and `client.execute()` send a command to Temporal Server to schedule a new Workflow Execution on the specified Task Queue.

{\n   // ...\n }\n // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe instance of `WorkflowRun` has the following three methods:\n\n- `GetWorkflowID()`: Returns the Workflow Id of the invoked Workflow Execution.\n- `GetRunID()`: Always returns the Run Id of the initial Run (See [Continue As New](#)) in the series of Runs that make up the full Workflow Execution.\n- `Get`: Takes a pointer as a parameter and populates the

[`GetLastCompletionResult`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLastCompletionResult) APIs, available from the

For example:\n\n```java\nWorkflowStub workflowStub = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(workflowType, workflowOptions);\n\n// Returns the result after waiting for the Workflow to complete.\nString result = untyped.getResult(String.class);\n```\n\n**Get last (successful) completion result**\n\nFor a Temporal Cron Job, get the result of previous successful runs using `GetLastCompletionResult()`.\nThe method returns `null` if there is no previous completion.\nThe following example shows how to implement this in a Workflow.\n\n```java\npublic String cronWorkflow() {\n    String lastProcessedFileName = Workflow.getLastCompletionResult(String.class);\n\n    // Process work starting from the lastProcessedFileName.\n    // Business logic implementation goes here.\n    // Updates lastProcessedFileName to the new value.\n\n    return lastProcessedFileName;\n}\n```\n\nNote that this works even if one of the Cron schedule runs failed.\nThe next schedule will still get the last successful result if it ever successfully completed at least once.\nFor example, for a daily cron Workflow, if the run succeeds on the first day and fails on the second day, then the third day run will get the result from first day's run using these APIs.\n","is_empty":false}},{"lang":"php","id":"php/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-php","node":{"file_name":"how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-php.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/php/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-php.md","id":"php/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-php","title":"How to get the result of an Workflow Execution in PHP","label":"Workflow Execution","ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nIf you need to wait for the completion of a Workflow after an asynchronous start, make a blocking call to\nthe `WorkflowRun`->`getResult` method.\n\n```php\n$run = $workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);\n\nvar_dump($run->getResult());\n```\n","is_empty":false}},{"lang":"python","id":"python/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-python","node":{"file_name":"how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-python.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/python/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-python.md","id":"python/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-python","title":"How to get the result of a Workflow Execution in python","description":"Workflow Execution result","label":"Workflow Execution result","tags":["developer-guide","python"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nUse [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`get_workflow_handle()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle) to return a Workflow handle.\nThen use the [`result`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.workflowhandle#result) method to await on the result of the Workflow.\n\n```python\nhandle = await client.start_workflow(\n    YourWorkflow.run, \"some arg\", id=\"your-workflow-id\", task_queue=\"your-task-queue\"\n)\n\n# Wait for result\nresult = await handle.result()\nprint(f\"Result: {result}\")\n```\n\nTo get a handle for an existing Workflow by its Id, you can use [`get_workflow_handle()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle), or use [`get_workflow_handle_for()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle_for) for type safety.\n\nThen use [`describe()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.workflowhandle#describe) to get the current status of the Workflow.\nIf the Workflow does not exist, this call fails.\n","is_empty":false}},{"lang":"typescript","id":"typescript/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-typescript","node":{"file_name":"how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-typescript.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/typescript/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-typescript.md","id":"typescript/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-typescript","title":"How to get the result of a Workflow Execution in TypeScript","description":"Get the result of a Workflow Execution","label":"Workflow result","tags":["developer-guide","sdk","typescript"],"ssdi":[],"markdown_content":"\nTo return the results of a Workflow Execution:\n\n```typescript\nreturn (\n  'Completed '\n  + wf.workflowInfo().workflowId\n  + ', Total Charged: '\n  + totalCharged\n);\n```\n\n`totalCharged` is just a function declared in your code.

everything from starting a Workflow to Workflow Execution to running an Activity from that Workflow.\n\nThe built-in tracing uses protobuf message headers (like [this one](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/b2b8ae6592a8730dd5be6d90569d1aea84e1712f/temporal/api/workflowservice/v1/request_response.proto#L161) when starting a Workflow) to propagate the tracing information from the client to the Workflow and from the Workflow to its successors (when Continued As New), children, and Activities.\nAll of these executions are linked with a single trace identifier and have the proper `parent -> child` span relation.\n\nTracing is compatible between different Temporal SDKs as long as compatible [context propagators](https://opentelemetry.lightstep.com/core-concepts/context-propagation/) are used.\n\n**Context propagation**\n\nThe TypeScript SDK uses the global OpenTelemetry propagator.\n\nTo extend the default ([Trace Context](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/packages/opentelemetry-core/README.md#w3ctracecontextpropagator-propagator) and [Baggage](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/packages/opentelemetry-core/README.md#baggage-propagator) propagators) to also include the [Jaeger propagator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger), follow these steps:\n\n- `npm i @opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger`\n\n- At the top level of your Workflow code, add the following lines:\n\n  ```js\n  import { propagation } from '@opentelemetry/api';\n  import {\n    CompositePropagator,\n    W3CBaggagePropagator,\n    W3CTraceContextPropagator,\n  } from

Workflows run in a sandboxed environment and cannot do any I/O.\n1. Workflow code might get replayed at any time, generating duplicate log messages.\n\nTo work around these limitations, we recommend using the Sinks feature in the TypeScript SDK.\nSinks enable one-way export of logs, metrics, and traces from the Workflow isolate to the Node.js environment.\n\n<!--\nWorkflows in Temporal may be replayed from the beginning of their history when resumed. In order for Temporal to recreate the exact state Workflow code was in, the code is required to be fully deterministic. To prevent breaking [determinism](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/determinism), in the TypeScript SDK, Workflow code runs in an isolated execution environment and may not use any of the Node.js APIs or communicate directly with the outside world. -->\n\nSinks are written as objects with methods. Similar to Activities, they are declared in the Worker and then proxied in Workflow code, and it helps to share types between both.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Comparing Sinks, Activities and Interceptors</summary>\n\nSinks are similar to Activities in that they are both registered on the Worker and proxied into the Workflow.\nHowever, they differ from Activities in important ways:\n\n- Sink functions don't return any value back to the Workflow and cannot not be awaited.\n- Sink calls are not recorded in Workflow histories (no timeouts or retries).\n- Sink functions are _always_ run on the same Worker that runs the Workflow they are called from.\n\n</details>\n\n**Declaring the Sink Interface**\n\nExplicitly declaring a Sink's interface is optional, but is useful for ensuring type safety in subsequent steps:\n\n<!--SNIPSTART

LoggerSinks;\n```\n<!--SNIPEND-->\n\n**Implementing Sinks**\n\nImplementing Sinks is a two-step process.\n\nImplement and inject the Sink function into a Worker\n\n<!--SNIPSTART

[InjectedSinkFunction](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.InjectedSinkFunction) interface:\n\n- **Injected WorkflowInfo argument**: The first argument of a Sink function implementation is a [`workflowInfo` object](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowInfo/) that contains useful metadata.\n- **Limited arguments types**: The remaining Sink function arguments are copied between the sandbox and the Node.js environment using the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm).\n- **No return value**: To prevent breaking determinism, Sink functions cannot return values to the Workflow.\n\n**Advanced: Performance considerations and non-blocking Sinks**\n\nThe injected sink function contributes to the overall Workflow Task processing duration.\n\n- If you have a long-running sink function, such as one that tries to communicate with external services, you might start seeing Workflow Task timeouts.\n- The effect is multiplied when using `callDuringReplay: true` and replaying long Workflow histories because the Workflow Task timer starts when the first history page is delivered to the

Workers and Clients**\n\nThe Worker comes with a default logger which defaults to log any messages with level `INFO` and higher to `STDERR` using `console.error`.\nThe following [log levels](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/worker#loglevel) are listed in increasing order of severity.\n\n**Customizing the default logger**\n\nTemporal uses a [`DefaultLogger`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.DefaultLogger/) that implements the basic interface:\n\n```ts\nimport { DefaultLogger, Runtime } from '@temporalio/worker';\n\nconst logger = new DefaultLogger('WARN', ({ level, message }) => {\n  console.log(`Custom logger: ${level} — ${message}`);\n});\nRuntime.install({ logger });\n```\n\nThe previous code example sets the default logger to only log messages with level `WARN` and higher.\n\n**Accumulate logs for testing and reporting**\n\n```ts\nimport { DefaultLogger, LogEntry } from '@temporalio/worker';\n\nconst logs: LogEntry[] = [];\nconst logger = new DefaultLogger('TRACE', (entry) => logs.push(entry));\nlog.debug('hey', { a: 1 });\nlog.info('ho');\nlog.warn('lets', { a: 1 });\nlog.error('go');\n```\n\nA common logging use case is logging to a file to be picked up by a collector like the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/nodejs/?tab=winston30).\n\n```ts\nimport { Runtime } from '@temporalio/worker';\nimport winston from 'winston';\n\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  level: 'info',\n  format: winston.format.json(),\n  transports: [new transports.File({ filename:

$factory->newWorker();\n\n$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(MyWorkflow::class);\n$worker->registerActivity(MyActivity::class);\n$factory->run();\n```\n\nThen, in your tests to mock an Activity, use the`ActivityMocker` class.\n\nAssume we have the following Activity:\n\n```php\n#[ActivityInterface(prefix: \"SimpleActivity.\")]\ninterface SimpleActivityInterface\n{\n    #[ActivityMethod('doSomething')]\n    public function doSomething(string $input): string;\n```\n\nTo mock it in the test, you can do this:\n\n```php\nfinal class SimpleWorkflowTestCase extends

    $this->activityMocks->clear();\n        parent::tearDown();\n    }\n\n    public function testWorkflowReturnsUpperCasedInput(): void\n    {\n        $this->activityMocks->expectCompletion('SimpleActivity.doSomething', 'world');\n        $workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(SimpleWorkflow::class);\n        $run =

exact state of a Workflow Execution.\nYou can replay a Workflow from the beginning of its Event History.\n\nReplay succeeds only if the [Workflow Definition](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition) is compatible with the provided history from a deterministic point of view.\n\nWhen you test changes to your Workflow Definitions, we recommend doing the following as part of your CI checks:\n\n1. Determine which Workflow Types or Task Queues (or both) will be targeted by the Worker code under test.\n2. Download the Event Histories of a representative set of recent open and closed Workflows from each Task Queue, either programmatically using the SDK client or via `tctl`.\n3. Run the Event Histories through replay.\n4.

existing Workflow Execution from its Event History to replicate errors.\n\nFor example, the following code retrieves the Event History of a Workflow:\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\n\t\"go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1\"\n\t\"go.temporal.io/api/history/v1\"\n\t\"go.temporal.io/sdk/client\"\n)\n\nfunc GetWorkflowHistory(ctx context.Context, client client.Client, id, runID string) (*history.History, error) {\n\tvar hist history.History\n\titer := client.GetWorkflowHistory(ctx, id, runID, false, enums.HISTORY_EVENT_FILTER_TYPE_ALL_EVENT)\n\tfor iter.HasNext() {\n\t\tevent, err := iter.Next()\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn nil, err\n\t\t}\n\t\thist.Events = append(hist.Events, event)\n\t}\n\treturn &hist, nil\n}\n```\n\nThis history can then be used to _replay_.\nFor example, the following code creates a `WorkflowReplayer` and register the `YourWorkflow` Workflow function.\nThen it calls the `ReplayWorkflowHistory` to _replay_ the Event History and return an error code.\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\n\t\"go.temporal.io/sdk/client\"\n\t\"go.temporal.io/sdk/worker\"\n)\n\nfunc ReplayWorkflow(ctx context.Context, client client.Client, id, runID string) error {\n\thist, err := GetWorkflowHistory(ctx, client, id, runID)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\treplayer := worker.NewWorkflowReplayer()\n\treplayer.RegisterWorkflow(YourWorkflow)\n\treturn replayer.ReplayWorkflowHistory(nil, hist)\n}\n```\n\nThe code above will cause the Worker to re-execute the Workflow's Workflow Function using the original Event History.\nIf a noticeably different code path was followed or some code caused a deadlock, it will be returned in the error code.\nReplaying a Workflow Execution locally is a good way to see exactly what code path was taken for given input and events.\n\nYou can replay many Event Histories by registering all the needed Workflow implementation and then calling `ReplayWorkflowHistory` repeatedly.\n","is_empty":false}},{"lang":"java","id":"java/how-to-replay-a-workflow-execution-in-java","node":{"file_name":"how-to-replay-a-workflow-execution-in-java.md","file_path":"/Users/ssantiago/Documents/documentation/docs-src/java/how-to-replay-a-workflow-execution-in-java.md","id":"java/how-to-replay-a-workflow-execution-in-java","title":"How
