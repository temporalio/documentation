Implementing CI/CD pipelines and deployment of applications to containers or virtual or physical machines is a non-trivial process.
Its business logic has to deal with complex requirements around rolling upgrades, canary deployments, and rollbacks.
Temporal is a perfect platform for building a deployment solution because it provides all the necessary guarantees and abstractions
allowing developers to focus on the business logic.

Example production systems:

* Uber internal deployment infrastructure
* Update push to IoT devices
