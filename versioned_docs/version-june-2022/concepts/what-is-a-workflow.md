In day-to-day conversations, the term _Workflow_ frequently denotes either a [Workflow Type](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-type), a [Workflow Definition](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition), or a [Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution).
Temporal documentation aims to be explicit and differentiate between them.
