A Temporal Client is available in each SDK and provides a set of APIs to communicate with a [Temporal Cluster](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster).

The most common operations that a Temporal Client enables you to perform are the following:

- Start a Workflow Execution.
- Get the result of Workflow Execution.
- Signal a Workflow Execution.
- Query a Workflow Execution.
- List Workflow Executions.
