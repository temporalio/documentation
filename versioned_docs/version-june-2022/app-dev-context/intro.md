This guide is meant to be a comprehensive resource for developing a [Temporal Application](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-application).

It is broken down into two large sections:

- [Foundations](#foundations): The minimum things required to build and run a simple Workflow with a single Activity.
- [Features](#features): All the general features available to a Temporal Application.
