Activity Execution semantics rely on several parameters.
The only required custom value that needs to be set is either a [Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-start-to-close-timeout) or a [Start-To-Close Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-start-to-close-timeout).
These parameters are set in the Activity Options.
