Many applications listen to multiple event sources, update the state of correspondent business entities,
and have to execute actions if some state is reached.
Temporal is a good fit for many of these. It has direct support for asynchronous events (aka signals),
has a simple programming model that obscures a lot of complexity
around state persistence, and ensures external action execution through built-in retries.

Real-world examples:

* Fraud detection where workflow reacts to events generated by consumer behavior
* Customer loyalty program where the workflow accumulates reward points and applies them when requested
