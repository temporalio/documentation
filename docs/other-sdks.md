There is demand for other Temporal SDKs other than Go and Java. The user community has taken initiative to build some of these, but please note that they are not officially supported or endorsed by Temporal unless explicitly mentioned:

- [Ruby SDK by Coinbase](https://github.com/coinbase/temporal-ruby)
- Python SDK - please get in touch with us
- Swift SDK - please get in touch with us
- C#/.Net SDK - please get in touch with us
- Node.js SDK - please get in touch with us
- Rust SDK - please get in touch with us
- C++ SDK - please get in touch with us

If you are interested in using an unofficial SDK, we recommend that you reach out to any of us at Temporal. We are very excited by the community's enthusiasm and strongly believe in collaborating on open source projects. Our goal is to make sure there is maintenance leadership in place to care for the developer experience over the long term.
