There is demand for other Temporal SDKs other than Go and Java. The user community has taken initiative to build some of these, but please note that they are not officially supported or endorsed by Temporal unless explicitly mentioned:

- [Ruby SDK by Coinbase](https://github.com/coinbase/temporal-ruby)
- Python SDK - please get in touch with us
- Swift SDK - please get in touch with us
- C#/.Net SDK - please get in touch with us
- Node.js SDK - please get in touch with us
- Rust SDK - please get in touch with us
- C++ SDK - please get in touch with us

We are very excited by the interest of the community, but please don't go too far without getting in touch with us! Collaboration via open source is something we strongly believe in, but we also care about the long term developer experience and therefore likely will want to take on maintenance leadership of SDKs in key languages.
