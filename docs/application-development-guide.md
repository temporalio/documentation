This guide is meant to be a comprehensive overview of Temporal concepts.

:::caution

This guide is a work in progress.
Some sections may be incomplete or missing for some languages.

:::

This guide is meant to be a comprehensive resource for developing a [Temporal Application](/docs/concepts-guide/#temporal-application).

It is broken down into five large sections:

- [Foundations](#foundations): The minimum things required to build and run a simple Workflow with a single Activity.
- [Features](#features): All of the general features available to a Temporal Application.
- [Observability](#observability): Features and tools available that give you insight into you application.
- [Testing](#testing): How to test your Temporal Application code.
- [Scaling](#scaling): Things to consider and look for when scaling a Temporal Application to millions or billions of Workflow Executions.

## Foundations

This section covers the minimum set of concepts and implementation details needed to build and run a simple [Temporal Application](/docs/concepts-guide/#temporal-application).

### Run a dev Cluster

Whenever we are developing Temporal Applications, we want to have a [Temporal Cluster](/docs/concepts-guide/#clusters) up and running.
We can interact with a Cluster through [Temporal Client](/docs/concepts-guide/#temporal-sdk/#what-is-a-temporal-client) APIs and [tctl](/docs/tctl) commands.

There are four ways to quickly install and run a Temporal Cluster:

- [Docker](#docker): Using Docker Compose makes it easy to develop your Temporal Application locally.
- [Render](#render): Our [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) experience has been translated to Render's Blueprint format for an alternative cloud connection.
- [Helm charts](#helm-charts): Deploying a Cluster to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an easy way to test the system and develop Temporal Applications.
- [Gitpod](#gitpod): One-click deployments are available for Go and TypeScript.

**We do not recommend using any of these methods in a [full (production) environment](/docs/server/production-deployment).**

#### Helm charts

Use [Temporal Helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts) to deploy the Temporal Server to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.

Deploying the Temporal Cluster with Helm is not recommended for a production environment, but it is a great way to test the system while developing Workflows.

#### Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose and Temporal Cluster Docker images to quickly install and run a Temporal Cluster locally while developing Workflows.

You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed.

Then clone the [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) repository and run `docker-compose up` from the root of that repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
cd  docker-compose
docker-compose up
```

When the Temporal Cluster is running, the Temporal Web UI becomes available in your browser: [localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088/)

The preceding steps start and run a Temporal Cluster using a default configuration.
To try other configurations (different dependencies and databases), or to try a custom Docker image, follow the [temporalio/docker-compose README](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose/blob/main/README.md).

#### Render

[temporal-render-simple](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-render-simple) translates our docker-compose to Render by using the [Auto-Setup Docker image](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup).
We do not recommend using this technique for production because all four Temporal internal services (Frontend, Matching, History, and Worker) are run in one process, but the benefit is one-click deployments.

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-render-simple)

#### Gitpod

You can run a Temporal Cluster and develop Temporal Applications in your browser using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

One-click deployments are available for the [temporalio/samples-go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go) repo and the [temporalio/samples-typescript](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript) repo.

A one-click deployment starts a Temporal Cluster using a Temporal Cluster Docker image, starts a Worker Process, and starts one of the application's sample Workflows.

It can take up to a full minute for the one-click deployments to get fully up and running.
When it is running, you can customize the application samples.

### Develop Workflows

Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a [Workflow Definition](/docs/concepts-guide/#workflow-definition).

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, a [Workflow Definition](/docs/concepts-guide/#workflow-definition) is an exportable function.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context) error {
  // ...
  return nil
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

In the Temporal Java SDK programming model, a Workflow is a class which implements a Workflow interface:

```java
public class FileProcessingWorkflowImpl implements FileProcessingWorkflow {
  // ...
}
```

#### Workflow interface

The Workflow interface is a Java interface and is annotated with `@WorkflowInterface`.
Each Workflow interface method must have one [`@WorkflowMethod`](#workflowmethod).

Use `@SignalMethod` for Signals, and `@QueryMethod` for Queries in the Workflow.
See [Signals](/docs/java/signals) and [Queries](/docs/java/queries) for details.

Use `ExternalWorkflowStub` to start other Workflow Executions, or send Signals to other running Workflows.
See [Workflow Execution](/docs/java/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-java/#Using`ExternalWorkflowStub`) for details.

To call Activities in your Workflow, see [Activity Definition](#develop-activities) and [Activity Execution](#spawn-activity-execution).

You can also invoke other Workflows as Child Workflows with `Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub()` or `Workflow.newUntypedChildWorkflowStub()` within a Workflow Definition.
See [Child Workflow Execution](/docs/java/how-to-spawn-a-child-workflow-execution-in-java) for details.

The following example shows how to use the annotations in a Workflow interface:

```java
@WorkflowInterface
public interface FileProcessingWorkflow {

    @WorkflowMethod
    String processFile(Arguments args);

    @QueryMethod(name="history")
    List<String> getHistory();

    @QueryMethod
    String getStatus();

    @SignalMethod
    void retryNow();

    @SignalMethod
    void abandon();
}
```

#### `@WorkflowMethod`

The `@WorkflowMethod` identifies the method that is the starting point of the Workflow Execution. The [Workflow Execution](/docs/concepts-guide/#workflow-execution) completes when this method completes.

A Workflow Definition interface in Java can have only one method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`. It can be used to denote the [Workflow Type](/docs/concepts-guide/#workflow-type).

The Workflow Type defaults to the short name of the Workflow interface. In the following example, the Workflow Type defaults to "NotifyUserAccounts".

```java
  @WorkflowInterface

  public interface NotifyUserAccounts {
    @WorkflowMethod
    void notify(String[] accountIds);
}
```

To overwrite this default naming and assign a custom Workflow Type, use the `@WorkflowMethod` annotation with the `name` parameter.
In the following example, the Workflow Type is set to "Abc".

```java
@WorkflowInterface

  public interface NotifyUserAccounts {
  @WorkflowMethod(name = "Abc")
  void notify(String[] accountIds);
  }
```

When you set the Workflow Type this way, the value of the `name` parameter does not have to start with an uppercase letter.

A method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can have any number of parameters. We recommend passing a single parameter that contains all the input fields. This allows adding fields in a backward-compatible manner.
Note that all inputs should be serializable by the default Jackson JSON Payload Converter.

A Workflow Type can be registered only once per Worker entity.
If you define multiple Workflow implementations of the same type, you get an exception at the time of registration.

#### Workflow interface inheritance

Workflow interfaces can form inheritance hierarchies, which can be useful for creating components that can be reused across multiple Workflow interfaces.
For example, to implement a UI or CLI button that sends a `retryNow` Signal to any Workflow, define the method as follows:

```java
public interface Retryable {
    @SignalMethod
    void retryNow();
}

@WorkflowInterface
public interface FileProcessingWorkflow extends Retryable {

    @WorkflowMethod
    String processFile(Arguments args);

    @QueryMethod(name="history")
    List<String> getHistory();

    @QueryMethod
    String getStatus();

    @SignalMethod
    void abandon();
}
```

By using this approach, another Workflow interface can extend just `Retryable`:

```java
@WorkflowInterface
public interface MediaProcessingWorkflow extends Retryable {

    @WorkflowMethod
    String processBlob(Arguments args);
}
```

Note that this approach does not apply to `@WorkflowMethod` annotations. This means that, when using a base interface, it should not include any `@WorkflowMethod` methods.
To illustrate this, let's say that we define the following _invalid_ code:

```java
// INVALID CODE!
public interface BaseWorkflow {
    @WorkflowMethod
    void retryNow();
}

@WorkflowInterface
public interface Workflow1 extends BaseWorkflow {}

@WorkflowInterface
public interface Workflow2 extends BaseWorkflow {}
```

Attempting to register implementations of _Workflow1_ and _Workflow2_ with a Worker will fail.
For example, if we tried to register the _Workflow1_ and _Workflow2_ as shown:

```java
worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(
        Workflow1Impl.class, Workflow2Impl.class);
```

This registration fails with the following message:

```text
java.lang.IllegalStateException: BaseWorkflow workflow type is already registered with the worker
```

#### Workflow implementation

A Workflow implementation implements a Workflow interface.
Each time a new Workflow Execution is started, an instance of the Workflow implementation object is created.
Then, one of the methods (depending on the Workflow Type of the instance) annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can be invoked.
As soon as this method returns, the Workflow Execution is considered to be complete.

Workflow methods annotated with `@QueryMethod` and `@SignalMethod` can be invoked during a Workflow Execution.
Note that methods annotated with `@QueryMethod` can be invoked even when a Workflow is in the `Completed` state.

#### Typed and Untyped `WorkflowStubs`

A `WorkflowStub` is a proxy of your Workflow implementation. To start a Workflow Execution, we need to create a `WorkflowStub`.
There are two types of `WorkflowStubs`: Typed and Untyped.

**Typed `WorkflowStubs`**

A typed `WorkflowStub` returns an implementation of your Workflow interface. For example consider the following Workflow interface:

```java
@WorkflowInterface
public interface NotifyUserAccounts {
    @WorkflowMethod
    void notifyAccount(String[] accountIds);

    @QueryMethod
    int getCount();
}
```

The Workflow implementation for the preceding Workflow interface using typed `WorkflowStub` will be as follows:

```java
Public static void main(String[] args){
NotifyUserAccounts workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(
      NotifyUserAccounts.class,
      WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
            .setWorkflowId("notifyAccounts")
            .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
            .build()
        );
}
```

Typed `WorkflowStub` are useful because they are type safe. You can invoke your Workflow methods such as [`@WorkflowMethod`](#`@WorkflowMethod`), [`@QueryMethod`](#`@QueryMethod`), and [`@SignalMethod`](#@SignalMethod`) directly.

**Untyped `WorkflowStub`**

An untyped `WorkflowStub` does not use the Workflow interface, and is not type safe. It is more flexible because it has methods from the `WorkflowStub` interface, such as `start`, `signalWithStart`, `getResults` (sync and async), `query`, `signal`, `cancel` and `terminate`.
Note that the Temporal Java SDK also provides typed `WorkflowStub` versions for these methods.

When using untyped `WorkflowStubs`, we rely on the Workflow Type, Activity Type, Child Workflow Type, as well as Query and Signal names.

- `WorkflowStub.java` reference: <https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/WorkflowStub.java>

#### Calling other Workflows

To interact with other running Workflow Executions from within the Workflow, use `ExternalWorkflowStub`.
To interact with Child Workflows, use `ChildWorkflowStub`.

See [Workflow Execution](/docs/java/how-to-spawn-a-workflow-execution-in-java) and [Child Workflow Execution](/docs/java/how-to-spawn-a-child-workflow-execution-in-java) for details.

#### Dynamic Workflows

Use `DynamicWorkflow` to implement Workflow Types dynamically. When you register a Workflow implementation type that extends `DynamicWorkflow`, it can be used to implement any Workflow Type that is not explicitly registered with the Worker.

The main use case for `DynamicWorkflow` is an implementation of custom Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). A single implementation can implement a Workflow Type which by definition is dynamically loaded from some external source.
You can also use `DynamicWorkflow` when you need a default Workflow that can handle all Workflow Types that are not registered with a Worker.

The Dynamic Workflow interface is implemented with the `execute` method. This method takes in `EncodedValues` that are inputs to the Workflow Execution. These inputs can be specified by the Client when invoking the Workflow Execution.

```java
public class MyDynamicWorkflow implements DynamicWorkflow {
   @Override
    public Object execute(EncodedValues args) {
    }
}
```

The `DynamicWorkflow` must be registered with a Worker.
The following rules apply when registering a Dynamic Workflow with a Worker:

- Only one Workflow implementation that extends `DynamicWorkflow` can be registered with a Worker.
- You can register multiple type-specific Workflow implementations alongside a single `DynamicWorkflow` implementation.
- Implement the `execute` method for Dynamic Workflow implementations. Do not specify a `@WorkflowMethod` when using Dynamic Workflows.
- Implement Signals and Queries dynamically.

  Example for implementing Signal handler dynamically:

  ```java
        Workflow.registerListener(
          (DynamicSignalHandler)
              (signalName, encodedArgs) -> name = encodedArgs.get(0, String.class));
  ```

  Example for implementing Query handler dynamically:

  ```java
        Workflow.registerListener(
          (DynamicQueryHandler)
              (queryType, encodedArgs) -> {
              return name;
      });
  ```

  Note that `DynamicSignalHandler` and `DynamicQueryHandler` can also be implemented in regular Workflow implementations.

- Because `DynamicWorkflow` can be invoked for different Workflow Types, to check what type is running when your Dynamic Workflow `execute` method runs, use:

  ```java
  String type = Workflow.getInfo().getWorkflowType();
  ```

- All standard `WorkflowOptions` apply to Dynamic Workflows.
- All the determinism rules apply to Workflows that implement this interface.

The following example shows a Dynamic Workflow Implementation.

```java
// Dynamic Workflow Implementation
public static class DynamicGreetingWorkflowImpl implements DynamicWorkflow {
  private String name;

  @Override
  public Object execute(EncodedValues args) {
    String greeting = args.get(0, String.class);
    String type = Workflow.getInfo().getWorkflowType();

    // Register dynamic Signal handler
    Workflow.registerListener(
        (DynamicSignalHandler)
            (signalName, encodedArgs) -> name = encodedArgs.get(0, String.class));

    // Register dynamic Query handler
    Workflow.registerListener(
    (DynamicQueryHandler)
        (queryType, encodedArgs) -> {
        return name;
        });
  }
```

The following example shows how to register the Dynamic Workflow implementation with a Worker and the Client code for how to start a Workflow Eecution.

```java
  public static void main(String[] arg) {

    WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newInstance();
    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
    WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);
    Worker worker = factory.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE);

    /* Register the Dynamic Workflow implementation with the Worker. Workflow implementations
    ** must be known to the Worker at runtime in order to dispatch Workflow Tasks.
    */
    worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(DynamicGreetingWorkflowImpl.class);

    // Start all the Workers that are in this process.
    factory.start();

    /* Create the Workflow stub. Note that the Workflow type is not explicitly registered with the Worker */
    WorkflowOptions workflowOptions =
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).setWorkflowId(WORKFLOW_ID).build();
    WorkflowStub workflow = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub("DynamicWF", workflowOptions);

    /* Start Workflow Execution and Signal right after. Pass in the Workflow args and Signal args */
    workflow.signalWithStart("greetingSignal", new Object[] {"John"}, new Object[] {"Hello"});

    // Wait for the Workflow to finish getting the results
    String result = workflow.getResult(String.class);

    System.out.println(result);

    System.exit(0);
  }
}
```

#### Workflow implementation constraints

The following constraints apply when writing Workflow Definitions:

- Do not use mutable global variables in your Workflow implementations.
  This will assure that multiple Workflow instances are fully isolated.
- Do not call non-deterministic functions (such as non-seeded random or `UUID.randomUUID()`) directly from the Workflow code.
  The Temporal SDK provides specific API for calling non-deterministic code in your Workflows.
- Do not use programming language constructs that rely on system time.
  For example, only use `Workflow.currentTimeMillis()` to get the current time inside a Workflow.
- Do not use native Java `Thread` or any other multi-threaded classes like `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
  Use `Async.function` or `Async.procedure`, provided by the Temporal SDK, to execute code asynchronously.
- Do not use synchronization, locks, or other standard Java blocking concurrency-related classes besides those provided by the Workflow class.
  There is no need for explicit synchronization because multi-threaded code inside a Workflow is executed one thread at a time and under a global lock.
  - Call `Workflow.sleep` instead of `Thread.sleep`.
  - Use `Promise` and `CompletablePromise` instead of `Future` and `CompletableFuture`.
  - Use `WorkflowQueue` instead of `BlockingQueue`.
- Use `Workflow.getVersion` when making any changes to the Workflow code.
  Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code might break already running Workflows.
- Do not access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow Execution path.
  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.

#### Parameters

TODO

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

The first parameter of a Go-based Workflow Definition must be of the [`workflow.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/workflow#Context) type, as it is used by the Temporal Go SDK to pass around Workflow Execution context, and virtually all the Go SDK APIs that are callable from the Workflow require it.
It is acquired from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/workflow) package.

```go
import (
    "go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param string) error {
  // ...
}
```

The `workflow.Context` entity operates similarly to the standard `context.Context` entity provided by Go.
The only difference between `workflow.Context` and `context.Context` is that the `Done()` function, provided by `workflow.Context`, returns `workflow.Channel` instead of the standard Go `chan`.

The second parameter, `string`, is a custom parameter that is passed to the Workflow when it is invoked.
A Workflow Definition may support multiple custom parameters, or none. These parameters can be regular type variabes or safe pointers.
However, the best practice is to pass a single parameter that is of a `struct` type so there can be some backward compatibility if new parameters are added.

```go
type YourWorkflowParam struct {
  WorkflowParamFieldOne string
  WorkflowParamFieldTwo int
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {
  // ...
}
```

All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable, regardless of whether pointers or regular type values are used. Parameters can’t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers.

#### Return values

values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

A Go-based Workflow Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination.
Again, the best practice here is to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values.

```go
type YourWorkflowResponse struct{
  WorkflowResultFieldOne string
  WorkflowResultFieldTwo int
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
  if err != nil {
    return "", err
  }
  responseVar := YourWorkflowResponse {
    FieldOne: "super",
    FieldTwo: 1,
  }
  return responseVar, nil
}
```

A Workflow Definition written in Go can return both a custom value and an error.
However, it is not possible to receive both a custom value and an error in the calling process as is normal in Go.
The caller will receive either one or the other.
Returning a non-nil `error` from a Workflow indicates that an error was encountered during its execution and the Workflow Execution should be Terminated and any custom return values will be ignored by the system.

#### Logic requirements

<TabItem value="go">

Workflow Definition code cannot directly do the following:

- Iterate over maps using `range`, because with `range` the order of the map's iteration is randomized.
  Instead you can collect the keys of the map, sort them, and then iterate over the sorted keys to access the map.
  This technique provides deterministic results.
  You can also use a Side Effect or an Activity to process the map instead.
- Call an external API, conduct a file I/O operation, talk to another service, etc. (Use an Activity for these.)

Additionally the Temporal Go SDK offers APIs to handle equivalent Go constructs:

- `workflow.Now()` This is a replacement for `time.Now()`.
- `workflow.Sleep()` This is a replacement for `time.Sleep()`.
- `workflow.GetLogger()` This ensures that the provided logger does not duplicate logs during a replay.
- `workflow.Go()` This is a replacement for the `go` statement.
- `workflow.Channel` This is a replacement for the native `chan` type.
  Temporal provides support for both buffered and unbuffered channels.
- `workflow.Selector` This is a replacement for the `select` statement. Learn more on the [Go SDK Selectors](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go/selectors) page
- `workflow.Context` This is a replacement for `context.Context`. Learn more on the [Go SDK Context Propagation](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go/tracing) page.

### Develop Activities

One of the primary things that Workflows do, is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
Activities are normal function/method executions that can interact with the world.
For the Workflow to be able to execute the Activity we must define the [Activity Definition](/docs/concepts-guide/#activity-definition)

<Tabs

<TabItem value="go">

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity Definition is an exportable function or a `struct` method.

#### Function

```go
// basic function signature
func YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context) error {
  // ...
  return nil
}

// with parameters and return values
func SimpleActivity(ctx context.Context, value string) (string, error)
```

#### Struct method

```go
type YourActivityStruct struct {
  ActivityFieldOne string
  ActivityFieldTwo int
}

func(a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context) error {
  // ...
}

func(a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinitionTwo(ctx context.Context) error {
  // ...
}
```

An "Activity struct" can have more than one method, with each method acting as a separate Activity Type.
Activities written as struct methods can use shared struct variables such as:

- an application level DB pool
- client connection to another service
- reusable utilities
- any other expensive resources you only want to initialize once per process

Because this is such a common need, the rest of this guide shows Activities written as `struct` methods.

#### Activity parameters in Go

The first parameter of an Activity Definition is `context.Context`.
This parameter is optional for an Activity Definition, though it is recommended especially if the Activity is expected to use other Go SDK APIs.

An Activity Definition can support as many other custom parameters as needed.
However, all parameters must be serializable (parameters can’t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers), and it is recommended to pass a single struct that can be updated later.

```go
type YourActivityParam struct {
  ActivityParamFieldOne string
  ActivityParamFieldTwo int
}

type YourActivityStruct struct {
  // ...
}

func (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) error {
  // ...
}
```

There is no explicit limit to the amount of parameter data that can be passed to an Activity.
However, all parameters are recorded in the Workflow Execution History and a large Workflow Execution History can adversely impact the performance of your Workflow Execution.

#### Activity return values in Go

A Go-based Activity Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination (same as a Workflow Definition).
You may wish to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values, just keep in mind they must all be serializable.

```go
type YourActivityResult struct{
  ActivityResultFieldOne string
  ActivityResultFieldTwo int
}

func (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (YourActivityResult, error) {
  // ...
  result := YourActivityResult {
    ActivityResultFieldOne: a.ActivityFieldOne,
    ActivityResultFieldTwo: a.ActivityFieldTwo,
  }
  return result, nil
}
```

#### Other notes for developing Activities

All native features of the Go programming language can be used within an Activity and there are no other limitations to Activity Definition logic:

- **Performance**: Keep in mind that all parameters and return values are recorded in the [Workflow Execution Event History](/docs/concepts-guide/#event-history).
  A large Workflow Execution Event History can adversely impact the performance of your Workflow Executions, because the entire Event History is transferred to Worker Processes with every [Workflow Task](/docs/concepts-guide/#workflow-task).
- **Idiomatic usage**: You are free to use:
  - your own loggers and metrics controllers
  - the standard Go concurrency constructs
  - make calls to other services across a network

<TabItem value="java">

An [Activity Definition](/docs/concepts-guide/#activities) is a combination of the Temporal Java SDK [Activity](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/0.19.0/io/temporal/activity/Activity.html) Class implementing a specially annotated interface.

#### Activity interface

Activity interface is a Java interface and is annotated with the `@ActivityInterface` annotation.

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

Each method defined in the Actvity interface defines a separate Activity method.
You can annotate each method in the Activity interface with the `@ActivityMethod` annotation, but this is completely optional. The following example uses the `@ActivityMethod` annotation for the method defined in the previous example.

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {
    @ActivityMethod()
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

The Activity Type defaults to method name, with the first letter of the method name capitalized. In the previous example, the Activity Type defaults to `ComposeGreeting`.

To overwrite this default naming and assign a custom Activity Type, use the `@ActivityMethod` annotation with the `name` parameter. In the following example, the Activity Type is set to "greet".

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {
    @ActivityMethod(name = "greet")
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

You can also define a prefix for all of your Activity Types using the `namePrefix` parameter with the `@ActivityInterface` annotation. The following example shows a `namePrefix` parameter applied to the `@ActivityInterface`, and two Activity methods, of which one is defined using the `@ActivityMethod` annotation.

```java
@ActivityInterface(namePrefix = "A_")
Public interface MyActivity {
    String doSomething(String input);

  @ActivityMethod(name = "abc")
  String doSomethingElse();
}
```

In this example, the Activity type for the first method is set to "A_DoSomething". The Activity type for the method annotated with `@ActivityMethod` is set to "A_abc".

#### Activity implementation

An Activity implementation is a Java class that implements an Activity annotaged interface.
Example:

```java
  public class MultiLanguageGreeting implements GreetingsActivities {
    private final TranslationService translationService;

    public MultiLanguageGreeting(TranslationService translationService) {
      this.translationService = translationService;
    }

    @Override
    public String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language) {
      return translationService.translate(greeting, language);
    }
  }
```

#### Dynamic Activities

Use `DynamicActivity` to implement any number of Activity types dynamically.
When an Activity implementation that extends `DynamicActivity` is registered, it is called for any Activity type invocation that doesn't have an explicitly registered handler.

`DynamicActivity` can be useful for integrations with existing libraries.
For example, it can be used to call some external HTTP API with each function exposed as a different Activity type.

The Dynamic Activity interface is implemented with the `execute` method. This method takes in `EncodedValues` that are inputs to the Activity Execution, as shown in the following example.

```java
 // Dynamic Activity implementation
  public static class DynamicGreetingActivityImpl implements DynamicActivity {
    @Override
    public Object execute(EncodedValues args) {
      String activityType = Activity.getExecutionContext().getInfo().getActivityType();
      return activityType
          + ": "
          + args.get(0, String.class)
          + " "
          + args.get(1, String.class)
          + " from: "
          + args.get(2, String.class);
    }
  }
```

Use `Activity.getExecutionContext()` to get information about the Activity type that should be implemented dynamically.

You can only register one instance that implements `DynamicActivity` with a Worker.

### Spawn Activity Execution

Calls to spawn [Activity Executions](/docs/concepts-guide/#activity-execution) are written within a Workflow Definition.
The call to spawn an Activity Execution generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/docs/concepts-guide/#commands#scheduleactivitytask) Command.
This results in the set of three [Activity Task](/docs/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task) related Events ([ActivityTaskScheduled](/docs/references/events/#activitytaskscheduled), [ActivityTaskStarted](/docs/references/events/#activitytaskstarted), and ActivityTask[Closed])in your Workflow Execution Event History.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

To spawn an [Activity Execution](/docs/concepts-guide/#activity-execution), use the [`ExecuteActivity()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/workflow#ExecuteActivity) API call inside your Workflow Definition.
The API is available from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/workflow) package.

The `ExecuteActivity()` API call requires an instance of `workflow.Context`, the Activity function name, and any variables to be passed to the Activity Execution.

```go
import (
  // ...

  "go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
  yourActivityParam := YourActivityParam{
    // ...
  }
  var activities *YourActivityStruct
  future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, activities.YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
  // ...
}

func (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) error {
  // ...
}
```

The Activity function name can be provided as a variable object (no quotations) or as a string.

```go
// ...
  future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, "YourActivityDefinition", yourActivityParam)
// ...
```

The benefit of passing the actual function object is that the framework can validate the parameters against the Activity Definition.

The `ExecuteActivity` call returns a Future, which can be used to get the result of the Activity Execution.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

Activities are remote procedure calls that must be invoked from within a Workflow using `ActivityStub`.
Activities are not executable on their own. You cannot start an Activity Execution by itself.

Note that before an Activity Execution is invoked:

- Activity options (either [`setStartToCloseTimeout`](/docs/concepts-guide/#start-to-close-timeout) or [`ScheduleToCloseTimeout`](/docs/concepts-guide/#schedule-to-close-timeout) are required) must be set for the Activity.
  See [Activity Options](/docs/java/how-to-set-activityoptions-in-java).
- The Activity must be registered with a Worker.
  See [Worker Program](/docs/java/how-to-develop-a-worker-program-in-java)
- Activity code must be thread-safe.

Activities should only be instantiated using stubs from within a Workflow.
An `ActivityStub` returns a client-side stub that implements an Activity interface.
You can invoke Activities using `Workflow.newActivityStub`(type-safe) or `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub` (untyped).

Calling a method on the Activity interface schedules the Activity invocation with the Temporal service, and generates an [`ActivityTaskScheduled` Event](/docs/concepts-guide/#events#activitytaskscheduled).

Activities can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously.

#### Invoking Activities Synchronously

In the following example, we use the type-safe `Workflow.newActivityStub` within the "FileProcessingWorkflow" Workflow implementation to create a client-side stub of the `FileProcessingActivities` class. We also define `ActivityOptions` and set `setStartToCloseTimeout` option to one hour.

```java
public class FileProcessingWorkflowImpl implements FileProcessingWorkflow {

    private final FileProcessingActivities activities;

    public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {
        this.activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(
                FileProcessingActivities.class,
                ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofHours(1))
                        .build());
    }

    @Override
    public void processFile(Arguments args) {
        String localName = null;
        String processedName = null;
        try {
            localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());
            processedName = activities.processFile(localName);
            activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);
        } finally {
            if (localName != null) {
                activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);
            }
            if (processedName != null) {
                activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);
            }
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

A Workflow can have multiple Activity stubs. Each Activity stub can have its own `ActivityOptions` defined.
The following example shows a Workflow implementation with two typed Activity stubs.

```java
public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {
    ActivityOptions options1 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
             .setTaskQueue("taskQueue1")
             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(10))
             .build();
    this.store1 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options1);

    ActivityOptions options2 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
             .setTaskQueue("taskQueue2")
             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
             .build();
    this.store2 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options2);
}
```

To invoke Activities inside Workflows without referencing the interface it implements, use an untyped Activity stub `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub`.
This is useful when the Activity type is not known at compile time, or to invoke Activities implemented in different programming languages.

```java
   // Workflow code
    ActivityOptions activityOptions =
        ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3))
        .setTaskQueue("simple-queue-node")
        .build();

    ActivityStub activity = Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub(activityOptions);
    activity.execute("ComposeGreeting", String.class, "Hello World" , "Spanish");
```

#### Invoking Activities Asynchronously

Sometimes Workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.
The Temporal Java SDK provides the `Async` class which includes static methods used to invoke any Activity asynchronously.
The calls return a result of type `Promise` which is similar to the Java `Future` and `CompletionStage`.
When invoking Activities, use `Async.function` for Activities that return a result, and `Async.procedure` for Activities that return void.

In the following asynchronous Activity invocation, the method reference is passed to `Async.function` followed by Activity arguments.

```java
Promise<String> localNamePromise = Async.function(activities::download, sourceBucket, sourceFile);
```

The following example shows how to call two Activity methods, "download" and "upload", in parallel on multiple files.

```java
  public void processFile(Arguments args) {
    List<Promise<String>> localNamePromises = new ArrayList<>();
    List<String> processedNames = null;
    try {
      // Download all files in parallel.
      for (String sourceFilename : args.getSourceFilenames()) {
        Promise<String> localName =
            Async.function(activities::download, args.getSourceBucketName(), sourceFilename);
        localNamePromises.add(localName);
      }
      List<String> localNames = new ArrayList<>();
      for (Promise<String> localName : localNamePromises) {
        localNames.add(localName.get());
      }
      processedNames = activities.processFiles(localNames);

      // Upload all results in parallel.
      List<Promise<Void>> uploadedList = new ArrayList<>();
      for (String processedName : processedNames) {
        Promise<Void> uploaded =
            Async.procedure(
                activities::upload,
                args.getTargetBucketName(),
                args.getTargetFilename(),
                processedName);
        uploadedList.add(uploaded);
      }
      // Wait for all uploads to complete.
      Promise.allOf(uploadedList).get();
    } finally {
      for (Promise<String> localNamePromise : localNamePromises) {
        // Skip files that haven't completed downloading.
        if (localNamePromise.isCompleted()) {
          activities.deleteLocalFile(localNamePromise.get());
        }
      }
      if (processedNames != null) {
        for (String processedName : processedNames) {
          activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

#### Activity Execution Context

`ActivityExecutionContext` is a context object passed to each Activity implementation by default.
You can access it in your Activity implementations via `Activity.getExecutionContext()`.

It provides getters to access information about the Workflow that invoked the Activity.
Note that the Activity context information is stored in a thread-local variable.
Therefore, calls to `getExecutionContext()` succeed only within the thread that invoked the Activity function.

Following is an example of using the `ActivityExecutionContext`:

```java
public class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {

  @Override
  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {

    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();
    ActivityInfo info = ctx.getInfo();

    log.info("namespace=" +  info.getActivityNamespace());
    log.info("workflowId=" + info.getWorkflowId());
    log.info("runId=" + info.getRunId());
    log.info("activityId=" + info.getActivityId());
    log.info("activityTimeout=" + info.getStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds());

    return downloadFileFromS3(bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);
  }
    ...
}
```

### Get Activity results

The call to spawn an [Activity Execution](/docs/concepts-guide/#activity-execution) generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/docs/concepts-guide/#commands/#scheduleactivitytask) Command and provides the Workflow with an Awaitable.
Workflow Executions can either block progress until the result is available via the Awaitable or continue progressing, making use of the result when it becomes available.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

The `ExecuteActivity` API call returns an instance of [`workflow.Future`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Futures) which has the following two methods:

- `Get()`: Takes an instance of the `workflow.Context`, that was passed to the Activity Execution, and a pointer as parameters.
  The variable associated with the pointer is populated with the Activity Execution result.
  This call blocks until the result is available.
- `IsReady()`: Returns `true` when the result of the Activity Execution is ready.

Call the `Get()` method on the instance of `workflow.Future` to get the result of the Activity Execution.
The type of the result parameter must match the type of the return value declared by the Activity function.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
  future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
  var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
  if err := future.Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult); err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

Use the `IsReady()` method first to make sure the `Get()` call doesn't cause the Workflow Execution to wait on the result.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
  future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
  // ...
  if(future.IsReady()) {
    var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
    if err := future.Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult); err != nil {
      // ...
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

It is idiomatic to invoke multiple Activity Executions from within a Workflow.
Therefore it is also idiomatic to either block on the results of any of the Activity Executions or continue on to execute additional logic, checking for the Activity Execution results at a later time.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

To get the results of an asynchronously invoked Activity method, use the `Promise` `get` method to block until the Activity method result is available.

Sometimes an Activity Execution lifecycle goes beyond a synchronous method invocation.
For example, a request can be put in a queue and later a reply comes and is picked up by a different Worker process.
The whole request-reply interaction can be modeled as a single Activity.

To indicate that an Activity should not be completed upon its method return, call `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()` from the original Activity thread.

Then later, when replies come, complete the Activity using the `ActivityCompletionClient`.
To correlate Activity invocation with completion use either a `TaskToken` or Workflow and Activity IDs.

Following is an example of using `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()`:

```java
public class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {

  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {

    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();

    // Used to correlate reply
    byte[] taskToken = ctx.getInfo().getTaskToken();

    asyncDownloadFileFromS3(taskToken, bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);
    ctx.doNotCompleteOnReturn();

    // Return value is ignored when doNotCompleteOnReturn was called.
    return "ignored";
  }
  ...
}
```

When the download is complete, the download service potentially can complete the Activity, or fail it from a different process, for example:

```java
  public <R> void completeActivity(byte[] taskToken, R result) {
    completionClient.complete(taskToken, result);
  }

  public void failActivity(byte[] taskToken, Exception failure) {
    completionClient.completeExceptionally(taskToken, failure);
  }
```

### Create Temporal Clients

A Temporal Client is needed to [create Worker Entities](#run-worker-processes) and to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.
Communication with the Temporal Cluster includes but is not limited to starting Workflow Executions, sending Signals to Workflow Executions, sending Queries to Workflow Executions, getting the result of a Workflow Execution.

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside Workflow code.
However, it is acceptable and common to utilize a Temporal Client, to communicate with a Temporal Cluster, inside an Activity.

### Run Worker Processes

The [Worker Process](/docs/concepts-guide/#worker-process) is where Workflow Functions and Activity Functions are executed.
Each [Worker Entity](/docs/concepts-guide/#worker-entity) in the Worker Process must register the exact Workflow Types and Activity Types it may execute.
Each Worker Entity must also associate itself with exactly one [Task Queue](/docs/concepts-guide/#task-queues).
Each Worker Entity polling the same Task Queue must be registered with the same Workflow Types and Activity Types.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

Create an instance of [`Worker`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#Worker) by calling [`worker.New()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#New), available via the `go.temporal.io/sdk/worker` package, and pass it the following parameters:

1. An instance of the Temporal Go SDK `Client`.
2. The name of the Task Queue that it will poll.
3. An instance of [`worker.Options`](/docs/go/how-to-set-workeroptions-in-go), which can be empty.

Then, register the Workflow Types and the Activity Types that the Worker will be capable of executing.

Lastly, call either the `Start()` or the `Run()` method on the instance of the Worker.
Run accepts an interrupt channel as a parameter, so that the Worker can be stopped in the terminal.
Otherwise the `Stop()` method must be called to stop the Worker.

```go
package main

import (
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
)

func main() {
	c, err := client.NewClient(client.Options{})
	if err != nil {
		// ...
	}
	defer c.Close()
	w := worker.New(c, "your-task-queue", worker.Options{})
	w.RegisterWorkflow(YourWorkflowDefinition)
	w.RegisterActivity(YourActivityDefinition)
	err = w.Run(worker.InterruptCh())
	if err != nil
		// ...
	}
  // ...
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
}

func YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (YourActivityResponse, error) {
  // ...
}
```

Start the Worker Process by running `go run <filename>.go`.

:::tip

If you have [`gow`](https://github.com/mitranim/gow) installed, the Worker Process automatically "reloads" when you update the file:

```bash
go install github.com/mitranim/gow@latest
gow run worker/main.go # automatically reload when file changed
```

:::

The `RegisterWorkflow()` and `RegisterActivity()` calls essentially create an in-memory mapping between the Workflow Types and their implementations, inside the Worker process.

Notice that the Task Queue name is the same as the name provided when the [Workflow Execution is spawned](#spawn-workflow-execution).

The name of the Task Queue that is provided to the Worker must be the same Task Queue name that is provided with the invocation of the Workflow Execution.

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it will fail that Task.
However, the failure of the Task will not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

#### Registering Activity `structs`

Per [Activity Definition](#develop-activities) best practices, you may have an Activity struct that has multiple methods and fields. When you use `RegisterActivity()` for an Activity struct, that Worker has access to all exported methods.

#### Registering multiple Types

To register multiple Activity Types and/or Workflow Types with the Worker Entity, just make multiple Activity registration calls, but make sure each Type name is unique:

```go
w.registerActivity(ActivityA)
w.registerActivity(ActivityB)
w.registerActivity(ActivityC)
w.registerWorkflow(WorkflowA)
w.registerWorkflow(WorkflowB)
w.registerWorkflow(WorkflowC)
```

#### Registering with options

Options can be applied when the Type is registered.

For example, an Activity Type name can be customized to something other than the function name using the [`RegisterActivityWithOptions`](/docs/go/how-to-set-registeractivityoptions-in-go) call.

And a Workflow Type name can be customized to something other than the function name using the [`RegisterWorkflowWithOptions`](/docs/go/how-to-set-registerworkflowoptions-in-go) call.

### Spawn Workflow Execution

[Workflow Execution](/docs/concepts-guide/#workflow-execution) semantics rely on several parameters - that is, to start a Workflow Execution you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type, language specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

To spawn a [Workflow Execution](/docs/concepts-guide/#workflow-execution), use the `ExecuteWorkflow()` method on the Go SDK [`Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/client#Client), which is available via [`NewClient()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/client#NewClient) in the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/client) package.

The Go SDK Temporal Client should never be used inside a [Workflow Definition](/docs/concepts-guide/#workflow-definition).
To spawn a Workflow Execution from within another Workflow, use the [`ExecuteChildWorkflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ExecuteChildWorkflow) API.
For more information, see [How to spawn a Child Workflow Execution in Go](/docs/go/how-to-spawn-a-child-workflow-execution-in-go).

The `ExecuteWorkflow()` API call requires an instance of [`context.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context), an instance of [`StartWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/client#StartWorkflowOptions), a Workflow Type name, and all variables to be passed to the Workflow Execution.
The `ExecuteWorkflow()` call returns a Future, which can be used to get the result of the Workflow Execution.

```go
package main

import (
  // ...

  "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)

func main() {
  temporalClient, err := client.NewClient(client.Options{})
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  defer temporalClient.Close()
  // ...
  workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
    ID: "Your-Custom-Workflow-Id",
    TaskQueue: "your-task-queue",
  }
  workflowRun, err := temporalClient.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
}
```

Start the preceding process by running `go run <filename>.go`.

Notice that the Task Queue name is the same as the name provided when a Worker Entity is created.

The only field, of the `StartWorkflowOptions` instance, that requires a value is the `TaskQueue`.
A Task Queue name is also provided to the Worker that is registered to execute that particular Workflow Type.
The Task Queue name must be the same for both.

We recommend supplying your own custom Workflow Id that can be used to get the result of the Workflow Execution asynchronously at another point in time.
A custom Workflow Id is intended to correspond to a business-level identifier.

By default, the Workflow Type name is the same as the function name.
If the invocation process has access to the function directly, then the Workflow Type name parameter can be passed as if the function name were a variable, without quotations.

If the invocation process does not have direct access to the statically defined Workflow Definition, for example, if the Workflow Definition is in an un-importable package, or it is written in a completely different language, then the Workflow Type can be provided as a `string`.

```go
workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, "YourWorkflowDefinition", param)
```

In Go, the name of the Workflow Type can be customized when the Workflow Definition is registered with a Worker Entity.

### Get Workflow results

TODO

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

The `ExecuteWorkflow` call returns an instance of [`WorkflowRun`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#WorkflowRun), which is the `workflowRun` variable in the following line.

```go
  workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, app.YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

The instance of `WorkflowRun` has the following three methods:

- `GetWorkflowID()`: Returns the Workflow Id of the invoked Workflow Execution.
- `GetRunID()`: Always returns the Run Id of the initial Run (See [Continue As New](#)) in the series of Runs that make up the full Workflow Execution.
- `Get`: Takes a pointer as a parameter and populates the associated variable with the Workflow Execution result.

To wait on the result of Workflow Execution in the same process that invoked it, call `Get()` on the instance of `WorkflowRun` that is returned by the `ExecuteWorkflow()` call.

```go
  workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  var result YourWorkflowResponse
  err = workflowRun.Get(context.Background(), &result)
  if err != nil {
      // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

However, the result of a Workflow Execution can be obtained from a completely different process.
All that is needed is the [Workflow Id](#).
(A [Run Id](#) is optional if more than one closed Workflow Execution has the same Workflow Id.)
The result of the Workflow Execution is available for as long as the Workflow Execution Event History remains in the system.

<!-- TODO (See [How long do Workflow Execution Histories persist](#)). -->

Call the `GetWorkflow()` method on the an instance of the Go SDK Client and pass it the Workflow Id used to spawn the Workflow Execution.
Then call the `Get()` method on the instance of `WorkflowRun` that is returned, passing it a pointer to populate the result.

```go
  // ...
  workflowID := "Your-Custom-Workflow-Id"
  workflowRun := c.GetWorkflow(context.Background, workflowID)

  var result YourWorkflowResponse
  err = workflowRun.Get(context.Background(), &result)
  if err != nil {
      // ...
  }
  // ...
```

#### Get last completion result

In the case of a [Temporal Cron Job](/docs/concepts-guide/#cron-jobs), you might need to get the result of the previous Workflow Run and use it in the current Workflow Run.

To do this, use the [`HasLastCompletionResult`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#HasLastCompletionResult) and [`GetLastCompletionResult`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLastCompletionResult) APIs, available from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow) package, directly in your Workflow code.

```go
type CronResult struct {
  Count int
}

func YourCronWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context) (CronResult, error) {
  count := 1

  if workflow.HasLastCompletionResult(ctx) {
    var lastResult CronResult
    if err := workflow.GetLastCompletionResult(ctx, &lastResult); err == nil {
      count = count + lastResult.Count
    }
  }

  newResult := CronResult {
    Count: count,
  }
  return newResult, nil
}
```

This will work even if one of the cron Workflow Runs fails.
The next Workflow Run gets the result of the last successfully Completed Workflow Run.

## Features

This section covers many of the features that are available to use in your [Temporal Application](/docs/concepts-guide/#temporal-application).

### Signals

First define your Signal type.
Then add a Signal handler to your Workflow Definition.

Signals can be sent to Workflow Executions via the Temporal Client or from within a Workflow.

Signal-With-Start can be used to start a Workflow Execution (if not already running) and pass it the Signal at the same time.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

To use Signals in Go, first define your Signal type and then add a Signal handler to your Workflow Definition.
Signals can then be sent via the Temporal Client or from within a Workflow.

#### Define Signal type

**How to define a Signal Type in Go**

Structs can be used as Signal data, as long as the struct is [serializable via the Data Converter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#CompositeDataConverter.ToPayload).
The `Receive()` method on the Data Converter decodes the data into the Struct within the Workflow ([Handling Signals](#handling-signals)).
Only public fields are serializable.

```go
MySignal struct {
	Message string // serializable
	message string // not serializable
}
```

#### Handle Signal

**How to handle a Signal in Go**

Use the `GetSignalChannel()` API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package to get the Signal Channel.
Get a new [`Selector`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Selector) and pass it the Signal Channel and a callback function to handle the payload.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {
  // ...
  var signal MySignal
  signalChan := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, "your-signal-name")
  selector := workflow.NewSelector(ctx)
  selector.AddReceive(signalChan, func(channel workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {
      channel.Receive(ctx, &signal)
      // ...
  })
  selector.Select(ctx)
  if len(signal.Message) > 0 && signal.Message != "SOME_VALUE" {
      return errors.New("signal")
  }
  // ...
}
```

In the example above, the Workflow code uses `workflow.GetSignalChannel` to open a `workflow.Channel` for the Signal type (identified by the Signal name).
We then use a [`workflow.Selector`](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go/selectors) and the `AddReceive()` to wait on a Signal from this channel.
The `more` bool in the callback function indicates that channel is not closed and more deliveries are possible.

#### Send Signal from Temporal Client

**How to send a Signal from a Temporal Client in Go**

Use the `SignalWorkflow()` method on an instance of the [Go SDK Temporal Client](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client) to send a [Signal](/docs/concepts-guide/#signals) to a [Workflow Execution](/docs/concepts-guide/#workflow-execution).

Pass in both the [Workflow Id](/docs/concepts-guide/#workflow-id) and [Run Id](/docs/concepts-guide/#run-id) to uniquely identify the Workflow Execution.
If just the Workflow Id is supplied (provide an empty string as the Run Id param), then the Workflow Execution that is Running will receive the Signal.

```go
// ...
signal := MySignal {
  Message: "Some important data",
}
err = temporalClient.SignalWorkflow(context.Background(), "your-workflow-id", runID, "your-signal-name", signal)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("Error sending the Signal", err)
	return
}
// ...
```

Possible errors:

- `serviceerror.NotFound`
- `serviceerror.Internal`
- `serviceerror.Unavailable`

#### Send Signal from within a Workflow

**How to send a Signal from within a Workflow in Go**

A Signal can be sent from within a Workflow to a different Workflow Execution using the [`SignalExternalWorkflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#SignalExternalWorkflow) API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package.

```go
// ...
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {
  //...
  signal := MySignal {
    Message: "Some important data",
  }
  err :=  workflow.SignalExternalWorkflow(ctx, "some-workflow-id", "", "your-signal-name", signalData).Get(ctx, nil)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
// ...
}
```

#### Signal-With-Start

**How to send a Signal-With-Start in Go**

Use the `SignalWithStartWorkflow()` API on the Go SDK Temporal Client to start a Workflow Execution (if not already running) and pass it the Signal at the same time.

Because the Workflow Execution may not exist, this API does not take a Run ID as a parameter

```go
// ...
signal := MySignal {
  Message: "Some important data",
}
err = temporalClient.SignalWithStartWorkflow(context.Background(), "your-workflow-id", "your-signal-name", signal)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("Error sending the Signal", err)
	return
}
```
