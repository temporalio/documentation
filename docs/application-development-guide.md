This guide is meant to provide a comprehensive overview of the structures, primitives, and features used in Temporal Application development.

:::info WORK IN PROGRESS

This guide is a work in progress.
Some sections may be incomplete or missing for some languages.
Information may change at any time.

:::

This guide is meant to be a comprehensive resource for developing a [Temporal Application](/docs/temporal/#temporal-application).

It is broken down into five large sections:

- [Foundations](#foundations): The minimum things required to build and run a simple Workflow with a single Activity.
- [Features](#features): All of the general features available to a Temporal Application.
- [Observability](#observability): Features and tools available that give you insight into you application.
- [Testing](#testing): How to test your Temporal Application code.
- [Scaling](#scaling): Things to consider and look for when scaling a Temporal Application to millions or billions of Workflow Executions.

## Foundations

This section covers the minimum set of concepts and implementation details needed to build and run a simple [Temporal Application](/docs/temporal/#temporal-application) – that is, all the relevant steps to start a Workflow Execution that executes an Activity.

### Run a dev Cluster

Whenever we are developing Temporal Applications, we want to have a [Temporal Cluster](/docs/clusters/#) up and running.
We can interact with a Cluster through [Temporal Client](/docs/temporal/#temporal-client) APIs and [tctl](/docs/tctl) commands.

There are four ways to quickly install and run a Temporal Cluster:

- [Docker](#docker): Using Docker Compose makes it easy to develop your Temporal Application locally.
- [Render](#render): Our [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) experience has been translated to Render's Blueprint format for an alternative cloud connection.
- [Helm charts](#helm-charts): Deploying a Cluster to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an easy way to test the system and develop Temporal Applications.
- [Gitpod](#gitpod): One-click deployments are available for Go and TypeScript.

**We do not recommend using any of these methods in a [full (production) environment](/docs/server/production-deployment).**

#### Helm charts

Use [Temporal Helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts) to deploy the Temporal Server to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.

Deploying the Temporal Cluster with Helm is not recommended for a production environment, but it is a great way to test the system while developing Workflows.

#### Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose and Temporal Cluster Docker images to quickly install and run a Temporal Cluster locally while developing Workflows.

You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed.

Then clone the [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) repository and run `docker-compose up` from the root of that repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
cd  docker-compose
docker-compose up
```

When the Temporal Cluster is running, the Temporal Web UI becomes available in your browser: [localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088/)

The preceding steps start and run a Temporal Cluster using a default configuration.
To try other configurations (different dependencies and databases), or to try a custom Docker image, follow the [temporalio/docker-compose README](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose/blob/main/README.md).

#### Render

[temporal-render-simple](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-render-simple) translates our docker-compose to Render by using the [Auto-Setup Docker image](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup).
We do not recommend using this technique for production because all four Temporal internal services (Frontend, Matching, History, and Worker) are run in one process, but the benefit is one-click deployments.

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-render-simple)

#### Gitpod

You can run a Temporal Cluster and develop Temporal Applications in your browser using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

One-click deployments are available for the [temporalio/samples-go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go) repo and the [temporalio/samples-typescript](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript) repo.

A one-click deployment starts a Temporal Cluster using a Temporal Cluster Docker image, starts a Worker Process, and starts one of the application's sample Workflows.

It can take up to a full minute for the one-click deployments to get fully up and running.
When it is running, you can customize the application samples.

### Add your SDK

Add a [Temporal SDK](/docs/temporal/#temporal-sdk) to your project.
Both TypeScript and Javascript can be used with the TypeScript SDK.

### Develop Workflows

Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a [Workflow Definition](/docs/workflows/#workflow-definitions).

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, a [Workflow Definition](/docs/workflows/#workflow-definitions) is an exportable function.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context) error {
  // ...
  return nil
}
```

In Go, by default, the Workflow Type name is the same as the function name.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

Content is not available

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

In PHP, a Workflow is a class method. Classes must implement interfaces that are annotated with `#[YourWorkflowInterface]`. The method that is the Workflow must be annotated with `#[WorkflowMethod]`.

```php
use Temporal\Workflow\YourWorkflowInterface;
use Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowMethod;

#[YourWorkflowInterface]
interface FileProcessingWorkflow
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function processFile(Argument $args);

}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

A Workflow Function has two parts:

- The function name is the [Workflow Type](/docs/workflows/#workflow-types/).
- The function implementation is the [Workflow Definition](/docs/workflows/#workflow-definitions).

Workflow Functions are bundled with their dependencies and registered by name in a Worker. A Workflow Function becomes a [Workflow Execution](/docs/workflows/#workflow-executions) when it's started from a Workflow Client.

Workflow Functions are _just functions_, which can store state, and orchestrate Activity Functions.
The following code snippet uses `proxyActivities` to schedule a `greet` Activity in the system to say hello.

A Workflow Function can have multiple parameters; however, we recommend using a single object parameter.

```typescript
type ExampleArgs = {
  name: string;
};

export async function example(args: ExampleArgs): Promise<{greeting: string}> {
  const greeting = await greet(args.name);
  return {greeting};
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Workflow parameters

Temporal Workflows may have any number of custom parameters.
However, it is strongly recommended that objects are used as parameters, so that the object's individual fields may be altered without breaking the signature of the Workflow.
All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

The first parameter of a Go-based Workflow Definition must be of the [`workflow.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Context) type, as it is used by the Temporal Go SDK to pass around Workflow Execution context, and virtually all the Go SDK APIs that are callable from the Workflow require it.
It is acquired from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow) package.

```go
import (
    "go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param string) error {
  // ...
}
```

The `workflow.Context` entity operates similarly to the standard `context.Context` entity provided by Go.
The only difference between `workflow.Context` and `context.Context` is that the `Done()` function, provided by `workflow.Context`, returns `workflow.Channel` instead of the standard Go `chan`.

The second parameter, `string`, is a custom parameter that is passed to the Workflow when it is invoked.
A Workflow Definition may support multiple custom parameters, or none.
These parameters can be regular type variables or safe pointers.
However, the best practice is to pass a single parameter that is of a `struct` type so there can be some backward compatibility if new parameters are added.

```go
type YourWorkflowParam struct {
  WorkflowParamFieldOne string
  WorkflowParamFieldTwo int
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {
  // ...
}
```

All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable, regardless of whether pointers or regular type values are used.
Parameters can’t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers.

<TabItem value="typescript">

A Task Queue is a dynamic queue in Temporal polled by one or more Workers.

When scheduling a Workflow, a `taskQueue` must be specified.

```typescript
import {Connection, WorkflowClient} from "@temporalio/client";
const connection = new Connection();
const client = new WorkflowClient();
const result = await client.execute(myWorkflow, {
  taskQueue: "your-task-queue", // required
  workflowId: "your-workflow-id", // required
});
```

When creating a Worker, you must pass the `taskQueue` option to the `Worker.create()` function.

```typescript
const worker = await Worker.create({
  activities, // imported elsewhere
  taskQueue: "your-task-queue",
});
```

Optionally, in Workflow code, when calling an Activity, you can specify the Task Queue by passing the `taskQueue` option to `proxyActivities()`, `startChild`, or `executeChild`. If you do not specify a `taskQueue`, then the TypeScript SDK places Activity and Child Workflow Tasks in the same Task Queue as the Workflow Task Queue.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Workflow return values

Workflow return values must also be serializable.
Returning results, returning errors, or throwing exceptions is fairly idiomatic in each language that is supported.
However, Temporal APIs that must be used to get the result of a Workflow Execution will only ever receive one of either the result or the error.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

A Go-based Workflow Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination.
Again, the best practice here is to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values.

```go
type YourWorkflowResponse struct{
  WorkflowResultFieldOne string
  WorkflowResultFieldTwo int
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
  if err != nil {
    return "", err
  }
  responseVar := YourWorkflowResponse {
    FieldOne: "super",
    FieldTwo: 1,
  }
  return responseVar, nil
}
```

A Workflow Definition written in Go can return both a custom value and an error.
However, it is not possible to receive both a custom value and an error in the calling process as is normal in Go.
The caller will receive either one or the other.
Returning a non-nil `error` from a Workflow indicates that an error was encountered during its execution and the Workflow Execution should be Terminated and any custom return values will be ignored by the system.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

Content is not available

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

A Workflow method returns a Generator.
To properly typecast the Workflow's return value in the client code, use the `#[ReturnType()]` annotation.

```php
#[YourWorkflowInterface]
interface FileProcessingWorkflow {

    #[WorkflowMethod]
    #[ReturnType("string")]
    public function processFile(Argument $args);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

Query Handlers can return values inside a Workflow in TypeScript.

You make a Query with `handle.query(query, ...args)`. A Query needs a return value, but can also take arguments.

```typescript
import * as wf from "@temporalio/workflow";

function useState<T = any>(name: string, initialValue: T) {
  const query = wf.defineQuery<T>(name);
  let state: T = initialValue;
  return {
    query,
    get value() {
      return state;
    },
    set value(newVal: T) {
      state = newVal;
    },
  };
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Workflow logic requirements

Workflow logic is constrained by [deterministic execution requirements](/docs/workflows/#workflow-definitions/#deterministic-constraints).
Therefor each language is limited to the use of certain idiomatic techniques.
However, each Temporal SDK provides a set of APIs that can be used inside your Workflow to interact with external (to the Workflow) application code.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

In Go, Workflow Definition code cannot directly do the following:

- Iterate over maps using `range`, because with `range` the order of the map's iteration is randomized.
  Instead you can collect the keys of the map, sort them, and then iterate over the sorted keys to access the map.
  This technique provides deterministic results.
  You can also use a Side Effect or an Activity to process the map instead.
- Call an external API, conduct a file I/O operation, talk to another service, etc. (Use an Activity for these.)

The Temporal Go SDK has APIs to handle equivalent Go constructs:

- `workflow.Now()` This is a replacement for `time.Now()`.
- `workflow.Sleep()` This is a replacement for `time.Sleep()`.
- `workflow.GetLogger()` This ensures that the provided logger does not duplicate logs during a replay.
- `workflow.Go()` This is a replacement for the `go` statement.
- `workflow.Channel` This is a replacement for the native `chan` type.
  Temporal provides support for both buffered and unbuffered channels.
- `workflow.Selector` This is a replacement for the `select` statement. Learn more on the [Go SDK Selectors](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go/selectors) page
- `workflow.Context` This is a replacement for `context.Context`. Learn more on the [Go SDK Context Propagation](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go/tracing) page.

### Develop Activities

One of the primary things that Workflows do, is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
Activities are normal function/method executions that can interact with the world.
For the Workflow to be able to execute the Activity we must define the [Activity Definition](/docs/activities/#activity-definition)

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity Definition is an exportable function or a `struct` method.

**Function**

```go
// basic function signature
func YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context) error {
  // ...
  return nil
}

// with parameters and return values
func SimpleActivity(ctx context.Context, value string) (string, error)
```

**Struct method**

```go
type YourActivityStruct struct {
  ActivityFieldOne string
  ActivityFieldTwo int
}

func(a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context) error {
  // ...
}

func(a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinitionTwo(ctx context.Context) error {
  // ...
}
```

An "Activity struct" can have more than one method, with each method acting as a separate Activity Type.
Activities written as struct methods can use shared struct variables such as:

- an application level DB pool
- client connection to another service
- reusable utilities
- any other expensive resources you only want to initialize once per process

Because this is such a common need, the rest of this guide shows Activities written as `struct` methods.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

Content is not available

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

Activities are defined as methods of a plain PHP interface annotated with `#[YourActivityInterface]`.
(You can also use PHP 8 attributes in PHP 7.)

Following is an example of an interface that defines four Activities:

```php
#[YourActivityInterface]
// Defining an interface for the activities.
interface FileProcessingActivities
{
    public function upload(string $bucketName, string $localName, string $targetName): void;

    #[ActivityMethod("transcode_file")]
    public function download(string $bucketName, string $remoteName): void;

    public function processFile(): string;

    public function deleteLocalFile(string $fileName): void;
}
```

#### How to customize an Activity type

We recommend to use a single value type argument for Activity methods.
In this way, adding new arguments as fields to the value type is a backward-compatible change.

An optional `#[ActivityMethod]` annotation can be used to override a default Activity name.

You can define your own prefix for all Activity names by adding the `prefix` option to the `YourActivityInterface` annotation.
(The default prefix is empty.)

```php
#[YourActivityInterface("file_activities.")]
interface FileProcessingActivities
{
    public function upload(string $bucketName, string $localName, string $targetName);

    #[ActivityMethod("transcode_file")]
    public function download(string $bucketName, string $remoteName);

    public function processFile(): string;

    public function deleteLocalFile(string $fileName);
}
```

The `#[YourActivityInterface("file_activities.")]` is an annotation that tells the PHP SDK to generate a class to implement the `FileProcessingActivities` interface. The functions define Activites that are used in the Workflow.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

- Activities execute in the standard Node.js environment.
- Activities cannot be in the same file as Workflows and must be separately registered.
- Activities may be retried repeatedly, so you may need to use idempotency keys for critical side effects.

Activities are _just functions_. The following is an Activity that accepts a string parameter and returns a string.

```typescript
export async function greet(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Activity parameters

All Activity parameters must be serializable.

There is no explicit limit to the amount of parameter data that can be passed to an Activity, but keep in mind that all parameters and return values are recorded in a [Workflow Execution Event History](/docs/workflows/#event-history).
A large Workflow Execution Event History can adversely impact the performance of your Workflow Executions, because the entire Event History is transferred to Worker Processes with every [Workflow Task](/docs/tasks/#workflow-task).

The first parameter of an Activity Definition is `context.Context`.
This parameter is optional for an Activity Definition, though it is recommended especially if the Activity is expected to use other Go SDK APIs.

An Activity Definition can support as many other custom parameters as needed.
However, all parameters must be serializable (parameters can’t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers), and it is recommended to pass a single struct that can be updated later.

```go
type YourActivityParam struct {
  ActivityParamFieldOne string
  ActivityParamFieldTwo int
}

type YourActivityStruct struct {
  // ...
}

func (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) error {

#### Activity return values

All Activity results must be serializable.

There is no explicit limit to the amount of data that can be returned by an Activity, but keep in mind that all return values are recorded in a [Workflow Execution Event History](/docs/workflows/#event-history)

<Tabs

<TabItem value="go">

A Go-based Activity Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination (same as a Workflow Definition).
You may wish to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values, just keep in mind they must all be serializable.

```go
type YourActivityResult struct{
  ActivityResultFieldOne string
  ActivityResultFieldTwo int
}

func (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (YourActivityResult, error) {
  // ...
  result := YourActivityResult {

    ActivityResultFieldTwo: a.ActivityFieldTwo,

To define Return Types in your Activity, retrieve an Activity from an _Activity Handle_ before you can call it. Import the types of the activities defined in `./activities`.

```typescript
import type * as activities from "./activities";
const {greet} = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: "1 minute",
});

/** A workflow that simply calls an activity */
export async function example(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return await greet(name);
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Start Activity Execution

Calls to spawn [Activity Executions](/docs/activities/#activity-execution) are written within a Workflow Definition.
The call to spawn an Activity Execution generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/docs/workflows/#commands#scheduleactivitytask) Command.
This results in the set of three [Activity Task](/docs/tasks/#activity-task) related Events ([ActivityTaskScheduled](/docs/references/events/#activitytaskscheduled), [ActivityTaskStarted](/docs/references/events/#activitytaskstarted), and ActivityTask[Closed])in your Workflow Execution Event History.

A single instance of the Activities implementation is shared across multiple simultaneous Activity invocations.
Therefore, the Activity implementation code must be _stateless_.

The values passed to Activities through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the Execution history.
The entire Execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow Workers when a Workflow state needs to recover.
A large Execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.

Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data you transfer through Activity invocation parameters or Return Values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.

To spawn an [Activity Execution](/docs/activities/#activity-execution), use the [`ExecuteActivity()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/workflow#ExecuteActivity) API call inside your Workflow Definition.
The API is available from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/workflow) package.

The `ExecuteActivity()` API call requires an instance of `workflow.Context`, the Activity function name, and any variables to be passed to the Activity Execution.

```go
import (
  // ...

  "go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
  yourActivityParam := YourActivityParam{
    // ...
  }
  var activities *YourActivityStruct
  future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, activities.YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
  // ...
}

func (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) error {
  // ...
}
```

The Activity function name can be provided as a variable object (no quotations) or as a string.

```go
// ...
  future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, "YourActivityDefinition", yourActivityParam)
// ...
```

The benefit of passing the actual function object is that the framework can validate the parameters against the Activity Definition.

The `ExecuteActivity` call returns a Future, which can be used to get the result of the Activity Execution.

Activity implementation is an implementation of an Activity interface.
The following code example, uses a constructor that takes an Amazon S3 client and a local directory, and uploads a file to the S3 bucket.
Then, the code uses a function to dowload a file from the S3 bucket passing a bucket name, remote name, and local name as arguments.
Finally, it uses a function that takes a local file name as an argument and returns a string.

```php
// An implementation of an Activity interface.
class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {

    private S3Client $s3Client;

    private string $localDirectory;

    public function __construct(S3Client $s3Client, string $localDirectory) {
        $this->s3Client = $s3Client;
        $this->localDirectory = $localDirectory;
    }

    // Uploading a file to S3.
    public function upload(string $bucketName, string $localName, string $targetName): void

To spawn an Activity Execution, you must retrieve the _Activity handle_ in your Workflow.

```typescript
import {proxyActivities} from "@temporalio/workflow";
// Only import the activity types
import type * as activities from "./activities";

const {greet} = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: "1 minute",
});

/** A workflow that calls an activity */
export async function example(name: string): Promise<string> {

### Get Activity results

The call to spawn an [Activity Execution](/docs/activities/#activity-execution) generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/docs/workflows/#commands/#scheduleactivitytask) Command and provides the Workflow with an Awaitable.
Workflow Executions can either block progress until the result is available via the Awaitable or continue progressing, making use of the result when it becomes available.

defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"

<TabItem value="go">

The `ExecuteActivity` API call returns an instance of [`workflow.Future`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Futures) which has the following two methods:

- `Get()`: Takes an instance of the `workflow.Context`, that was passed to the Activity Execution, and a pointer as parameters.
  The variable associated with the pointer is populated with the Activity Execution result.
  This call blocks until the result is available.
- `IsReady()`: Returns `true` when the result of the Activity Execution is ready.

Call the `Get()` method on the instance of `workflow.Future` to get the result of the Activity Execution.
The type of the result parameter must match the type of the return value declared by the Activity function.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
  future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
  var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
  if err := future.Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult); err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

Use the `IsReady()` method first to make sure the `Get()` call doesn't cause the Workflow Execution to wait on the result.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
  future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
  // ...
  if(future.IsReady()) {
    var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
    if err := future.Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult); err != nil {
      // ...
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

It is idiomatic to invoke multiple Activity Executions from within a Workflow.
Therefore it is also idiomatic to either block on the results of any of the Activity Executions or continue on to execute additional logic, checking for the Activity Execution results at a later time.

`Workflow::newActivityStub`returns a client-side stub an implements an Activity interface. The client-side stub can be used within the Workflow code. It takes the Activity's type and`ActivityOptions` as arguments.

Calling (via `yield`) a method on this interface invokes an Activity that implements this method.
An Activity invocation synchronously blocks until the Activity completes, fails, or times out.
Even if Activity execution takes a few months, the Workflow code still sees it as a single synchronous invocation.
It doesn't matter what happens to the processes that host the Workflow.
The business logic code just sees a single method call.

```php
class GreetingWorkflow implements GreetingWorkflowInterface
{
    private $greetingActivity;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
            GreetingActivityInterface::class,
            ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 seconds'))
        );
    }

    public function greet(string $name): \Generator
    {
        // This is a blocking call that returns only after the activity has completed.
        return yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hello', $name);
    }
}
```

If different Activities need different options, like timeouts or a task queue, multiple client-side stubs can be created with different options.

```php
$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 seconds'))
);

$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 minutes'))
);

Since Activities are referenced by their string name, you can reference them dynamically to get the result of an Activity Execution.

```typescript
export async function DynamicWorkflow(activityName, ...args) {
  const acts = proxyActivities(/* activityOptions */);

  // these are equivalent
  await acts.activity1();
  await acts["activity1"]();

  let result = await acts[activityName](...args);
  return result;
}
```

The `proxyActivities()` returns an object that calls the Activities in the function. `acts[activityName]()` references the Activity using the Activity name, then it returns the results.

### Create Temporal Clients

A Temporal Client is needed to [create Worker Entities](#run-worker-processes) and to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.
Communication with the Temporal Cluster includes but is not limited to starting Workflow Executions, sending Signals to Workflow Executions, sending Queries to Workflow Executions, getting the result of a Workflow Execution.

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside Workflow code.
However, it is acceptable and common to utilize a Temporal Client, to communicate with a Temporal Cluster, inside an Activity.

Use a new `WorflowClient()` with the requisite gRPC `Connection` to create a new Client.

```typescript
import {Connection, WorkflowClient} from "@temporalio/client";
const connection = new Connection(); // to configure for production
const client = new WorkflowClient(connection.service);
```

Declaring the `WorflowClient()` creates a new connection to the Temporal service.

If you ommit the connection and just call the `new WorkflowClient()`, you will create a default connection that works locally. However, configure your connection and Namespace when [deploying to production](/docs/typescript/security/#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls).

The following example, creates a Client, connects to an account, and declares your Namespace.

```typescript
import {Connection, WorkflowClient} from "@temporalio/client";

const connection = new Connection({
  address: "<Namespace ID>.tmprl.cloud", // defaults port to 7233 if not specified
  tls: {
    // set to true if TLS without mTLS
    // See docs for other TLS options
    clientCertPair: {
      crt: clientCert,
      key: clientKey,
    },
  },
});
await connection.untilReady();
const client = new WorkflowClient(connection.service, {
  namespace: "your.namespace",
});
```

[The Hello World mTLS sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-node/tree/main/hello-world-mtls/) demonstrates sample code used to connect to a Temporal Cloud account.
When signing up to Temporal Cloud you should receive a Namespace, a Server address and a client certificate and key. Use the following environment variables to set up the sample:

- **TEMPORAL_ADDRESS**: looks like `foo.bar.tmprl.cloud` (NOT web.foo.bar.tmprl.cloud)
- **TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE**: looks like `foo.bar`
- **TEMPORAL_CLIENT_CERT_PATH**: `/tls/ca.pem` (file contents start with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----)
- **TEMPORAL_CLIENT_KEY_PATH**: `/tls/ca.key` (file contents start with -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----)

You can leave the remaining vars, like `TEMPORAL_SERVER_NAME_OVERRIDE` and `TEMPORAL_SERVER_ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH` blank.
There is another var, `TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE`, which the example defaults to `'hello-world-mtls'` but you can customize as needed.
Example environment settings

```typescript
export function getEnv(): Env {
  return {
    address: "web.<Namespace ID>.tmprl.cloud", // NOT web.foo.bar.tmprl.cloud
    namespace: "your.namespace", // as assigned
    clientCertPath: "foobar.pem", // in project root
    clientKeyPath: "foobar.key", // in project root
    taskQueue: process.env.TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE || "hello-world-mtls", // just to ensure task queue is same on client and worker, totally optional
    // // not usually needed
    // serverNameOverride: process.env.TEMPORAL_SERVER_NAME_OVERRIDE,
    // serverRootCACertificatePath: process.env.TEMPORAL_SERVER_ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH,
  };
}
```

If you have misconfigured your connection somehow, you will get an opaque `[TransportError: transport error]` error. Read through your settings carefully and contact Temporal if you are sure you have checked everything.

Note the difference between the gRPC and Temporal Web endpoints:

- The gRPC endpoint has a DNS address of `<Namespace ID>.tmprl.cloud`, for example: `accounting-production.f45a2.tmprl.cloud`.
- The Temporal Web endpoint is `web.<Namespace ID>.tmprl.cloud`, for example: `https://web.accounting-production.f45a2.tmprl.cloud`.

If you are using mTLS, it is completely up to you how to get the `clientCert` and `clientKey` pair into your code, whether it is reading from file system, secrets manager, or both. Just keep in mind that they are whitespace sensitive, and some environment variable systems have been known to cause frustration because they modify whitespace.

The following code example works for local development and for certifications hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket.

```typescript
let serverRootCACertificate: Buffer | undefined;
let clientCertificate: Buffer | undefined;
let clientKey: Buffer | undefined;
if (certificateS3Bucket) {
  const s3 = new S3client({region: certificateS3BucketRegion});
  serverRootCACertificate = await s3.getObject({
    bucket: certificateS3Bucket,
    key: serverRootCACertificatePath,
  });
  clientCertificate = await s3.getObject({
    bucket: certificateS3Bucket,
    key: clientCertPath,
  });
  clientKey = await s3.getObject({
    bucket: certificateS3Bucket,
    key: clientKeyPath,
  });
} else {
  serverRootCACertificate = fs.readFileSync(serverRootCACertificatePath);
  clientCertificate = fs.readFileSync(clientCertPath);
  clientKey = fs.readFileSync(clientKeyPath);
}
```

### Run Worker Processes

The [Worker Process](/docs/workers/#worker-process) is where Workflow Functions and Activity Functions are executed.
Each [Worker Entity](/docs/workers/#worker-entity) in the Worker Process must register the exact Workflow Types and Activity Types it may execute.
Each Worker Entity must also associate itself with exactly one [Task Queue](/docs/tasks/#task-queues).
Each Worker Entity polling the same Task Queue must be registered with the same Workflow Types and Activity Types.

<TabItem value="go">

Create an instance of [`Worker`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#Worker) by calling [`worker.New()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#New), available via the `go.temporal.io/sdk/worker` package, and pass it the following parameters:

1. An instance of the Temporal Go SDK `Client`.
2. The name of the Task Queue that it will poll.
3. An instance of [`worker.Options`](/docs/go/how-to-set-workeroptions-in-go), which can be empty.

Then, register the Workflow Types and the Activity Types that the Worker will be capable of executing.

Lastly, call either the `Start()` or the `Run()` method on the instance of the Worker.
Run accepts an interrupt channel as a parameter, so that the Worker can be stopped in the terminal.
Otherwise the `Stop()` method must be called to stop the Worker.

```go
package main

import (
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
)

func main() {
	c, err := client.NewClient(client.Options{})
	if err != nil {
		// ...
	}
	defer c.Close()
	w := worker.New(c, "your-task-queue", worker.Options{})
	w.RegisterWorkflow(YourWorkflowDefinition)
	w.RegisterActivity(YourActivityDefinition)
	err = w.Run(worker.InterruptCh())
	if err != nil
		// ...
	}
  // ...
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
}

func YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (YourActivityResponse, error) {
  // ...
}
```

Start the Worker Process by running `go run <filename>.go`.

:::tip

If you have [`gow`](https://github.com/mitranim/gow) installed, the Worker Process automatically "reloads" when you update the file:

```bash
go install github.com/mitranim/gow@latest
gow run worker/main.go # automatically reload when file changed
```

:::

The `RegisterWorkflow()` and `RegisterActivity()` calls essentially create an in-memory mapping between the Workflow Types and their implementations, inside the Worker process.

Notice that the Task Queue name is the same as the name provided when the [Workflow Execution is spawned](#start-workflow-execution).

The name of the Task Queue that is provided to the Worker must be the same Task Queue name that is provided with the invocation of the Workflow Execution.

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it will fail that Task.
However, the failure of the Task will not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

#### Registering Activity `structs`

Per [Activity Definition](#develop-activities) best practices, you may have an Activity struct that has multiple methods and fields. When you use `RegisterActivity()` for an Activity struct, that Worker has access to all exported methods.

#### Registering multiple Types

To register multiple Activity Types and/or Workflow Types with the Worker Entity, just make multiple Activity registration calls, but make sure each Type name is unique:

```go
w.registerActivity(ActivityA)
w.registerActivity(ActivityB)
w.registerActivity(ActivityC)
w.registerWorkflow(WorkflowA)
w.registerWorkflow(WorkflowB)
w.registerWorkflow(WorkflowC)
```

#### Registering with options

Options can be applied when the Type is registered.

For example, an Activity Type name can be customized to something other than the function name using the [`RegisterActivityWithOptions`](/docs/go/how-to-set-registeractivityoptions-in-go) call.

And a Workflow Type name can be customized to something other than the function name using the [`RegisterWorkflowWithOptions`](/docs/go/how-to-set-registerworkflowoptions-in-go) call.

First create a Worker with `Worker.create()` (which establishes the initial gRPC connection), then call `worker.run()` on it (to start polling the Task Queue).

Below is an example of starting a Worker that polls the Task Queue named `tutorial`.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-hello-worker {"enable_source_link": false}-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

`taskQueue` is the only required option, but you will also use `workflowsPath` and `activities` to register Workflows and Activities with the Worker.

A full example for Workers looks like this:

```typescript
import {Worker, NativeConnection} from "@temporalio/worker";
import * as activities from "./activities";

async function run() {
  const connection = await NativeConnection.create({
    address: "foo.bar.tmprl.cloud", // defaults port to 7233 if not specified
    tls: {
      // set to true if TLS without mTLS
      // See docs for other TLS options
      clientCertPair: {
        crt: clientCert,
        key: clientKey,
      },
    },
  });

  const worker = await Worker.create({
    connection,
    namespace: "foo.bar", // as explained in Namespaces section
    // ...
  });
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

See below for more Worker options.

#### Workflow and Activity registration

Workers bundle Workflow code and `node_modules` using Webpack v5 and execute them inside V8 isolates.
Activities are directly required and run by Workers in the Node.js environment.

Workers are very flexible – you can host any or all of your Workflows and Activities on a Worker, and you can host multiple Workers in a single machine.

There are three main things the Worker needs:

- `taskQueue`: the Task Queue to poll. This is the only required argument.
- `activities`: Optional. Imported and supplied directly to the Worker. Not the path.
- Workflow bundle:
- Either specify a `workflowsPath` to your `workflows.ts` file to pass to Webpack, e.g., `require.resolve('./workflows')`. Workflows will be bundled with their dependencies, which you can fine-tune with `nodeModulesPaths`.
- Or pass a prebuilt bundle to `workflowBundle` instead if you prefer to handle the bundling yourself.

#### Additional Worker Options

This is a selected subset of options you are likely to use. Even more advanced options, particularly for performance tuning, are available in [the API reference](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions).

| Options            | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nodeModulesPaths` | Array of paths of Workflow dependencies to pass to Webpack. Defaults to the first encountered `node_modules` directory when scanning the filesystem starting with `workflowsPath`. |
| `dataConverter`    | Encodes and decodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Server. Supports `undefined`, `UintBArray`, and JSON.                                                                     |
| `sinks`            | Allows injection of Workflow Sinks (Advanced feature: see [Logging docs](/docs/typescript/logging))                                                                                |
| `interceptors`     | A mapping of interceptor type to a list of factories or module paths (Advanced feature: see [Interceptors](/docs/typescript/interceptors))                                         |

### Start Workflow Execution

[Workflow Execution](/docs/workflows/#workflow-executions) semantics rely on several parameters - that is, to start a Workflow Execution you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type, language specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

In the examples below, all Workflow Executions are started using a Temporal Client.
To spawn Workflow Executions from within other Workflow Executions, use either the [Child Workflow](#child-workflows) or External Workflow APIs.

See the [Customize Workflow Type](#customize-workflow-type) section to see how to customize the name of the Workflow Type.

A request to spawn a Workflow Execution causes the Temporal Cluster to create the first Event ([WorkflowExecutionStarted](/docs/workflows/#events#workflowexecutionstarted)) in the Workflow Execution Event History.
The Temporal Cluster then creates the first Workflow Task resulting the first [WorkflowTaskScheduled](/docs/workflows/#events/#workflowtaskscheduled) Event.

To spawn a [Workflow Execution](/docs/workflows/#workflow-executions), use the `ExecuteWorkflow()` method on the Go SDK [`Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/client#Client).

The `ExecuteWorkflow()` API call requires an instance of [`context.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context), an instance of [`StartWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/client#StartWorkflowOptions), a Workflow Type name, and all variables to be passed to the Workflow Execution.
The `ExecuteWorkflow()` call returns a Future, which can be used to get the result of the Workflow Execution.

```go
package main

import (
  // ...

  "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)

func main() {
  temporalClient, err := client.NewClient(client.Options{})
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  defer temporalClient.Close()
  // ...
  workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
    // ...
  }
  workflowRun, err := temporalClient.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
}
```

If the invocation process has access to the function directly, then the Workflow Type name parameter can be passed as if the function name were a variable, without quotations.

```go
workflowRun, err := temporalClient.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
```

If the invocation process does not have direct access to the statically defined Workflow Definition, for example, if the Workflow Definition is in an un-importable package, or it is written in a completely different language, then the Workflow Type can be provided as a `string`.

```go
workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, "YourWorkflowDefinition", param)
```

When you have a Workflow Client, you can schedule the start of a Workflow with `client.start()`, specifying `workflowId`, `taskQueue`, and `args` and returning a Workflow handle immediately after the Server acknowledges the receipt.

```typescript
const handle = await client.start(example, {
  workflowId: "your-workflow-id",
  taskQueue: "your-task-queue",
  args: ["argument01", "argument02", "argument03"], // this is typechecked against workflowFn's args
});
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
const result = await handle.result();
```

Calling `client.start()` and `client.execute()` send a command to Temporal Server to schedule a new Workflow Execution on the specified Task Queue. It does not actually start until a Worker that has a matching Workflow Type, polling that Task Queue, picks it up.

You can test this by executing a Workflow Client command without a matching Worker. Temporal Server records the command in Event History, but does not make progress with the Workflow Execution until a Worker starts polling with a matching Task Queue and Workflow Definition.

#### Set Task Queue

The only Workflow Option that must be set is the name of the [Task Queue](/docs/tasks/#task-queues).

For any code to execute, a Worker Process must be running that contains a Worker Entity that is polling the same Task Queue name.

Create an instance of [`StartWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.10.0/client#StartWorkflowOptions) from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/client` package, set the `TaskQueue` field, and pass the instance to the `ExecuteWorkflow` call.

- Type: `string`
- Default: None, this is a required field to be set by the developer

```go
workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
  // ...
  TaskQueue: "your-task-queue",

Workers bundle Workflow code and node modules using Webpack v5 and execute them inside V8 isolates. Activities are directly required and run by Workers in the Node.js environment.

Workers are very flexible – you can host any or all of your Workflows and Activities on a Worker, and you can host multiple Workers in a single machine.

There are three main things the Worker needs:

- `taskQueue`: the Task Queue to poll. This is the only required argument.

- `activities`: Optional. Imported and supplied directly to the Worker.

- Workflow bundle:
- Either specify a `workflowsPath` to your `workflows.ts` file to pass to Webpack, for example, `require.resolve('./workflows')`. Workflows will be bundled with their dependencies, which you can finetune with `nodeModulesPaths`.
- Or pass a prebuilt bundle to `workflowBundle` instead if you prefer to handle the bundling yourself.

```typescript
import {Worker} from "@temporalio/worker";
import * as activities from "./activities";

async function run() {
  // Step 1: Register Workflows and Activities with the Worker and connect to
  // the Temporal server.
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve("./workflows"),
    activities,
    taskQueue: "hello-world",
  });
  // Worker connects to localhost by default and uses console.error for logging.
  // Customize the Worker by passing more options to create():
  // https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker
  // If you need to configure server connection parameters, see docs:
  // https://docs.temporal.io/docs/typescript/security#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls

  // Step 2: Start accepting tasks on the `tutorial` queue
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

`taskQueue` is the only required option; however, use `workflowsPath` and `activities` to register Workflows and Activities with the Worker.

#### Set Workflow Id

While it is not required, providing your own [Workflow Id](/docs/workflows/#workflow-id) that maps to business process id or business entity id is highly recommended, such as an order id or a customer id.

<Tabs

- Type: `string`
- Default: System generated UUID

```go

You can set a Workflow Id in the Client of a Workflow.

```typescript
const handle = await client.start(example, {
  workflowId: "yourWorkflowId",
  taskQueue: "yourTaskQueue",
  args: ["your", "arg", "uments"],
});
```

This starts a new Client with the given Workflow Id, Task Queue name, and an argument.

```typescript
const handle = await client.start(example, {
  args: ["Temporal"], // type inference works! args: [name: string]
  taskQueue: "your-task-queue",
  // in practice, use a meaningful business id, eg customerId or transactionId
  workflowId: "your-workflow-id-",
});
```

Connect to a Client with `client.start()` and any arguments. Then specify your `taskQueue` and set your `workflowId` to a meaningful business identifier.

### Get Workflow results

TODO

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

The `ExecuteWorkflow` call returns an instance of [`WorkflowRun`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#WorkflowRun), which is the `workflowRun` variable in the following line.

```go
  workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, app.YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

The instance of `WorkflowRun` has the following three methods:

- `GetWorkflowID()`: Returns the Workflow Id of the invoked Workflow Execution.
- `GetRunID()`: Always returns the Run Id of the initial Run (See [Continue As New](#)) in the series of Runs that make up the full Workflow Execution.
- `Get`: Takes a pointer as a parameter and populates the associated variable with the Workflow Execution result.

To wait on the result of Workflow Execution in the same process that invoked it, call `Get()` on the instance of `WorkflowRun` that is returned by the `ExecuteWorkflow()` call.

```go
  workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  var result YourWorkflowResponse
  err = workflowRun.Get(context.Background(), &result)
  if err != nil {
      // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

However, the result of a Workflow Execution can be obtained from a completely different process.
All that is needed is the [Workflow Id](#).
(A [Run Id](#) is optional if more than one closed Workflow Execution has the same Workflow Id.)
The result of the Workflow Execution is available for as long as the Workflow Execution Event History remains in the system.

<!-- TODO (See [How long do Workflow Execution Histories persist](#)). -->

Call the `GetWorkflow()` method on the an instance of the Go SDK Client and pass it the Workflow Id used to spawn the Workflow Execution.
Then call the `Get()` method on the instance of `WorkflowRun` that is returned, passing it a pointer to populate the result.

```go
  // ...
  workflowID := "Your-Custom-Workflow-Id"
  workflowRun := c.GetWorkflow(context.Background, workflowID)

  var result YourWorkflowResponse
  err = workflowRun.Get(context.Background(), &result)
  if err != nil {
      // ...
  }
  // ...
```

#### Get last completion result

In the case of a [Temporal Cron Job](/docs/workflows/#cron-jobs), you might need to get the result of the previous Workflow Run and use it in the current Workflow Run.

To do this, use the [`HasLastCompletionResult`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#HasLastCompletionResult) and [`GetLastCompletionResult`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLastCompletionResult) APIs, available from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow) package, directly in your Workflow code.

```go
type CronResult struct {
  Count int
}

func YourCronWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context) (CronResult, error) {
  count := 1

  if workflow.HasLastCompletionResult(ctx) {
    var lastResult CronResult
    if err := workflow.GetLastCompletionResult(ctx, &lastResult); err == nil {
      count = count + lastResult.Count
    }
  }

  newResult := CronResult {
    Count: count,
  }
  return newResult, nil
}
```

This will work even if one of the cron Workflow Runs fails.
The next Workflow Run gets the result of the last successfully Completed Workflow Run.

To return the results of a Workflow Execution:

```typescript
return (
  "Completed " +
  wf.workflowInfo().workflowId +
  ", Total Charged: " +
  totalCharged
);
```

`totalCharged` is just a function declared in your code. For a full example, see [subscription-workflow-project-template-typescript/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/subscription-workflow-project-template-typescript/blob/main/src/workflows.ts).

A Workflow function may return a result. If it doesn’t (in which case the return type is `Promise<void>`), the result will be `undefined`.

If you started a Workflow with `handle.start()`, you can choose to wait for the result anytime with handle.result().

```typescript
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
const result = await handle.result();
```

Using a Workflow Handle isn't necessary with `client.execute()`.

Workflows that prematurely end will throw a `WorkflowFailedError` if you call `result()`.

If you call `result()` on a Workflow that prematurely ended for some reason, it throws a [`WorkflowFailedError` error](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.workflowfailederror/) that reflects the reason. For that reason, it is recommended to catch that error.

```typescript
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
try {
  const result = await handle.result();
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof WorkflowFailedError) {
    throw new Error("Temporal workflow failed: " + workflowId, {
      cause: err,
    });
  } else {
    throw new Error("error from Temporal workflow " + workflowId, {
      cause: err,
    });
  }
}
```

## Features

This section covers many of the features that are available to use in your [Temporal Application](/docs/temporal/#temporal-application).

### Signals

A [Signal](/docs/workflows/#signals) is a message that delivers data to a running Workflow Execution.

Signals are defined alongside your application code and handled in your Workflow Definition.
Signals can be sent to Workflow Executions from a Temporal Client or from within a Workflow.

#### Define Signal

A Signal type and its data must be serializable.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

Structs should be used to define Signals and carry data, as long as the struct is [serializable via the Data Converter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#CompositeDataConverter.ToPayload).
The `Receive()` method on the Data Converter decodes the data into the Struct within the Workflow.
Only public fields are serializable.

```go
MySignal struct {
	Message string // serializable
	message string // not serializable
}
```

#### Handle Signal

Workflows listen for Signals by the Signal's name.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

Use the `GetSignalChannel()` API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package to get the Signal Channel.
Get a new [`Selector`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Selector) and pass it the Signal Channel and a callback function to handle the payload.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {
  // ...
  var signal MySignal
  signalChan := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, "your-signal-name")
  selector := workflow.NewSelector(ctx)
  selector.AddReceive(signalChan, func(channel workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {
      channel.Receive(ctx, &signal)
      // ...
  })
  selector.Select(ctx)
  if len(signal.Message) > 0 && signal.Message != "SOME_VALUE" {
      return errors.New("signal")
  }
  // ...
}
```

In the example above, the Workflow code uses `workflow.GetSignalChannel` to open a `workflow.Channel` for the Signal type (identified by the Signal name).
We then use a [`workflow.Selector`](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go/selectors) and the `AddReceive()` to wait on a Signal from this channel.
The `more` bool in the callback function indicates that channel is not closed and more deliveries are possible.

#### Send Signal from Client

When a Signal is sent successfully from the Temporal Client, the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/docs/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.

<Tabs

Use the `SignalWorkflow()` method on an instance of the [Go SDK Temporal Client](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client) to send a [Signal](/docs/workflows/#signals) to a [Workflow Execution](/docs/workflows/#workflow-executions).

Pass in both the [Workflow Id](/docs/workflows/#workflow-id) and [Run Id](/docs/workflows/#run-id) to uniquely identify the Workflow Execution.
If only the Workflow Id is supplied (provide an empty string as the Run Id param), the Workflow Execution that is Running receives the Signal.

```go
// ...
signal := MySignal {
  Message: "Some important data",
}
err = temporalClient.SignalWorkflow(context.Background(), "your-workflow-id", runID, "your-signal-name", signal)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("Error sending the Signal", err)
	return
}
// ...
```

- `serviceerror.NotFound`
- `serviceerror.Internal`
- `serviceerror.Unavailable`

#### Send Signal from Workflow

Sending a Signal from within a Workflow is often referred to as sending an External Signal.

The [SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/docs/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated) Event appears in the Workflow Execution Event History of the Workflow that sent the Signal, and the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/docs/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.

<TabItem value="go">

A Signal can be sent from within a Workflow to a different Workflow Execution using the [`SignalExternalWorkflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#SignalExternalWorkflow) API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package.

```go
// ...
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {
  //...
  signal := MySignal {
    Message: "Some important data",
  }
  err :=  workflow.SignalExternalWorkflow(ctx, "some-workflow-id", "", "your-signal-name", signalData).Get(ctx, nil)
  if err != nil {

First, define your Signal that can be sent to the Workflow.

```typescript
const update = wf.defineSignal<number>("update");
```

Then create your Workflow. In this example, our Worklfow charges a user every month.

```typescript
async function SubscriptionWorkflow(id: string, amount: number) {
  wf.setHandler(update, (newAmt) => (amount = newAmt));
  while (true) {
    await charge(id, amount);
    await sleepTilNextMonth();
  }
}
```

Then send your Signal to the Workflow.

```typescript
await handle.signal(update, 300);
```

The following is the implemented code that sends a Signal from a Workflow.

```typescript
// Defining a signal that can be sent to the workflow.
const update = wf.defineSignal<number>("update");
// workflow
async function SubscriptionWorkflow(id: string, amount: number) {
  wf.setHandler(update, (newAmt) => (amount = newAmt));
  while (true) {
    await charge(id, amount);
    await sleepTilNextMonth();
  }
}

// from client
await handle.signal(update, 300);
```

Every month, a customer will be charged an amount specified by the update handler.
The update handler is a function that takes a number and returns a numer. That number is used to update the amount the customer is charge.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Send Signal-With-Start

Signal-With-Start can be used to start a Workflow Execution (if not already running) and pass it the Signal at the same time.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

Use the `SignalWithStartWorkflow()` API on the Go SDK Temporal Client to start a Workflow Execution (if not already running) and pass it the Signal at the same time.

Because the Workflow Execution might not exist, this API does not take a Run ID as a parameter

```go
// ...
signal := MySignal {
  Message: "Some important data",
}
err = temporalClient.SignalWithStartWorkflow(context.Background(), "your-workflow-id", "your-signal-name", signal)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("Error sending the Signal", err)
	return
}

### Queries

A [Query](/docs/workflows/#queries) is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.

#### Query name

A Query name (also called Query type) is simply a string name.

<Tabs

values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

Use the `QueryWorkflow()` API or the `QueryWorkflowWithOptions` API on the Temporal Client to send a Query to a Workflow Execution.

```go
// ...
response, err := temporalClient.QueryWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowID, runID, queryType)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
// ...
```

You can pass an arbitrary number of arguments to the `QueryWorkflow()` function.

```go
// ...
response, err := temporalClient.QueryWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowID, runID, queryType, "foo", "baz")
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
// ...
```

The `QueryWorkflowWithOptions()` API provides similar functionality, but with the ability to set additional configurations through [QueryWorkflowWithOptionsRequest](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#QueryWorkflowWithOptionsRequest).
When using this API, you will also receive a structured response of type [QueryWorkflowWithOptionsResponse](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#QueryWorkflowWithOptionsResponse).

```go
// ...
response, err := temporalClient.QueryWorkflowWithOptions(context.Background(), &client.QueryWorkflowWithOptionsRequest{
    WorkflowID: workflowID,
    RunID: runID,
    QueryType: queryType,
    Args: args,

#### Handle Query

Queries are handled by your Workflow.

Do not include any logic that causes [Command](/docs/workflows/#commands) generation within a Query handler (such as executing Activities). as this will lead to unexpected behavior.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

Use the `SetQueryHandler` API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package to set a Query Handler that listens for a Query by name.

The handler must be a function that returns two values:

1. A serializable result
2. An error

The handler function can receive any number of input parameters, but all input parameters must be serializable.
The following sample code sets up a Query Handler that handles the `current_state` Query type:

```go
func MyWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, input string) error {
  currentState := "started" // This could be any serializable struct.
  queryType := "current_state"
  err := workflow.SetQueryHandler(ctx, queryType, func() (string, error) {
    return currentState, nil
  })
  if err != nil {
    currentState = "failed to register query handler"
    return err
  }
  // Your normal Workflow code begins here, and you update the currentState as the code makes progress.
  currentState = "waiting timer"
  err = NewTimer(ctx, time.Hour).Get(ctx, nil)
  if err != nil {
    currentState = "timer failed"
    return err
  }
  currentState = "waiting activity"
  ctx = WithActivityOptions(ctx, myActivityOptions)
  err = ExecuteActivity(ctx, MyActivity, "my_input").Get(ctx, nil)
  if err != nil {
    currentState = "activity failed"
    return err
  }
  currentState = "done"
  return nil
}
```

For example, suppose your query handler function takes two parameters:

```go
err := workflow.SetQueryHandler(ctx, "current_state", func(prefix string, suffix string) (string, error) {
    return prefix + currentState + suffix, nil
})
```

### Timers

TODO

### Workflow timeouts & retries

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.
A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

#### Workflow Execution Timeout

Use the [Workflow Execution Timeout](/docs/workflows/#workflow-execution-timeout) to limit maximum time that a Workflow Execution can be executing (have an Open status) including retries and any usage of Continue As New.

Use a [Retry Policy](/docs/retry-policies/#) to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default and Retry Policies should only be used with Workflow Executions in certain situations.

Create an instance of a [`RetryPolicy`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal#RetryPolicy) from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal` package and provide it as the value to the `RetryPolicy` field of the instance of `StartWorkflowOptions`.

- Type: [`RetryPolicy`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal#RetryPolicy)
- Default: None

```go
retrypolicy := &temporal.RetryPolicy{

### Activity timeouts & retries

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.
A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

#### Schedule-To-Close Timeout

Use the [Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/docs/activities/#schedule-to-close-timeout) to limit the maximum duration of an [Activity Execution](/docs/activities/#activity-execution).

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

To set a [Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/docs/activities/#schedule-to-close-timeout), create an instance of `ActivityOptions` from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package, set the `ScheduleToCloseTimeout` field, and then use the `WithActivityOptions()` API to apply the options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

This or `ScheduleToStart` must be set.

- Type: `time.Duration`
- Default: ∞ (infinity - no limit)

```go
activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  ScheduleToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)

When you call `proxyActivities` in a Workflow Function, you can set a range of `ActivityOptions`.

Either `scheduleToCloseTimeout` or `scheduleToStartTimeout` must be set.

Type: time.Duration
Default: ∞ (infinity – no limit)

In this example, you can set the `scheduleToCloseTimeout` to 5 m.

```typescript
// Sample of typical options you can set
const {greet} = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  scheduleToCloseTimeout: "5m",
  retry: {
    // default retry policy if not specified

#### Start-To-Close Timeout

Use the [Start-To-Close Timeout](/docs/activities/#start-to-close-timeout) to limit the maximum duration of a single [Activity Task Execution](/docs/tasks/#activity-task-execution).

<Tabs

This or `ScheduleToClose` must be set.

- Type: `time.Duration`
- Default: Same as the `ScheduleToCloseTimeout`

```go

When you call `proxyActivities` in a Workflow Function, you can set a range of `ActivityOptions`.

A Schedule-To-Start limits the maximum time that an Activity Task can sit in a Task Queue. It is used to identify whether a Worker is down or for Task routing.

Either `scheduleToCloseTimeout` or `scheduleToStartTimeout` must be set.

Type: time.Duration
Default: ∞ (infinity – no limit)

In this example, you can set the `ScheduleToStartTimeout` to 60 seconds.

### Child Workflows

A [Child Workflow Execution](/docs/workflows/#child-workflows) is a Workflow Execution that is scheduled from within another Workflow using a Child Workflow API.

When using a Child Workflow API, Child Workflow related Events ([StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/docs/references/events#startchildworkflowexecutioninitiated), [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/docs/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted), [ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted](/docs/references/events#childworkflowexecutioncompleted), etc...) are logged in the Workflow Execution Event History.

Always block progress until the [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/docs/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted) Event is logged to the Event History to ensure the Child Workflow Execution has started.
After that, Child Workflow Executions may be abandoned using the default _Abandon_ [Parent Close Policy](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy) set in the Child Workflow Options.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

To spawn a [Child Workflow Execution](/docs/workflows/#child-workflows) in Go, use the [`ExecuteChildWorkflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ExecuteChildWorkflow) API, which is available from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package.

The `ExecuteChildWorkflow` call requires an instance of [`workflow.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Context), with an instance of [`workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ChildWorkflowOptions) applied to it, the Workflow Type, and any parameters that should be passed to the Child Workflow Execution.

`workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions` contain the same fields as `client.StartWorkflowOptions`.
Workflow Option fields automatically inherit their values from the Parent Workflow Options if they are not explicitly set.
If a custom `WorkflowID` is not set, one is generated when the Child Workflow Execution is spawned.
Use the [`WithChildOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#WithChildOptions) API to apply Child Workflow Options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

The `ExecuteChildWorkflow` call returns an instance of a [`ChildWorkflowFuture`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ChildWorkflowFuture).

Call the `.Get()` method on the instance of `ChildWorkflowFuture` to wait for the result.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ParentParams) (ParentResp, error) {

  childWorkflowOptions := workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions{}
  ctx = workflow.WithChildOptions(ctx, childWorkflowOptions)

  var result ChildResp
  err := workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow(ctx, YourOtherWorkflowDefinition, ChildParams{}).Get(ctx, &result)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
  return resp, nil
}

func YourOtherWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ChildParams) (ChildResp, error) {
  // ...
  return resp, nil
}
```

To asynchronously spawn a Child Workflow Execution, the Child Workflow must have an "Abandon" Parent Close Policy set in the Child Workflow Options.
Additionally, the Parent Workflow Execution must wait for the "ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted" event to appear in its event history before it completes.

If the Parent makes the `ExecuteChildWorkflow` call and then immediately completes, the Child Workflow Execution will not spawn.

To be sure that the Child Workflow Execution has started, first call the `GetChildWorkflowExecution` method on the instance of the `ChildWorkflowFuture`, which will return a different Future.
Then call the `Get()` method on that Future, which is what will wait until the Child Workflow Execution has spawned.

```go
import (
  // ...
  "go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1"
)

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ParentParams) (ParentResp, error) {

  childWorkflowOptions := workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions{
    ParentClosePolicy: enums.PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_ABANDON,
  }
  ctx = workflow.WithChildOptions(ctx, childWorkflowOptions)

  childWorkflowFuture := workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow(ctx, YourOtherWorkflowDefinition, ChildParams{})
  // Wait for the Child Workflow Execution to spawn
  var childWE workflow.Execution
  if err := childWorkflowFuture.GetChildWorkflowExecution().Get(ctx, &childWE); err != nil {
     return err
  }
  // ...
  return resp, nil
}

func YourOtherWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ChildParams) (ChildResp, error) {
  // ...
  return resp, nil
}

#### Parent Close Policy

A [Parent Close Policy](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-parent-close-policy) determines what happens to a Child Workflow Execution if its Parent changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, or Timed out).

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

In Go, a Parent Close Policy is set on the `ParentClosePolicy` field of an instance of [`workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ChildWorkflowOptions).
The possible values can be obtained from the [`go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1#ParentClosePolicy) package.

- `PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_ABANDON`
- `PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_TERMINATE`
- `PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_REQUEST_CANCEL`

The Child Workflow Options are then applied to the the instance of `workflow.Context` by using the `WithChildOptions` API, which is then passed to the `ExecuteChildWorkflow()` call.

- Type: [`ParentClosePolicy`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1#ParentClosePolicy)
- Default: `PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_ABANDON`

```go
import (

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ParentParams) (ParentResp, error) {
  // ...
  childWorkflowOptions := workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions{

    ParentClosePolicy: enums.PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_ABANDON,
  }
  ctx = workflow.WithChildOptions(ctx, childWorkflowOptions)
  childWorkflowFuture := workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow(ctx, YourOtherWorkflowDefinition, ChildParams{})

Some Activities are long-running.
To react to a crash quickly, use the Heartbeat mechanism, `Activity::heartbeat()`, which lets the Temporal Server know that the Activity is still alive.
This acts as a periodic checkpoint mechanism for the progress of an Activity.

You can piggyback `details` on an Activity Heartbeat.
If an Activity times out, the last value of `details` is included in the `TimeoutFailure` delivered to a Workflow.
Then the Workflow can pass the details to the next Activity invocation.
Additionally, you can access the details from within an Activity via `Activity::getHeartbeatDetails`.
When an Activity is retried after a failure `getHeartbeatDetails` enables you to get the value from the last successful Heartbeat.

```php
use Temporal\Activity;

class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities
{
    // ...
    public function download(
        string $bucketName,
        string $remoteName,
        string $localName
    ): void
    {
        $this->dowloader->downloadWithProgress(
            $bucketName,
            $remoteName,
            $localName,
            // on progress
            function ($progress) {
                Activity::heartbeat($progress);
            }

### Cron Jobs

A [Temporal Cron Job](/docs/workflows/#cron-jobs) is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.

A Cron Schedule is provided as an option when the call to spawn a Workflow Execution is made.

Set the `DefaultLogger` to one of the following: `'TRACE'` | `'DEBUG'` | `'INFO'` | `'WARN'` | `'ERROR'`.

The following is an example of setting the `DefaultLogger` to `'Debug'`.

```typescript
Runtime.install({
  logger: new DefaultLogger("DEBUG"),
  telemetryOptions: {
    logForwardingLevel: "DEBUG",
    tracingFilter: "temporal_sdk_core=DEBUG",
  },
});
```

The following code sets the `DefaultLogger` to `'Debug'` and creates a Worker that can execute Activities or Workflows.

```typescript
import {Worker, Runtime, DefaultLogger} from "@temporalio/worker";
import * as activities from "./activities";
async function main() {
  const argv = arg({
    "--debug": Boolean,
  });
  /* Setting the log level to DEBUG. */
  if (argv["--debug"]) {
    Runtime.install({
      logger: new DefaultLogger("DEBUG"),
      telemetryOptions: {
        logForwardingLevel: "DEBUG",
        tracingFilter: "temporal_sdk_core=DEBUG",
      },
    });
  }
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    activities,
    workflowsPath: require.resolve("./workflows"),
    taskQueue: "test",
  });
  await worker.run();
  console.log("Worker gracefully shutdown");
