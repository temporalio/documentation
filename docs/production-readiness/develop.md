## How to encrypt data using a custom Data Converter {#securing-your-data}

Temporal Server stores and persists the data handled in your Workflow Execution.
Encrypting this data ensures that any sensitive application data is secure when handled by the Temporal Server.

For example, if you have sensitive information passed in the following objects that are persisted in the Workflow Execution Event History, use encryption to secure it:

- Inputs and outputs/results in your [Workflow](/workflows#workflow-execution), [Activity](/activities#activity-execution), and [Child Workflow](/workflows#child-workflow)
- [Signal](/workflows#signal) inputs
- [Memo](/workflows#memo)
- Headers (verify if applicable to your SDK)
- [Query](/workflows#query) inputs and results
- Results of [Local Activities](/activities#local-activity) and [Side Effects](/workflows#side-effect)
- [Application errors and failures](/kb/failures)

  Failure messages and stack traces are not encoded as codec-capable Payloads by default; you must explicitly enable encoding these common attributes on failures. For more details, see [Failure Converter](/dataconversion#failure-converter).

Using encryption ensures that your sensitive data exists unencrypted only on the Client and the Worker Process that is executing the Workflows and Activities, on hosts that you control.

By default, your data is serialized to a [Payload](/dataconversion#payload) by a [Data Converter](/dataconversion#).
To encrypt your Payload, configure your custom encryption logic with a [Payload Codec](/dataconversion#payload-codec) and set it with a [custom Data Converter](/dataconversion#custom-data-converter).

A Payload Codec does byte-to-byte conversion to transform your Payload (for example, by implementing compression and/or encryption and decryption) and is an optional step that happens between the wire and the [Payload Converter](/dataconversion#payload-converter):

```bash
User code <--> Payload Converter <--> Payload Codec <--> Wire <--> Temporal Server
```

You can run your Payload Codec with a [Codec Server](/dataconversion#codec-server) and use the Codec Server endpoints in Web UI and tctl to decode your encrypted Payload locally.
For details on how to set up a Codec Server, see [Codec Server setup](#codec-server-setup).

However, if you plan to set up [remote data encoding](/dataconversion#remote-data-encoding) for your data, ensure that you consider all security implications of running encryption remotely before implementing it.

In codec implementations, we recommend running the function (such as compression or encryption) on the entire input Payload and putting the result in the data field of a new Payload with a different encoding metadata field.
Using this technique ensures that the input Payload's metadata is preserved.
When the encoded Payload is sent to be decoded, you can verify the metadata field before applying the decryption.
If your Payload is _not_ encoded, we recommend passing the unencoded data to the decode function instead of failing the conversion.

**Create a custom Payload Codec**

Create a custom [PayloadCodec](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#PayloadCodec) implementation and define your encryption/compression and decryption/decompression logic in the `Encode` and `Decode` functions.

The Payload Codec converts bytes to bytes.
It must be used in an instance of [CodecDataConverter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#CodecDataConverter) that wraps a Data Converter to do the [Payload](/dataconversion#payload) conversions, and applies the custom encoding and decoding in `PayloadCodec` to the converted Payloads.

The following example from the [Data Converter sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/main/codec-server/data_converter.go) shows how to create a custom `NewCodecDataConverter` that wraps an instance of a Data Converter with a custom `PayloadCodec`.

```go
// Create an instance of Data Converter with your codec.
var DataConverter = converter.NewCodecDataConverter(
	converter.GetDefaultDataConverter(),
	NewPayloadCodec(),
)
//...
// Create an instance of PaylodCodec.
func NewPayloadCodec() converter.PayloadCodec {
	return &Codec{}
}
```

Implement your encryption/compression logic in the `Encode` function and the decryption/decompression logic in the `Decode` function in your custom `PayloadCodec`, as shown in the following example.

```go
// Codec implements converter.PayloadEncoder for snappy compression.
type Codec struct{}

// Encode implements converter.PayloadCodec.Encode.
func (Codec) Encode(payloads []*commonpb.Payload) ([]*commonpb.Payload, error) {
	result := make([]*commonpb.Payload, len(payloads))
	for i, p := range payloads {
		// Marshal proto
		origBytes, err := p.Marshal()
		if err != nil {
			return payloads, err
		}
		// Compress
		b := snappy.Encode(nil, origBytes)
		result[i] = &commonpb.Payload{
			Metadata: map[string][]byte{converter.MetadataEncoding: []byte("binary/snappy")},
			Data:     b,
		}
	}

	return result, nil
}

// Decode implements converter.PayloadCodec.Decode.
func (Codec) Decode(payloads []*commonpb.Payload) ([]*commonpb.Payload, error) {
	result := make([]*commonpb.Payload, len(payloads))
	for i, p := range payloads {
		// Decode only if it's our encoding
		if string(p.Metadata[converter.MetadataEncoding]) != "binary/snappy" {
			result[i] = p
			continue
		}
		// Uncompress
		b, err := snappy.Decode(nil, p.Data)
		if err != nil {
			return payloads, err
		}
		// Unmarshal proto
		result[i] = &commonpb.Payload{}
		err = result[i].Unmarshal(b)
		if err != nil {
			return payloads, err
		}
	}

	return result, nil
}
```

**Set Data Converter to use custom Payload Codec**

Set your custom `PayloadCodec` with an instance of `DataConverter` in your `Dial` client options that you use to create the client.

The following example shows how to set your custom Data Converter from a package called `mycodecpackage`.

```go
//...
c, err := client.Dial(client.Options{
		// Set DataConverter here to ensure that Workflow inputs and results are
		// encoded as required.
		DataConverter: mycodecpackage.DataConverter,
	})
//...
```

For reference, see the following samples:

- [Encryption](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/encryption)

**Create a custom Payload Codec**

Create a custom implementation of [`PayloadCodec`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/payload/codec/PayloadCodec.html) and use it in [`CodecDataConverter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/CodecDataConverter.html) to set a custom Data Converter.

The Payload Codec does byte-to-byte conversion and must be set with a Data Converter.

Define custom encryption/compression logic in your `encode` method and decryption/decompression logic in your `decode` method.

The following example from the [Java encryption sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/main/core/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/encryptedpayloads/CryptCodec.java) shows how to implement encryption and decryption logic on your payloads in your `encode` and `decode` methods.

```java
class YourCustomPayloadCodec implements PayloadCodec {

  static final ByteString METADATA_ENCODING =
      ByteString.copyFrom("binary/encrypted", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

  private static final String CIPHER = "AES/GCM/NoPadding";

  // Define constants that you can add to your encoded Payload to create a new Payload.
  static final String METADATA_ENCRYPTION_CIPHER_KEY = "encryption-cipher";

  static final ByteString METADATA_ENCRYPTION_CIPHER =
      ByteString.copyFrom(CIPHER, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

  static final String METADATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID_KEY = "encryption-key-id";

  private static final Charset UTF_8 = StandardCharsets.UTF_8;

  // See the linked sample for details on the methods called here.
  @NotNull
  @Override
  public List<Payload> encode(@NotNull List<Payload> payloads) {
    return payloads.stream().map(this::encodePayload).collect(Collectors.toList());
  }

  @NotNull
  @Override
  public List<Payload> decode(@NotNull List<Payload> payloads) {
    return payloads.stream().map(this::decodePayload).collect(Collectors.toList());
  }

  private Payload encodePayload(Payload payload) {
    String keyId = getKeyId();
    SecretKey key = getKey(keyId);

    byte[] encryptedData;
    try {
      encryptedData = encrypt(payload.toByteArray(), key); // The encrypt method contains your custom encryption logic.
    } catch (Throwable e) {
      throw new DataConverterException(e);
    }
    // Apply metadata to the encoded Payload that you can verify in your decode method before decoding.
    // See the sample for details on the metadata values set.
    return Payload.newBuilder()
        .putMetadata(EncodingKeys.METADATA_ENCODING_KEY, METADATA_ENCODING)
        .putMetadata(METADATA_ENCRYPTION_CIPHER_KEY, METADATA_ENCRYPTION_CIPHER)
        .putMetadata(METADATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID_KEY, ByteString.copyFromUtf8(keyId))
        .setData(ByteString.copyFrom(encryptedData))
        .build();
  }

  private Payload decodePayload(Payload payload) {
    // Verify the incoming encoded Payload metadata before applying decryption.
    if (METADATA_ENCODING.equals(
        payload.getMetadataOrDefault(EncodingKeys.METADATA_ENCODING_KEY, null))) {
      String keyId;
      try {
        keyId = payload.getMetadataOrThrow(METADATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID_KEY).toString(UTF_8);
      } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new PayloadCodecException(e);
      }
      SecretKey key = getKey(keyId);
      byte[] plainData;
      Payload decryptedPayload;

      try {
        plainData = decrypt(payload.getData().toByteArray(), key); // The decrypt method contains your custom decryption logic.
        decryptedPayload = Payload.parseFrom(plainData);
        return decryptedPayload;
      } catch (Throwable e) {
        throw new PayloadCodecException(e);
      }
    } else {
      return payload;
    }
  }

  private String getKeyId() {
    // Currently there is no context available to vary which key is used.
    // Use a fixed key for all payloads.
    // This still supports key rotation as the key ID is recorded on payloads allowing
    // decryption to use a previous key.

    return "test-key-test-key-test-key-test!";
  }

  private SecretKey getKey(String keyId) {
    // Key must be fetched from KMS or other secure storage.
    // Hard coded here only for example purposes.
    return new SecretKeySpec(keyId.getBytes(UTF_8), "AES");
  }

  //...
}
```

**Set Data Converter to use custom Payload Codec**

Use `CodecDataConverter` with an instance of a Data Converter and the custom `PayloadCodec` in the `WorkflowClient` options that you use in your Worker process and to start your Workflow Executions.

For example, to set a custom `PayloadCodec` implementation with `DefaultDataConverter`, use the following code:

```java
WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
  // Client that can be used to start and signal Workflows
  WorkflowClient client =
      WorkflowClient.newInstance(
          service,
          WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder()
              .setDataConverter(
                  new CodecDataConverter(
                      DefaultDataConverter.newDefaultInstance(),
                      Collections.singletonList(new YourCustomPayloadCodec()))) // Sets the custom Payload Codec created in the previous example with an instance of the default Data Converter.
              .build());
```

For example implementations, see the following samples:

## Codec Server setup {#codec-server-setup}

Use a Codec Server to decode your encoded [payloads](/dataconversion#payload) and integrate it with the Temporal Web UI and CLI commands when debugging your Workflows.

A Codec Server is an HTTP or HTTPS Server that you create and host.
It must be configured to use a [Payload Codec](/dataconversion#payload-codec) with the required decode logic and encryption keys.
Temporal Cloud requires an HTTPS Codec Server.

The Codec Server is independent of the Temporal Server and decodes your encrypted payloads through endpoints.
When you set the codec endpoint in the Temporal Web UI, the Web UI uses the remote endpoint to send encoded payloads to the Codec Server and receive decoded payloads from the Codec Server.
See [API contract requirements](#api-contract-specifications).
Decoded payloads are then displayed in the Workflow Execution Event History on the Web UI.

Note that when you use a Codec Server, the decoded payloads are visible only to you on the Web UI; payloads on the Temporal Server (whether on Temporal Cloud or a self-hosted Temporal Cluster) remain encrypted.

Because you create, operate, and manage access to your Codec Server in your controlled environment, ensure that you consider the following:

- When you set your codec endpoint with your Web UI, expect your Codec Server to receive a large number of requests per Workflow Execution from the Web UI.
- Ensure that you secure access your Codec Server.
  For details, see [Authorization](#authorization).
- The Temporal Web UI only displays the decoded payloads received from your Codec Server in real-time; it does not store or send the data back to the Temporal Server (whether on Cloud or self-hosted Temporal Cluster).
- You might have latencies introduced in the Web UI when sending and receiving payloads to the Codec Server.

To create a Codec Server, you need the following components:

- A [Payload Codec](/dataconversion#payload-codec) with the requisite keys and logic to decode your encrypted payloads.
  You can use the Payload Codec that you applied with your Data Converter to encode your Payloads and configure it with your Codec Server.
  However, if you are writing your Codec Server in a different SDK from the one that applies the Data Converter, ensure that your logic and keys are correctly replicated.
- Key management infrastructure or plan for sharing your encryption keys between the Workers and your Codec Server.
- [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) configuration on the HTTP/HTTPS endpoints in your Codec Server for sending and receiving requests from the Temporal Web UI.
- Optional: Secure access through VPN and access control.
  For details, see [Authorization](#authorization).

For examples on how to create your Codec Server, see following Codec Server implementation samples:

- [Go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server)
- [Java](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/tree/master/temporal-remote-data-encoder)
- [Python](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/blob/main/encryption/codec_server.py)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/encryption/src/codec-server.ts)

### API contract specifications

When you create your Codec Server to handle requests from the Web UI, the following requirements must be met.

#### Endpoints

The [Web UI/CLI calls the POST method with the /decode endpoint](https://github.com/temporalio/ui/blob/11ef7ddb47711444a365c7760eae41853446da07/src/lib/services/data-encoder.ts#L38).

In your Codec Server, create a `/decode` path and pass the incoming payload to the decode method in your Payload Codec.

You can also add a [verification step](#authorization) to check whether the incoming request has the required authorization to access the decode logic in your Payload Codec.

#### Headers

Each request from the Web UI to your Codec Server includes the following headers:

- `Content-Type: application/json`: Ensure that your Codec Server can accommodate this [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types).

- `X-Namespace: {namespace}`: This is a custom HTTP Header. Ensure that the [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) configuration in your Codec Server includes this header.

- [Optional] `Authorization: <credentials>`: Include this in your CORS configuration when enabling authorization with your Codec Server.

For details on setting up authorization, see [Authorization](#authorization).

#### Request body

The general specification for the `POST` request body contains payloads.
By default, all field values in your payload are base64 encoded, regardless of whether they are encrypted by your custom codec implementation.

The following example shows a sample `POST` request body with base64 encoding.

```json
{
  "payloads": [{
    "metadata": {
      "encoding": <base64EncodedEncodingHint>
    },
    "data": <encryptedPayloadData>
  }, ...]
}
```

#### CORS

Enable [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) requests on your Codec Server to receive HTTP/HTTPS requests from the Temporal Web UI.

At a minimum, enable the following responses from your Codec Server to allow requests coming from the Temporal Web UI:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`

For example, for Temporal Cloud Web UI hosted at https://cloud.temporal.io, enable the following in your Codec Server:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://cloud.temporal.io`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Namespace, Content-Type`

For details on what a sample request/response looks like from the Temporal Web UI, see [Sample Request/Response](#sample-requestresponse).
If setting authorization, include `Authorization` in your `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.
For details on setting up authorization, see [Authorization](#authorization).

#### Authorization

To enable authorization from the Web UI (for both self-hosted Cluster and Temporal Cloud), your Codec Server must be an HTTPS Server.

**Temporal Cloud**

The Temporal Cloud UI provides an option to pass access tokens (JWT) to your Codec Server endpoints.
Use the access tokens to validate access and then return decoded payloads from the Codec Server.

You can enable this by selecting **Pass access token** in your Codec Server endpoint interface where you add your endpoint.
Enabling this option in the Temporal Cloud UI adds an authorization header to each request sent to the Codec Server endpoint that you set.

In your Codec Server implementation, verify the signature on this access token (in your authorization header) against [our JWKS endpoint](https://login.tmprl.cloud/.well-known/jwks.json).

<!-- Commenting this for now.-->
<!--If you want to unpack the claims in your token to add additional checks on whether the user has valid access to the Namespace and payloads they are trying to access, you can implement it using Auth0 SDKs, middleware, or one of the third-party libraries at JWT.io.-->

The token provided from Temporal Cloud UI contains the email identifier of the person requesting access to the payloads.
Based on the permissions you have provided to the user in your access control systems, set conditions in your Codec Server whether to return decoded payloads or just return the original encoded payloads.

**Self-hosted Temporal Cluster**

On self-hosted Temporal Clusters, configure [authorization in the Web UI configuration](/references/web-ui-configuration#auth) in your Temporal Cluster setup.

With this enabled, you can pass access tokens to your Codec Server and validate the requests from the Web UI to the Codec Server endpoints that you set.

Note that with self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you must explicitly configure authorization specifications for the Web UI and CLI.

The following sample provides implementation examples for applying authentication on your Codec Server using the Go SDK.

- [Codec Server](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server)

#### Sample request/response

Consider the following sample request/response when creating and hosting a Codec Server with the following specifications:

- Scheme: `https`
- Host: `dev.mydomain.com/codec`
- Path: `/decode`

```json
HTTP/1.1 POST /decode
Host: https://dev.mydomain.com/codec
Content-Type: application/json
X-Namespace: myapp-dev.acctid123
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{"payloads":[{"metadata":{"encoding":"anNvbi9wcm90b2J1Zg==","messageType":"dGVtcG9yYWxfc2hvcC5vcmNoZXN0cmF0aW9ucy52MS5TdGFydFNob3BwaW5nQ2FydFJlcXVlc3Q="},"data":"eyJjYXJ0SWQiOiJleGFtcGxlLWNhcnQiLCJzaG9wcGVySWQiOiJ5b3VyLXNob3BwZXItaWQtZXhhbXBsZSIsImVtYWlsIjoieW91ci1lbWFpbEBkb21haW4uY29tIn0"}]}

200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "payloads": [{
    "metadata":{
      "encoding": "json/protobuf",
      "messageType": "temporal_shop.orchestrations.v1.StartShoppingCartRequest"
    },
    "data":{
      "cartId":"example-cart",
      "shopperId":"your-shopper-id-example",
      "email":"your-email@domain.com"
    }}]
}
```

### Hosting your Codec Server

Your Codec Server can be hosted at an organization level or locally.

#### Organization-level hosting

Hosting the Codec Server for your organization simplifies both key management used for decryption and versioning the codec itself.
Consider the following details for a multi-tenant approach to setting up your Codec Server:

- Ingress: Your server will require ingress configuration for your users to access the server.
- Authorization: You must set explicit authorization checks to validate requests to your Codec Server.

#### Local hosting

Locally hosting the Codec Server is simpler to get started.
However, consider the following before choosing to do so:

- A single URL configuration is accepted for the Cloud account.
  This means some agreed-upon policy on the URL must be made for everyone using the Namespaces in this account.
  For example, if you configure your remote codec endpoint to be http://localhost:8080/codec, every developer must host your Codec Server locally at that port.

  Alternatively, you can use the local `hosts` file to allow each developer to choose where to host.
  For example, configure the remote codec endpoint as http://codec.server and allow each developer to control what it maps to locally.

- Distributing encryption keys that can decrypt the payloads at your organization can be a security risk.

### Set your Codec Server endpoints with Web UI and CLI

After you create your Codec Server and expose the requisite endpoints, set the endpoints in your Web UI and CLI.

#### Web UI

On Temporal Cloud and self-hosted Temporal Clusters, you can configure a Codec Server endpoint to be used for a Namespace in the Web UI.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Codec Server endpoint Namespace setting</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/img/set-codec-endpoint-form.png" alt="Codec Server endpoint Namespace setting" height="840" width="2004" /></div></div>

To set a Codec Server endpoint on a Namespace, do the following.

1. In the Web UI, go to Namespaces, select the Namespace where you want to configure the Codec Server endpoint, and click **Edit**.
1. In the **Codec Server** section on the Namespace configuration page, enter your Codec Server endpoint and port number.
1. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [authenticate requests](#authorization) from Temporal Web UI, enable **Pass access token** to send a JWT access token with the HTTPS requests.
1. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [verify origins of requests](#cors), enable **Include cross-origin credentials**.

Setting a Codec Server endpoint on a Namespace enables it for all users on the Namespace.
On Temporal Cloud, you must have [Namespace Admin privileges](/cloud/#namespace-level-permissions) to add a Codec Server endpoint on the Namespace.

All users on a Namespace have the option to override the Namespace-level setting at the browser level.
Overriding the Namespace-level endpoint only affects your browser.
This can be useful when developing, testing, or troubleshooting encoding functionality.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Codec Server endpoint browser setting</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/img/data-encoder-button.png" alt="Codec Server endpoint browser setting" height="333" width="720" /></div></div>

To set a browser override for the Namespace-level endpoint, do the following.

1. Navigate to **Workflows** in your Namespace.
2. In the top-right corner, select **Configure Codec Server**.
3. Select whether you want to use the Namespace-level (or Cluster-level for self-hosted Cluster) or the browser-level Codec Endpoint setting as the default for your browser.
   In Temporal Cloud:
   - **Use Namespace-level settings, where available. Otherwise, use my browser setting.**
     Uses the Namespace-level Codec Server endpoint by default.
     If no endpoint is set on the Namespace, your browser setting is applied.
   - **Use my browser setting and ignore Namespace-level setting.**
     Applies your browser-level setting by default, overriding the Namespace-level Codec Server endpoint.
4. Enter your Codec Server endpoint and port number.
5. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [authenticate requests](#authorization) from Temporal Web UI, enable **Pass access token** to send a JWT access token with the HTTPS requests.
6. Optional: If your Codec Server is configured to [verify origins of requests](#cors), enable **Include cross-origin credentials**.

In self-hosted Temporal Clusters where you set up your UI Server, you can also set the codec endpoint in the UI server [configuration file](/references/web-ui-configuration#codec), as shown in the following example.

```yaml
codec:
    endpoint: {{ default .Env.TEMPORAL_CODEC_ENDPOINT "{namespace}"}}
```

Start the UI server to use this endpoint on the Web UI for decoding data in Workflow Executions in the specified Namespace.

#### CLI

In self-hosted Temporal Clusters, after the Codec Server is started, provide the exposed endpoint to CLI using the `--codec_endpoint` command option.

For example, if you are running your Codec Server locally and expose port 8888 as your endpoint, run the following command to set the codec endpoint globally.

```bash
temporal env set --codec-endpoint "http://localhost:8888"
```

If your codec endpoint is not set globally, use the `--codec-endpoint` option with your CLI commands.
For example, to see the decoded output of the Workflow Execution "yourWorkflow" in the Namespace "yourNamespace", run the following command.

```bash
temporal --codec-endpoint "http://localhost:8888" --namespace "yourNamespace" workflow show --workflow-id "yourWorkflow"  --run-id "<yourRunId>" --output "table"
```

For details, see the [CLI reference](/cli/).

Currently in Temporal Cloud, you can set the Codec Server endpoint only from the Web UI.
