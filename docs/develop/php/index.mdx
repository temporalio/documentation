Build [Temporal Applications](/temporal#temporal-application) with the PHP SDK.

## [Core Application](/develop/php/core-application)

Use the essential components of a Temporal Application (Workflows, Activities, and Workers) to build and run a Temporal application.

- [How to develop a basic Workflow](/develop/php/core-application#develop-workflows)
- [How to develop a basic Activity](/develop/php/core-application#develop-activities)
- [How to start an Activity Execution](/develop/php/core-application#activity-execution)
- [How to run Worker Processes](/develop/php/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)

## [Temporal Client](/develop/php/temporal-clients)

Connect to a Temporal Service and start a Workflow Execution.

- [How to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Service](/develop/php/temporal-clients#connect-to-a-dev-cluster)

## [Testing](/develop/php/testing-suite)

Set up the testing suite to test Workflows and Activities.

- [Testing Activities](/develop/php/testing-suite#test-activities)
- [Testing Workflows](/develop/php/testing-suite#test-workflows)
- [How to Replay a Workflow Execution](/develop/php/testing-suite#replay)

## [Failure detection](/develop/php/failure-detection)

Explore how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

- [Workflow timeouts](/develop/php/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts)
- [How to set Activity timeouts](/develop/php/failure-detection#activity-timeouts)
- [How to Heartbeat an Activity](/develop/php/failure-detection#activity-heartbeats)

## [Workflow message passing](/develop/php/message-passing)

Send messages to read the state of Workflow Executions.

- [How to develop with Signals](/develop/php/message-passing#signals)
- [How to develop with Queries](/develop/php/message-passing#queries)
- [How to develop with Updates](/develop/php/message-passing#updates)

## [Interrupt a Workflow feature guide](/develop/php/cancellation)

Interrupt a Workflow Execution with a Cancel or Terminate action.

- [Cancel an Activity from a Workflow](/develop/php/cancellation#cancel-an-activity)

## Versioning

The PHP SDK [Versioning developer guide](/develop/php/versioning) shows how to change Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [Introduction to Versioning](/develop/php/versioning#introduction-to-versioning)
- [How to use the PHP SDK Patching API](/develop/php/versioning#php-sdk-patching-api): Patching Workflows using the PHP SDK.
- [Sanity checking](/develop/php/versioning#sanity-checking)

## [Asynchronous Activity Completion](/develop/php/asynchronous-activity-completion)


Complete Activities asynchronously.

- [How to asynchronously complete an Activity](/develop/php/asynchronous-activity-completion#asynchronous-activity-completion)

## [Observability](/develop/php/observability)

Configure and use the Temporal Observability APIs.

- [How to use Visibility APIs](/develop/php/observability#visibility)

## [Debugging](/develop/php/debugging)

Explore various ways to debug your application.

- [Debugging](/develop/php/debugging#debug)

## [Schedules](/develop/php/schedules)

Run Workflows on a schedule and delay the start of a Workflow.

- [How to use Start Delay](/develop/php/schedules#start-delay)
- [How to use Temporal Cron Jobs](/develop/php/schedules#temporal-cron-jobs)

## [Durable Timers](/develop/php/timers)

Use Timers to make a Workflow Execution pause or "sleep" for seconds, minutes, days, months, or years.

- [What is a Timer?](/develop/php/timers#timers)

## [Child Workflows](/develop/php/child-workflows)

Explore how to spawn a Child Workflow Execution and handle Child Workflow Events.

- [How to start a Child Workflow Execution](/develop/php/child-workflows#child-workflows)

## [Continue-As-New](/develop/php/continue-as-new)

Continue the Workflow Execution with a new Workflow Execution using the same Workflow ID.

- [How to Continue-As-New](/develop/php/continue-as-new#continue-as-new)

## [Side Effects](/develop/php/side-effects)

Use Side Effects in Workflows.

- [How to use Side Effects in PHP](/develop/php/side-effects#side-effects)
