These Temporal PHP SDK feature guides aim to show how to use Temporal features when developing [Temporal Applications](/temporal#temporal-application).

## Core application

The [Core Application feature guide](/develop/php/core-application) shows how to use the basic building blocks of a Temporal Application (Workflows, Activities, and Workers).

- [How to develop a basic Workflow](/develop/php/core-application#develop-workflows)
- [How to develop a basic Activity](/develop/php/core-application#develop-activities)
- [How to start an Activity Execution](/develop/php/core-application#activity-execution)
- [How to run Worker Processes](/develop/php/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)

## Temporal Clients

The [Temporal Client feature guide](/develop/php/temporal-clients) shows how to connect to a Temporal Service and start a Workflow Execution.

- [How to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Service](/develop/php/temporal-clients#connect-to-a-dev-cluster)

## Testing suites

The [Testing suite feature guide](/develop/php/testing-suite) shows how to set up the testing suite and test Workflows and Activities.

- [Testing Activities](/develop/php/testing-suite#test-activities)
- [Testing Workflows](/develop/php/testing-suite#test-workflows)
- [How to Replay a Workflow Execution](/develop/php/testing-suite#replay)

## Failure detection

The [Failure detection feature guide](/develop/php/failure-detection) shows how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

- [Workflow timeouts](/develop/php/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts)
- [How to set Activity timeouts](/develop/php/failure-detection#activity-timeouts)
- [How to Heartbeat an Activity](/develop/php/failure-detection#activity-heartbeats)

## Messages

The [Application messages feature guide](/develop/php/message-passing) shows how to send messages to and read the state of Workflow Executions.

- [How to develop with Signals](/develop/php/message-passing#signals)
- [How to develop with Queries](/develop/php/message-passing#queries)
- [How to develop with Updates](/develop/php/message-passing#updates)

## Cancellation

The [Cancellation feature guide](/develop/php/cancellation) shows how to cancel a Workflow Execution.

- [Cancel an Activity from a Workflow](/develop/php/cancellation#cancel-an-activity)

## Versioning

The [Versioning feature guide](/develop/php/versioning) shows how to change Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [Introduction to Versioning](/develop/php/versioning#introduction-to-versioning)
- [How to use the PHP SDK Patching API](/develop/php/versioning#php-sdk-patching-api): Patching Workflows using the PHP SDK.
- [Sanity checking](/develop/php/versioning#sanity-checking)

## Asynchronous Activity Completion

The [Asynchronous Activity Completion feature guide](/develop/php/asynchronous-activity-completion) shows how to complete Activities asynchronously.

- [How to asynchronously complete an Activity](/develop/php/asynchronous-activity-completion#asynchronous-activity-completion)

## Observability

The [Observability feature guide](/develop/php/observability) shows how to configure and use the Temporal Observability APIs.

- [How to use Visibility APIs](/develop/php/observability#visibility)

## Debugging

The [Debugging feature guide](/develop/php/debugging) covers the various ways to debug your application.

- [Debugging](/develop/php/debugging#debug)

## Schedules

The [Schedules feature guide](/develop/php/schedules) shows how to schedule Workflows, run Workflows on a Cron, and to delay the start of a Workflow.

- [How to use Start Delay](/develop/php/schedules#start-delay)
- [How to use Temporal Cron Jobs](/develop/php/schedules#temporal-cron-jobs)

## Child Workflows

The [Child Workflows feature guide](/develop/php/child-workflows) shows how to spawn a Child Workflow Execution and handle Child Workflow Events.

- [How to start a Child Workflow Execution](/develop/php/child-workflows#child-workflows)

## Continue-As-New

The [Continue-As-New feature guide](/develop/php/continue-as-new) shows how to continue the Workflow Execution with a new Workflow Execution using the same Workflow ID.

- [How to Continue-As-New](/develop/php/continue-as-new#continue-as-new)

## Timers

The [Durable Timers feature guide](/develop/php/timers) shows how to use Timers and sleep within Workflows.

- [What is a Timer?](/develop/php/timers#timers)

## Side Effects

The [Side Effects feature guide](/develop/php/side-effects) covers how to use Side Effects in Workflows.

- [How to use Side Effects in PHP](/develop/php/side-effects#side-effects)
