- [How to develop a basic Activity](/develop/php/core-application#develop-activities)
- [How to start an Activity Execution](/develop/php/core-application#activity-execution)
- [How to run Worker Processes](/develop/php/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)

## [Temporal Client](/develop/php/temporal-clients)

Connect to a Temporal Service and start a Workflow Execution.

- [How to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Service](/develop/php/temporal-clients#connect-to-a-dev-cluster)
- [How to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Cloud](/develop/php/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
