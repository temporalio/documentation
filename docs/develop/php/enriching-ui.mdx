# Enriching the User Interface

Enhance the Temporal UI by adding contextual information to workflows and events. This makes it easier to identify and understand workflows and their operations at a glance.

## Adding Summary and Details to Workflows

#### Starting a Workflow

When starting a workflow, you can provide a static summary and details to help identify the workflow in the UI:

```php
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient;
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowOptions;

// Create workflow client
$workflowClient = WorkflowClient::create($serviceClient);

// Start a workflow with static summary and details
$workflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    YourWorkflow::class,
    WorkflowOptions::new()
        ->withWorkflowId('your-workflow-id')
        ->withTaskQueue('your-task-queue')
        ->withStaticSummary('Order processing for customer #12345')
        ->withStaticDetails('Processing premium order with expedited shipping')
);

$result = $workflow->yourWorkflowMethod('workflow input');
```

`withStaticSummary()` sets a single-line description that appears in the workflow list view, limited to 200 bytes.
`withStaticDetails()` sets multi-line comprehensive information that appears in the workflow details view, with a larger limit of 20K bytes.

The input format is normal Markdown excluding: images, html, and scripts.

You can also start a workflow asynchronously:

```php
// Start workflow asynchronously
$workflowClient->start($workflow, 'workflow input');
```

#### Adding Summary to Activities and Timers

You can attach a `summary` to timers within a workflow:

```php
use Temporal\Workflow;
use Temporal\Workflow\TimerOptions;

#[WorkflowInterface]
interface YourWorkflow
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function yourWorkflowMethod(string $input): string;
}

class YourWorkflowImpl implements YourWorkflow
{
    public function yourWorkflowMethod(string $input): \Generator
    {
        // Create a timer with a summary
        yield Workflow::timer(
            300, // 5 minutes in seconds
            TimerOptions::new()->withSummary('Waiting for payment confirmation')
        );
        
        return 'Timer completed';
    }
}
```

For activities, you can set a summary using activity options:

```php
use Temporal\Activity\ActivityOptions;
use Temporal\Workflow;

class YourWorkflowImpl implements YourWorkflow
{
    private YourActivitiesInterface $activities;
    
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->activities = Workflow::newActivityStub(
            YourActivitiesInterface::class,
            ActivityOptions::new()
                ->withStartToCloseTimeout('10 seconds')
                ->withSummary('Processing user data')
        );
    }
    
    public function yourWorkflowMethod(string $input): \Generator
    {
        // Execute the activity with the summary
        $result = yield $this->activities->yourActivity($input);
        
        return $result;
    }
}
```

The input format for `summary` is a string, and limited to 200 bytes.
