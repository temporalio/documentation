In addition to the normal development tools of logging and a debugger, you can also see what's happening in your Workflow by using the [Web UI](/web-ui) or [Temporal CLI](/cli).

### How to debug in a development production {#debug-in-a-development-production}

You can debug production Workflows using:

You can debug and tune Worker performance with metrics and the [Worker performance guide](/develop/worker-performance).
