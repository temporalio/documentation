## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when [starting the Workflow Execution](#workflow-timeouts).

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-execution-timeout)** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-run-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-task-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

Create an instance of `WorkflowOptions` in the Client code and set your timeout.

Available timeouts are:

- `withWorkflowExecutionTimeout()`
- `withWorkflowRunTimeout()`
- `withWorkflowTaskTimeout()`

```php
$workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    DynamicSleepWorkflowInterface::class,
    WorkflowOptions::new()
        ->withWorkflowId(DynamicSleepWorkflow::WORKFLOW_ID)
        ->withWorkflowIdReusePolicy(WorkflowIdReusePolicy::WORKFLOW_ID_REUSE_POLICY_ALLOW_DUPLICATE)
        // Set Workflow Timeout duration
        ->withWorkflowExecutionTimeout(CarbonInterval::minutes(2))
        // ->withWorkflowRunTimeout(CarbonInterval::minute(2))
        // ->withWorkflowTaskTimeout(CarbonInterval::minute(2))
);
```

### Workflow retries {#workflow-retries}

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

A Retry Policy can be configured with an instance of the `RetryOptions` object.
To enable retries for a Workflow, you need to provide a Retry Policy object via `ChildWorkflowOptions` for Child Workflows or via `WorkflowOptions` for top-level Workflows.

```php
$workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
      CronWorkflowInterface::class,
      WorkflowOptions::new()->withRetryOptions(
        RetryOptions::new()->withInitialInterval(120)
      )
);
```

## How to set Activity timeouts {#activity-timeouts}

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **[Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution).
- **[Start-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum time allowed for a single [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution).
- **[Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-start-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/workers#activity-task) is scheduled to when a [Worker](/workers#worker) starts that Activity Task.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

Because Activities are reentrant, only a single stub can be used for multiple Activity invocations.

Available timeouts are:

- withScheduleToCloseTimeout()
- withStartToCloseTimeout()
- withScheduleToStartTimeout()

```php
$this->greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    // Set Activity Timeout duration
    ActivityOptions::new()
        ->withScheduleToCloseTimeout(CarbonInterval::seconds(2))
        // ->withStartToCloseTimeout(CarbonInterval::seconds(2))
        // ->withScheduleToStartTimeout(CarbonInterval::seconds(10))
);
```

### How to set an Activity Retry Policy {#activity-retries}

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) if a custom one is not provided.

To set an Activity Retry, set `{@link RetryOptions}` on `{@link ActivityOptions}`.
The follow example creates a new Activity with the given options.

```php
$this->greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    ActivityOptions::new()
        ->withScheduleToCloseTimeout(CarbonInterval::seconds(10))
        ->withRetryOptions(
            RetryOptions::new()
                ->withInitialInterval(CarbonInterval::seconds(1))
                ->withMaximumAttempts(5)
                ->withNonRetryableExceptions([\InvalidArgumentException::class])
        )
);
}
```

For an executable code sample, see [ActivityRetry sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/tree/master/app/src/ActivityRetry) in the PHP samples repository.

### How to set the required Activity Timeouts {#required-timeout}

Activity Execution semantics rely on several parameters.
The only required value that needs to be set is either a [Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout) or a [Start-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout).
These values are set in the Activity Options.

## How to Heartbeat an Activity {#activity-heartbeats}

An [Activity Heartbeat](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat) is a ping from the [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) that is executing the Activity to the [Temporal Service](/clusters).
Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Service that the [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution) is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.
If the Temporal Service does not receive a Heartbeat within a [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout) time period, the Activity will be considered failed and another [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution) may be scheduled according to the Retry Policy.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Temporal Serviceâ€”they may be [throttled](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#throttling) by the Worker.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Temporal Service when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Temporal Service.

Some Activities are long-running.
To react to a crash quickly, use the Heartbeat mechanism, `Activity::heartbeat()`, which lets the Temporal Server know that the Activity is still alive.
This acts as a periodic checkpoint mechanism for the progress of an Activity.

You can piggyback `details` on an Activity Heartbeat.
If an Activity times out, the last value of `details` is included in the `TimeoutFailure` delivered to a Workflow.
Then the Workflow can pass the details to the next Activity invocation.
Additionally, you can access the details from within an Activity via `Activity::getHeartbeatDetails`.
When an Activity is retried after a failure `getHeartbeatDetails` enables you to get the value from the last successful Heartbeat.

```php
use Temporal\Activity;

class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities
{
    // ...
    public function download(
        string $bucketName,
        string $remoteName,
        string $localName
    ): void
    {
        $this->dowloader->downloadWithProgress(
            $bucketName,
            $remoteName,
            $localName,
            // on progress
            function ($progress) {
                Activity::heartbeat($progress);
            }
        );

        Activity::heartbeat(100); // download complete

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

#### How to set a Heartbeat Timeout {#heartbeat-timeout}

A [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout) works in conjunction with [Activity Heartbeats](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat).

Some Activities are long-running.
To react to a crash quickly, use the Heartbeat mechanism, `Activity::heartbeat()`, which lets the Temporal Server know that the Activity is still alive.
This acts as a periodic checkpoint mechanism for the progress of an Activity.

You can piggyback `details` on an Activity Heartbeat.
If an Activity times out, the last value of `details` is included in the `TimeoutFailure` delivered to a Workflow.
Then the Workflow can pass the details to the next Activity invocation.
Additionally, you can access the details from within an Activity via `Activity::getHeartbeatDetails`.
When an Activity is retried after a failure `getHeartbeatDetails` enables you to get the value from the last successful Heartbeat.

```php
use Temporal\Activity;

class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities
{
    // ...
    public function download(
        string $bucketName,
        string $remoteName,
        string $localName
    ): void
    {
        $this->dowloader->downloadWithProgress(
            $bucketName,
            $remoteName,
            $localName,
            // on progress
            function ($progress) {
                Activity::heartbeat($progress);
            }
        );

        Activity::heartbeat(100); // download complete

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```
