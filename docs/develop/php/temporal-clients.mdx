## How to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Cluster {#connect-to-a-dev-cluster}

A [Temporal Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the [Temporal Cluster](/clusters).
Communication with a Temporal Cluster includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.

:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.

:::

When you are running a Cluster locally (such as the [Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/server#start-dev)), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.
Many SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).

Create an instance of the `$workflowClient` class and use the `create()` method to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Cluster.

Specify the target host, `localhost:7223`, parameter as a string and provide the TLS configuration for connecting to a Temporal Cluster.

```php
use Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient;
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowOptions;
# . . .
$workflowClient = Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient::create(
     ServiceClient::createSSL(
         'localhost:7233',
         'certs/ca.cert',
         'certs/client.key',
         'certs/client.pem',
         'tls-sample',
     ),
 );
```

To provide the client options as an environmental variable, add the `tls` option to the RoadRunner configuration file and pass the path to the file.

```yml
temporal:
  # . . .
  tls:
    key: 'certs/client.key'
    cert: 'certs/client.pem'
    root_ca: 'certs/ca.cert'
    client_auth_type: require_and_verify_client_cert
    server_name: 'tls-sample'
```

Then update your application and use the SSL connection for `ServiceClient`.

```php
$workflowClient = Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient::create(
     ServiceClient::createSSL(
         'localhost:7233',
         getenv('TEMPORAL_SERVER_ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH'),
         getenv('TEMPORAL_CLIENT_KEY_PATH'),
         getenv('TEMPORAL_CLIENT_CERT_PATH'),
         getenv('TEMPORAL_SERVER_NAME_OVERRIDE')
     ),
 );
```
