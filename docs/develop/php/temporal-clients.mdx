description: Learn to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Service and start Workflow Executions. This guide covers communication, including sending signals and queries.
---

This guide introduces Temporal Clients.
It explains the role and use of Clients and shows you how to configure your PHP Client code to connect to the Temporal Service.

The pages shows how to do the following:

- [Connect to a local development Temporal Service](#connect-to-a-dev-cluster)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](#start-workflow-execution)
- [Advanced connection options](#advanced-connection-options)

## How to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Service {#connect-to-a-dev-cluster}

A [Temporal Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the [Temporal Service](/clusters).
Communication with a Temporal Service includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Scheduling Workflow Executions.
- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.

:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Service.

:::

When you are running a Temporal Service locally (such as the [Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/server#start-dev)), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.
Many SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).

In the PHP SDK, different client classes are responsible for different functional areas.
The [`ServiceClient`](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Client-GRPC-ServiceClient.html) is responsible for the low-level API and connection to the Temporal Service.
It is also used in higher-level clients: [`WorkflowClient`](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Client-WorkflowClient.html) and [`ScheduleClient`](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Client-ScheduleClient.html).

:::note

RoadRunner is not required to work only with the client API; however, the [gRPC extension](https://pecl.php.net/package/grpc) is necessary.

:::

Use `create()` factory methods to create clients.

```php
use Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient;
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient;

$serviceClient = ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233');
$workflowClient = WorkflowClient::create($serviceClient);

// Use $workflowClient to work with Workflows ...
```

## How to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Cloud {#connect-to-temporal-cloud}

When you connect to [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), you need to provide additional connection and client options that include the following:

- The [Temporal Cloud Namespace Id](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-namespace-id).
- The [Namespace's gRPC endpoint](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-grpc-endpoint).
  An endpoint listing is available at the [Temporal Cloud Website](https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces) on each Namespace detail page.
  The endpoint contains the Namespace Id and port.
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates).

For more information about configuring TLS to secure inter- and intra-network communication for a Temporal Service, see [Temporal Customization Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server).

Use the [`ServiceClient::createSSL()`](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Client-GRPC-BaseClient.html#method_createSSL) method to configure a client connection to the Temporal Service.
The `$clientKey` argument must be combined with the `$clientPem` to authenticate the Client.

```php
use Temporal\Client\ClientOptions;
use Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient;
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient;

$serviceClient = \Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient::createSSL(
    address: '<your-custom-namespace>.tmprl.cloud:7233',
    // crt: 'certs/server-root-ca-cert.pem', # ROOT CA to validate the server cert
    clientKey: 'certs/client-private-key.pem',
    clientPem: 'certs/client-cert.pem',
    // overrideServerName: 'tls-sample',
);

$workflowClient = WorkflowClient::create(
    serviceClient: $serviceClient,
    options: (new ClientOptions())
        ->withNamespace('<your-custom-namespace>.<id>'),
);
```

To [run Worker processes](/develop/php/core-application#run-a-dev-worker) managed by Temporal Cloud, configure RoadRunner in the same way.

```yml
temporal:
  # ...
  tls:
    # root_ca: 'certs/server-root-ca-cert.pem'
    key: 'certs/client-private-key.pem'
    cert: 'certs/client-cert.pem'
    client_auth_type: require_and_verify_client_cert
    # server_name: 'tls-sample'
```

To set up the [API key](/cloud/api-keys) in the Client, use the [`ServiceClient::withAuthKey()`](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Client-GRPC-BaseClient.html#method_withAuthKey) method:

```php
$serviceClient = \Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient::createSSL(/*...*/)
    ->withAuthKey('your-api-key');
```

## How to start a Workflow Execution {#start-workflow-execution}

[Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) semantics rely on several parameters—that is, to start a Workflow Execution you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type, language-specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

In the examples below, all Workflow Executions are started using a Temporal Client.
To spawn Workflow Executions from within another Workflow Execution, use either the [Child Workflow](/develop/php/child-workflows) or External Workflow APIs.

See the [Customize Workflow Type](/develop/php/core-application#workflow-type) section to see how to customize the name of the Workflow Type.

A request to spawn a Workflow Execution causes the Temporal Service to create the first Event ([WorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#workflowexecutionstarted)) in the Workflow Execution Event History.
The Temporal Service then creates the first Workflow Task, resulting in the first [WorkflowTaskScheduled](/references/events#workflowtaskscheduled) Event.

Workflows can be started both synchronously and asynchronously.
You can use typed or untyped Workflows stubs available via `Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient`.
To create a Workflow Client:

```php
use Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient;
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient;

$workflowClient = WorkflowClient::create(ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233'));
```

**Synchronous start**

A synchronous start initiates a Workflow and then waits for its completion. The started Workflow will not rely on the
invocation process and will continue executing even if the waiting process crashes or stops.

Be sure to acquire the Workflow interface or class name you want to start.
For example:

```php
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface AccountTransferWorkflowInterface
{
    #[WorkflowMethod(name: "MoneyTransfer")]
    #[ReturnType('int')]
    public function transfer(
        string $fromAccountId,
        string $toAccountId,
        string $referenceId,
        int $amountCents
    );
}
```

To start the Workflow in sync mode:

```php
$accountTransfer = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class
);

$result = $accountTransfer->transfer(
    'fromID',
    'toID',
    'refID',
    1000
);
```

**Asynchronous start**

An asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller without waiting for a result.
This is the most common way to start Workflows in a live environment.

To start a Workflow asynchronously, pass the Workflow stub instance and start parameters into the `WorkflowClient`->`start` method.

```php
$accountTransfer = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class
);

$run = $this->workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);
```

After the Workflow is started, you can receive the Workflow Id via the `WorkflowRun` object returned by the `start` method:

```php
$run = $workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);

var_dump($run->getExecution()->getID());
```

**Recurring start**

You can start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule with [the CronSchedule option](/develop/php/schedules).

### How to set a Workflow's Task Queue {#set-task-queue}

In most SDKs, the only Workflow Option that must be set is the name of the [Task Queue](/task-queue).

For any code to execute, a Worker Process must be running that contains a Worker Entity that is polling the same Task Queue name.

In PHP, a Task Queue is represented in code by its name as a `string`.
There are four places where the name of the Task Queue is supplied by the developer.

1. When starting a Workflow, a Task Queue name must be provided in the `StartWorkflowOptions`.

```php
// Create new Workflow Options and set the Task Queue
$workflowOptions = WorkflowOptions::new()
  ->withTaskQueue("Workflow-Task-Queue-1")
  // ...

$yourWorkflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
  YourWorkflowInterface::class,
  $workflowOptions
);

$result = $yourWorkflow->workflowMethod();
```

2. A Task Queue name must be provided as a parameter when creating a Worker.

```php
use Temporal\WorkerFactory;

// Create a Worker Factory
$factory = WorkerFactory::create();

// Set the Task Queue when creating the Worker
$worker = $factory->newWorker("Workflow-Task-Queue-1");

// Workflows are stateful. So you need a type to create instances.
$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(YourWorkflow::class);

// start primary loop
$factory->run();
```

A single Worker can listen to only one Task Queue.
And, it is important to remember that the name of the Task Queue the Worker is listening to must match the name of the Task Queue provided in the options to any given Workflow or Activity.

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it will fail that Task.
However, the failure of the Task will not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

3. Optionally, the name of a Task Queue can be provided in the `ActivityOptions` when calling an Activity from a Workflow.

```php
class YourWorkflow implements YourWorkflowInterface
{
  private $yourActivity;

  public function __construct()
  {
    // Create Activity options and set the Task Queue
    $activityOptions = ActivityOptions::new()
      ->withTaskQueue("Activity-Task-Queue-1")
      // ...

    // Create a new Activity Stub and pass the options
    $this->yourActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
      YourActivityInterface::class,
      $activityOptions
    );
  }

  public function workflowMethod(): \Generator
  {
    // Call the Activity
    return yield $this->yourActivity->activityMethod();
  }
}
```

If a Task Queue name is not provided in the `ActivityOptions`, then the Activity Tasks are placed in the same Task Queue as the Workflow Task Queue.

4. Optionally, the name of a Task Queue can be provided in the `ChildWorkflowOptions` when calling a Child Workflow.

```php
//Create new Child Workflow Options and set the Task Queue
$childWorkflowOptions = ChildWorkflowOptions::new()
    ->withTaskQueue("Child-Workflow-Task-Queue-1")
    // ...

// Create a new Child Workflow Stub and set the Task Queue
$childWorkflow = Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub(
    ChildWorkflowInterface::class,
    $childWorkflowOptions
);

// Call the Child Workflow method
$promise = $childWorkflow->workflowMethod();
```

If a Task Queue name is not provided in the `ChildWorkflowOptions`, then the Child Workflow Tasks are placed in the same Task Queue as the Parent Workflow Task Queue.

### How to set a Workflow Id {#workflow-id}

Although it is not required, we recommend providing your own [Workflow Id](/workflows#workflow-id) that maps to a business process or business entity identifier, such as an order identifier or customer identifier.

The following code example grabs the `userID` as an input and uses it to start the Workflow. The `userID` is used as Workflow Id. You can use this to cancel your Workflow later.

```php
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface SubscriptionWorkflowInterface
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function subscribe(string $userID);
}
```

The following code example, uses the input parameter `userID` as the Workflow Id.

```php
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface SubscriptionWorkflowInterface
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function subscribe(
        string $userID
    );
}
```

You can also set the Workflow Id as a constant, for example:

```php
public const WORKFLOW_ID = Your-Workflow-Id
```

### How to get the results of a Workflow Execution {#get-workflow-results}

If the call to start a Workflow Execution is successful, you will gain access to the Workflow Execution's Run Id.

The Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace may be used to uniquely identify a Workflow Execution in the system and get its result.

It's possible to both block progress on the result (synchronous execution) or get the result at some other point in time (asynchronous execution).

In the Temporal Platform, it's also acceptable to use Queries as the preferred method for accessing the state and results of Workflow Executions.

If you need to wait for the completion of a Workflow after an asynchronous start, make a blocking call to
the `WorkflowRun`->`getResult` method.

```php
$run = $workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);

var_dump($run->getResult());
```


## Advanced connection options {#advanced-connection-options}

In PHP, it is common practice to work with resources in blocking mode.
Long blocks can quickly exhaust the pool of available workers and lead to application failure.

This section introduces features and configuration examples of the PHP SDK when working with the Temporal Client API.

### Connection

gRPC connections in the PHP SDK are lazy by default, meaning they are not established until the first call.
To force establishing the connection to the Temporal Service, you can call the [`ConnectionInterface::connect()`](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Client-GRPC-Connection-ConnectionInterface.html#method_connect) or [`ServiceClient::getServerCapabilities()`](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Client-GRPC-ServiceClientInterface.html#method_getServerCapabilities) method.

```php
// ...
$serviceClient->getConnection()->connect(timeout: 10);

// or
$serviceClient->getServerCapabilities();
```

If, for some reason, the established connection is broken, the SDK will automatically attempt to restore it, taking into account the configured retry policy.

### Retry policy {#configure-rpc-retry-policy}

Whenever the client fails to connect to the server, an error with a status code is generated.
If the status code is `UNKNOWN`, `UNAVAILABLE`, or `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, the client will make another connection attempt.
By default, the number of attempts is unlimited, and the interval between them will range from 0.5 to 100 seconds with a backoff coefficient of 2.
This means that the client will likely be blocked until it establishes a connection to the server through infinite attempts.

If you want to change the default behavior, use the `withRetryPolicy()` method when creating a client service:

```php
use Temporal\Client\Common\RpcRetryOptions;
use Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient;
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient;

$serviceClient = ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233');
$workflowClient = WorkflowClient::create($serviceClient)
    ->withRetryOptions(
        RpcRetryOptions::new()
            ->withMaximumAttempts(10)
            ->withInitialInterval('1 second')   // The first retry will be in 1 second
            ->withBackoffCoefficient(2.5)       // Each next retry time will be multiplied by 2.5
            ->withMaximumInterval('20 seconds') // The maximum interval between attempts
            ->withMaximumJitterCoefficient(0.2) // Actual retry time can be +/- 20% of the calculated time
    );
```

### RPC timeout {#configure-rpc-timeout}

When the client calls the service's RPC, there is no default time limit for waiting for a response. This can result in the code call `$result = $workflowHandle->getResult();` blocking the PHP worker until the Workflow completes. In some cases, this is not the desired behavior, and there may be a need to set a reasonable timeout for waiting for the RPC to complete.

Use the `withTimeout()` method to build a client with a timeout for all RPC calls.

```php
use Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient;
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient;

$serviceClient = ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233');
$workflowClient = WorkflowClient::create($serviceClient)
    ->withTimeout(5.75);

// Create a Workflow stub
$stub = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class);

// If the Workflow does not complete within 5.75 seconds, a TimeoutException will be thrown
$result = $stub->transfer('fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);
```

:::note

The `withTimeout()` method is immutable.
If you need to change the timeout for individual operations, create a new client from the existing one with a specific timeout: `$newClient = $workflowClient->withTimeout(0);` (`0` means no timeout).
