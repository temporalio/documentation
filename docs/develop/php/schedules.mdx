description: Learn how to use Workflow Start Delay and Temporal Cron Jobs in PHP. Delay Workflow execution or set up recurring tasks with a Cron Schedule using Temporal Client.
---

This page shows how to do the following:

- [How to use Start Delay](#start-delay)
- [How to use Temporal Cron Jobs](#temporal-cron-jobs)

## How to use Start Delay {#start-delay}

Use the Workflow [Start Delay](/workflows#delay-workflow-execution) functionality if you need to delay the execution of the Workflow without the need for regular launches.
Here you simply specify the time to wait before dispatching the first Workflow task.

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    GreeterWorkflowInterface::class,
    WorkflowOptions::new()
        ->withWorkflowStartDelay(CarbonInterval::minutes(10)),
);
$workflowClient->start($workflow, 'Hello world!');
```

## How to use Temporal Cron Jobs {#temporal-cron-jobs}

:::caution Cron support is not recommended

We recommend using [Schedules](https://docs.temporal.io/workflows#schedule) instead of Cron Jobs.
Schedules were built to provide a better developer experience, including more configuration options and the ability to update or pause running Schedules.

:::

A [Temporal Cron Job](/workflows#temporal-cron-job) is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.

A Cron Schedule is provided as an option when the call to spawn a Workflow Execution is made.

Set your Cron Schedule with `CronSchedule('* * * * *')`.

The following example sets a Cron Schedule in PHP:

```php
  $workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
      CronWorkflowInterface::class,
      WorkflowOptions::new()
          ->withWorkflowId(CronWorkflowInterface::WORKFLOW_ID)
          ->withCronSchedule('* * * * *')
          // Execution timeout limits total time. Cron will stop executing after this timeout.
          ->withWorkflowExecutionTimeout(CarbonInterval::minutes(10))
          // Run timeout limits duration of a single workflow invocation.
          ->withWorkflowRunTimeout(CarbonInterval::minute(1))
  );

  $output->writeln("Starting <comment>CronWorkflow</comment>... ");

  try {
      $run = $this->workflowClient->start($workflow, 'Antony');
      // ...
  }
```

Setting `withCronSchedule` turns the Workflow Execution into a Temporal Cron Job.
For more information, see the [PHP samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/tree/master/app/src/Cron) for example code or the PHP SDK `WorkflowOptions` [source code](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/blob/master/src/Client/WorkflowOptions.php).
