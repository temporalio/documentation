This page describes how to Continue-As-New using the Temporal .NET SDK.

[Continue-As-New](/workflow-execution/continue-as-new) enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation if the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.
The Workflow Execution spawned from the use of Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.

:::caution

As a precautionary measure, the Workflow Execution's Event History is limited to [51,200 Events](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/e3496b1c51bfaaae8142b78e4032cc791de8a76f/service/history/configs/config.go#L382) or [50 MB](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/e3496b1c51bfaaae8142b78e4032cc791de8a76f/service/history/configs/config.go#L380) and will warn you after 10,240 Events or 10 MB.

:::

To prevent a Workflow Execution Event History from exceeding this limit and failing, use Continue-As-New to start a new Workflow Execution with a fresh Event History.

A very large Event History can adversely affect the performance of a Workflow Execution.
For example, in the case of a Workflow Worker failure, the full Event History must be pulled from the Temporal Service and given to another Worker via a Workflow Task.
If the Event history is very large, it may take some time to load it.

The Continue-As-New feature enables developers to complete the current Workflow Execution and start a new one atomically.

The new Workflow Execution has the same Workflow Id, but a different Run Id, and has its own Event History.

To Continue-As-New in .NET, throw an exception created by `CreateContinueAsNewException()` from inside your Workflow, which will stop the Workflow immediately and Continue-As-New.

```csharp
throw Workflow.CreateContinueAsNewException((MyWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(myNewParam));
```

:::warning Using Continue-as-New and Updates

- Temporal _does not_ support Continue-as-New functionality within Update handlers.
- Complete all handlers _before_ using Continue-as-New.
- Use Continue-as-New from your main Workflow Definition method, just as you would complete or fail a Workflow Execution.
