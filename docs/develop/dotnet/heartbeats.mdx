## Heartbeat an Activity {#Activity-heartbeats}

**How to Heartbeat an Activity using the Temporal .NET SDK**

An [Activity Heartbeat](/activities#activity-heartbeat) is a ping from the [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) that is executing the Activity to the [Temporal Cluster](/clusters).
Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Cluster that the [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution) is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.
If the Cluster does not receive a Heartbeat within a [Heartbeat Timeout](/activities#heartbeat-timeout) time period, the Activity will be considered failed and another [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution) may be scheduled according to the Retry Policy.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Clusterâ€”they may be [throttled](/activities#throttling) by the Worker.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Cluster when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `Details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `Details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Cluster.

To Heartbeat an Activity Execution in .NET, use the [`Heartbeat()`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Activities.ActivityExecutionContext.html#Temporalio_Activities_ActivityExecutionContext_Heartbeat_System_Object___) method on the `ActivityExecutionContext`.

```csharp
[Activity]
public async Task MyActivityAsync()
{
    while (true)
    {
        // Send heartbeat
        ActivityExecutionContext.Current.Heartbeat();

        // Do some work, passing the cancellation token
        await Task.Delay(1000, ActivityExecutionContext.Current.CancellationToken);
    }
}
```

In addition to obtaining cancellation information, Heartbeats also support detail data that persists on the server for retrieval during Activity retry.
If an Activity calls `Heartbeat(123, 456)` and then fails and is retried, `HeartbeatDetails` on the `ActivityInfo` returns an collection containing `123` and `456` on the next Run.

#### Set a Heartbeat Timeout {#heartbeat-timeout}

**How to set a Heartbeat Timeout using the Temporal .NET SDK**

A [Heartbeat Timeout](/activities#heartbeat-timeout) works in conjunction with [Activity Heartbeats](/activities#activity-heartbeat).

`HeartbeatTimeout` is a property on `ActivityOptions` for `ExecuteActivityAsync` used to set the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.

```csharp
await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
    (MyActivities a) => a.MyActivity(param),
    new()
    {
        StartToCloseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
        HeartbeatTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
    });
```
