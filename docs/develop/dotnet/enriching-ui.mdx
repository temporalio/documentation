Temporal supports adding context to Workflows and events with metadata. 
This helps users identify and understand Workflows and their operations.

## Adding Summary and Details to Workflows

### Starting a Workflow

When starting a workflow, you can provide a static summary and details to help identify the workflow in the UI:

```csharp
using Temporalio.Client;

// Create client
var client = await TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(new("localhost:7233"));

// Start a workflow with static summary and details
var handle = await client.StartWorkflowAsync(
    (YourWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync("workflow input"),
    new WorkflowOptions
    {
        Id = "your-workflow-id",
        TaskQueue = "your-task-queue",
        StaticSummary = "Order processing for customer #12345",
        StaticDetails = "Processing premium order with expedited shipping"
    });
```

`StaticSummary` is a single-line description that appears in the workflow list view, limited to 200 bytes.
`StaticDetails` can be multi-line and provides more comprehensive information that appears in the workflow details view, with a larger limit of 20K bytes.

The input format is normal Markdown excluding: images, html, and scripts.

You can also use `ExecuteWorkflowAsync` for synchronous execution:

```csharp
var result = await client.ExecuteWorkflowAsync(
    (YourWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync("workflow input"),
    new WorkflowOptions
    {
        Id = "your-workflow-id",
        TaskQueue = "your-task-queue",
        StaticSummary = "Order processing for customer #12345",
        StaticDetails = "Processing premium order with expedited shipping"
    });
```

### Inside the Workflow

Within a Workflow, you can get and set the _current workflow details_. 
Unlike static summary/details set at Workflow start, this value can be updated throughout the life of the Workflow. 
Current Workflow details also takes Markdown format (again, excluding images, html, and scripts) and can span multiple lines.

```csharp
using Temporalio.Workflows;

[Workflow]
public class YourWorkflow
{
    [WorkflowRun]
    public async Task<string> RunAsync(string input)
    {
        // Get the current details
        var currentDetails = Workflow.CurrentDetails;
        Workflow.Logger.LogInformation($"Current details: {currentDetails}");
        
        // Set/update the current details
        Workflow.CurrentDetails = "Updated workflow details with new status";
        
        return "Workflow completed";
    }
}
```

### Adding Summary to Activities and Timers

You can attach a `Summary` to activities when starting them from within a Workflow:

```csharp
using Temporalio.Activities;
using Temporalio.Workflows;

[Workflow]
public class YourWorkflow
{
    [WorkflowRun]
    public async Task<string> RunAsync(string input)
    {
        // Execute an activity with a summary
        var result = await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
            (YourActivities act) => act.YourActivityAsync(input),
            new ActivityOptions
            {
                StartToCloseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),
                Summary = "Processing user data"
            });
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

Similarly, you can attach a `Summary` to timers within a Workflow:

```csharp
using Temporalio.Workflows;

[Workflow]
public class YourWorkflow
{
    [WorkflowRun]
    public async Task<string> RunAsync(string input)
    {
        // Create a timer with a summary
        await Workflow.DelayWithOptionsAsync(new DelayOptions(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5))
        {
            Summary = "Waiting for payment confirmation"
        });
        
        return "Timer completed";
    }
}
```

The input format for `Summary` is a string, and limited to 200 bytes.
