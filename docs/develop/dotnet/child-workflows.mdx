This page describes how to start a Child Workflow Execution using the Temporal .NET SDK.

A [Child Workflow Execution](/encyclopedia/child-workflows) is a Workflow Execution that is scheduled from within another Workflow using a Child Workflow API.

When using a Child Workflow API, Child Workflow related Events ([StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#startchildworkflowexecutioninitiated), [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted), [ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutioncompleted), etc...) are logged in the Workflow Execution Event History.

Always block progress until the [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted) Event is logged to the Event History to ensure the Child Workflow Execution has started.
After that, Child Workflow Executions may be abandoned using the default _Abandon_ [Parent Close Policy](/encyclopedia/child-workflows#parent-close-policy) set in the Child Workflow Options.

To spawn a Child Workflow Execution in .NET, use the `ExecuteChildWorkflowAsync()` method which starts the Child Workflow and waits for completion or
use the `StartChildWorkflowAsync()` method to start a Child Workflow and return its handle.
This is useful if you want to do something after it has only started, or to get the Workflow/Run ID, or to be able to signal it while running.

:::note

`ExecuteChildWorkflowAsync()` is a helper method for `StartChildWorkflowAsync()` plus `await handle.GetResultAsync()`.

:::

```csharp
await Workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflowAsync((MyChildWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync());
```

## Set Parent Close Policy {#parent-close-policy}

**How to set a Parent Close Policy using the Temporal .NET SDK.**

A [Parent Close Policy](/encyclopedia/child-workflows#parent-close-policy) determines what happens to a Child Workflow Execution if its Parent changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, or Timed Out).

The default Parent Close Policy option is set to terminate the Child Workflow Execution.

Set the `ParentClosePolicy` property inside the [`ChildWorkflowOptions`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Workflows.ChildWorkflowOptions.html) for `ExecuteChildWorkflowAsync` or `StartChildWorkflowAsync` to specify the behavior of the Child Workflow when the Parent Workflow closes.

```csharp
await Workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflowAsync(
  (MyChildWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(),
  new() { ParentClosePolicy = ParentClosePolicy.Abandon });
```
