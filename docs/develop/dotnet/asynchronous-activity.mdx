This page describes how to asynchronously complete an Activity.

[Asynchronous Activity Completion](/activities#asynchronous-activity-completion) enables the Activity Function to return without the Activity Execution completing.

There are three steps to follow:

1. The Activity provides the external system with identifying information needed to complete the Activity Execution.
   Identifying information can be a [Task Token](/activities#task-token), or a combination of Namespace, Workflow Id, and Activity Id.
2. The Activity Function completes in a way that identifies it as waiting to be completed by an external system.
3. The Temporal Client is used to Heartbeat and complete the Activity.

To mark an Activity as completing asynchronously, do the following inside the Activity.

```csharp
// Capture token for later completion
capturedToken = ActivityExecutionContext.Current.Info.TaskToken;

// Throw special exception that says an activity will be completed somewhere else
throw new CompleteAsyncException();
```

To update an Activity outside the Activity, use the [GetAsyncActivityHandle()](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Client.ITemporalClient.html#Temporalio_Client_ITemporalClient_GetAsyncActivityHandle_System_Byte___) method to get the handle of the Activity.

```csharp
var handle = myClient.GetAsyncActivityHandle(capturedToken);
```

Then, on that handle, you can call the results of the Activity, `HeartbeatAsync`, `CompleteAsync`, `FailAsync`, or `ReportCancellationAsync` method to update the Activity.

```csharp
await handle.CompleteAsync("Completion value.");
```
