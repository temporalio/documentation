## How to interrupt a Workflow Execution {#interrupt-a-workflow-execution}

You can interrupt a Workflow Execution in one of the following ways:

- [Cancel](#cancel)
- [Terminate](#terminate)

The following are the main differences between canceling and terminating a Workflow in Temporal:

##### Summary

In summary:

- Canceling provides a graceful way to stop the Workflow and allows it to handle cancelation logic.
- Termination forcefully stops the Workflow and prevents any further events.

In most cases, canceling is preferable because it allows the Workflow to finish gracefully.
Terminate only if the Workflow is stuck and cannot be canceled normally.
