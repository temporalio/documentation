description: The Testing section of the Temporal Developer's guide covers the many ways to test the state of your Temporal Application; that is, ways to view which Workflow Executions are tracked by the Platform and the state of any given Workflow Execution, either currently or at points of an execution.

The .NET test-suite feature guide describes the frameworks that facilitate Workflow and integration testing.

In the context of Temporal, you can create these types of automated tests:

- **End-to-end:** Running a Temporal Server and Worker with all its Workflows and Activities; starting and interacting with Workflows from a Client.
- **Integration:** Anything between end-to-end and unit testing.
  - Running Activities with mocked Context and other SDK imports (and usually network requests).
  - Running Workers with mock Activities, and using a Client to start Workflows.
  - Running Workflows with mocked SDK imports.
- **Unit:** Running a piece of Workflow or Activity code (a function or method) and mocking any code it calls.

We generally recommend writing the majority of your tests as integration tests.

Because the test server supports skipping time, use the test server for both end-to-end and integration tests with Workers.
