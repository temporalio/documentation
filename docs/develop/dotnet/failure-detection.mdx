## Failure Detection {#failure-detection}

## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when [starting the Workflow Execution](#workflow-timeouts).

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/workflows#workflow-execution-timeout)** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/workflows#workflow-run-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/workflows#workflow-task-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

These values can be set in the `WorkflowOptions` when calling `StartWorkflowAsync` or `ExecuteWorkflowAsync`.

Available timeouts are:

- ExecutionTimeout
- RunTimeout
- TaskTimeout

```csharp
var result = await client.ExecuteWorkflowAsync(
    (MyWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(),
    new(id: "my-workflow-id", taskQueue: "my-task-queue")
    {
        WorkflowExecutionTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
    });
```

### Workflow retries {#workflow-retries}

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/retry-policies) to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

The `RetryPolicy` can be set in the `WorkflowOptions` when calling `StartWorkflowAsync` or `ExecuteWorkflowAsync`.

```csharp
var result = await client.ExecuteWorkflowAsync(
    (MyWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(),
    new(id: "my-workflow-id", taskQueue: "my-task-queue")
    {
        RetryPolicy = new() { MaximumInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10) },
    });
```

## How to set Activity timeouts {#activity-timeouts}

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **[Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution).
- **[Start-To-Close Timeout](/activities#start-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum time allowed for a single [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution).
- **[Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/activities#schedule-to-start-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/workers#activity-task) is scheduled to when a [Worker](/workers#worker) starts that Activity Task.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

These values can be set in the `ActivityOptions` when calling `ExecuteActivityAsync`.

Available timeouts are:

- ScheduleToCloseTimeout
- ScheduleToStartTimeout
- StartToCloseTimeout

```csharp
return await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
    (MyActivities a) => a.MyActivity(param),
    new() { StartToCloseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5) });
```

### How to set an Activity Retry Policy {#activity-retries}

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default [Retry Policy](/retry-policies) if a custom one is not provided.

To create an Activity Retry Policy in .NET, set the `RetryPolicy` on the `ActivityOptions` when calling `ExecuteActivityAsync`.

```csharp
return await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
    (MyActivities a) => a.MyActivity(param),
    new()
    {
        StartToCloseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
        RetryPolicy = new() { MaximumInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10) },
    });
```
