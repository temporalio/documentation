<!-- .NET SDK feature guidance landing page-->

The following Temporal .NET SDK feature guides aim to show how to use Temporal features when developing [Temporal Applications](/temporal#temporal-application).

## Core application

The [Core application feature guide](/develop/dotnet/core-application) shows how to use the basic building blocks of a Temporal Application (Workflows, Activities, and Workers).

- [Develop a basic Workflow Definition](/develop/dotnet/core-application#develop-workflow): Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a Workflow Definition.
- [Develop a basic Activity Definition](/develop/dotnet/core-application#develop-activity): One of the primary things that Workflows do is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
- [Start an Activity from a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/core-application#activity-execution): Calls to spawn Activity Executions are written within a Workflow Definition.
- [Run a Worker Process](/develop/dotnet/core-application#run-worker-process): The Worker Process is where Workflow Functions and Activity Functions are executed.
- [Set a Dynamic Workflow](/develop/dotnet/core-application#set-a-dynamic-workflow): Set a workflow that can be invoked dynamically at runtime.
- [Set a Dynamic Activity](/develop/dotnet/core-application#set-a-dynamic-activity): Set an Activity that can be invoked dynamically at runtime.

## Temporal Client

The [Temporal Client feature guide](/develop/dotnet/temporal-client) shows how to connect to a Temporal Service and start a Workflow Execution.

- [Create a Temporal Client](/develop/dotnet/temporal-client#create-a-client): Learn to instantiate and configure a client to interact with the Temporal Service.
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](/develop/dotnet/temporal-client#connect-to-temporal-cloud): Securely connect to the Temporal Cloud for a fully managed service.
- [Start a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/temporal-client#start-workflow): Initiate Workflows seamlessly via the .NET SDK.

The [Failure detection feature guide](/develop/dotnet/failure-detection) shows how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

- [Workflow timeouts](/develop/dotnet/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts): Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

- [Dynamic Handler](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#dynamic-handler): Dynamic Handlers provide flexibility to handle cases where the names of Workflows, Activities, Signals, or Queries aren't known at run time.
- [Set a Dynamic Signal](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#set-a-dynamic-signal): A Dynamic Signal in Temporal is a Signal that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Signal with the same input is registered.

**Queries**

- [Define a Query](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#queries): A Query is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.
- [Send Queries](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#send-query): Queries are sent from the Temporal Client.
- [Set a Dynamic Query](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#set-a-dynamic-signal): A Dynamic Query in Temporal is a Query that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Query with the same name is registered.

**Updates**

- [Define an Update](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#updates): An Update is an operation that can mutate the state of a Workflow Execution and return a response.
- [Send an Update](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#send-update-from-client): An Update is sent from the Temporal Client.

## Interrupt a Workflow

The [Interrupt a Workflow feature guide](/develop/dotnet/cancellation) shows how to interrupt a Workflow Execution with a Cancel or Terminate action.

- [Cancel a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/cancellation#cancellation): Interrupt a Workflow Execution and its Activities through Workflow cancellation.
- [Terminate a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/cancellation#termination): Interrupt a Workflow Execution and its Activities through Workflow termination.

## Versioning

The [Versioning feature guide](/develop/dotnet/versioning) shows how to change Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [Use the .NET SDK Patching API](/develop/dotnet/versioning#dotnet-sdk-patching-api): Patching Workflows using the .NET SDK.

## Observability

The [Observability feature guide](/develop/dotnet/observability) shows how to configure and use the Temporal Observability APIs.
