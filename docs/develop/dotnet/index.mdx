<!-- .NET SDK feature guidance landing page-->

This section contains the following feature guidance for the Temporal .NET SDK.

## Core Application

- [Develop a basic Workflow Definition](/develop/dotnet/core-application#develop-workflow): Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a Workflow Definition.
- [Develop a basic Activity Definition](/develop/dotnet/core-application#develop-activity): One of the primary things that Workflows do is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
- [Start an Activity from a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/core-application#activity-execution): Calls to spawn Activity Executions are written within a Workflow Definition.
- [Run a Worker Process](/develop/dotnet/core-application#run-worker-process): The Worker Process is where Workflow Functions and Activity Functions are executed.
- [Set a Dynamic Workflow](/develop/dotnet/core-application#set-a-dynamic-workflow): Set a workflow that can be invoked dynamically at runtime.
- [Set a Dynamic Activity](/develop/dotnet/core-application#set-a-dynamic-activity): Set an Activity that can be invoked dynamically at runtime.

## Temporal Client
- [Create a Temporal Client](/develop/dotnet/temporal-client#create-a-client): Learn to instantiate and configure a client to interact with the Temporal Service.
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](/develop/dotnet/temporal-client#connect-to-temporal-cloud): Securely connect to the Temporal Cloud for a fully managed service.
- [Start a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/temporal-client#start-workflow): Initiate Workflows seamlessly via the .NET SDK.
- [Get Workflow results](/develop/dotnet/temporal-client#get-workflow-results): Retrieve and process the results of your Workflows efficiently. 

## Testing
- [Test frameworks](/develop/dotnet/testing-suite#test-frameworks): Testing provides a framework to facilitate Workflow and integration testing.
- [Testing Workflows](/develop/dotnet/testing-suite#testing-workflows): Ensure the functionality and reliability of your Workflows.
- [Testing Activities](/develop/dotnet/testing-suite#test-activities): Validate the execution and outcomes of your Activities.
- [Replay test](/develop/dotnet/testing-suite#replay-test): Replay recreates the exact state of a Workflow Execution.

## Failure Detection

- [Workflow timeouts](/develop/dotnet/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts): Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.
- [Workflow retries](/develop/dotnet/failure-detection#workflow-retries): A Workflow Retry Policy can be used to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.
- [Activity timeouts ](/develop/dotnet/failure-detection#activity-timeouts): Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.
- [Set an Activity Retry Policy](/develop/dotnet/failure-detection#activity-retries): Define retry logic for Activities to handle failures.

## Message Passing
**Signals**
- [Define Signal](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#define-a-signal): A Signal is a message sent to a running Workflow Execution.
- [Send a Signal from a Temporal Client](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#send-signal-from-client): Send a Signal to a Workflow from a Temporal Client.
- [Send a Signal from a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#send-signal-from-workflow): Send a Signal to another Workflow from within a Workflow, this would also be called an External Signal.
- [Signal-With-Start](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#signal-with-start): Start a Workflow and send it a Signal in a single operation used from the Client. 
- [Set a Dynamic Signal](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#set-a-dynamic-signal): A Dynamic Signal in Temporal is a Signal that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Signal with the same input is registered. 

**Queries**
- [Define a Query](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#define-query): A Query is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.
- [Send Queries](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#send-query): Queries are sent from the Temporal Client. 
- [Set a Dynamic Query](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#set-a-dynamic-query): A Dynamic Query in Temporal is a Query that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Query with the same name is registered.

**Updates**
- [Define an Update](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#define-update): An Update is an operation that can mutate the state of a Workflow Execution and return a response.
- [Send an Update](/develop/dotnet/message-passing#send-update): An Update is sent from the Temporal Client. 

## Cancel and Terminate

- [Cancel a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/cancellation#cancellation): Interrupt a Workflow Execution and its Activities through Workflow cancellation.
- [Terminate a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/cancellation#termination): Interrupt a Workflow Execution and its Activities through Workflow termination.

## Heartbeat
- [Heartbeat an Activity](#activity-heartbeats): An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster.
- [Set a Heartbeat Timeout](#heartbeat-timeout): A Heartbeat Timeout works in conjunction with Activity Heartbeats. 

## Versioning

- [Use the .NET SDK Patching API](/develop/dotnet/versioning#dotnet-sdk-patching-api): Patching Workflows using the .NET SDK. 

## Observability

- [Emit Metrics](/develop/dotnet/observability#metrics): Each Temporal SDK is capable of emitting an optional set of metrics from either the Client or the Worker process.
- [Set up Tracing](/develop/dotnet/observability#tracing): Explains how the Go SDK supports tracing and custom context propogation.
- [Log from a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/observability#logging): Send logs and errors to a logging service, so that when things go wrong, you can see what happened.
- [Use Visibility APIs](/develop/dotnet/observability#visibility): The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Terminal Service. 

## Debugging
- [Debug in a development environment](/develop/dotnet/debugging#debug-in-a-development-environment): In addition to the normal development tools of logging and a debugger, you can also see what’s happening in your Workflow by using the Web UI and the Temporal CLI.
- [Debug in a development production ](/develop/dotnet/debugging#debug-in-a-development-production): Debug production Workflows using the Web UI, the Temporal CLI, Replays, Tracing, or Logging.

## Schedules
- [Schedule a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/schedules#schedule-a-workflow): 
- [Create a Scheduled Workflow](/develop/dotnet/schedules#create-a-workflow): Create a new schedule for a scheduled Workflow. 
- [Backfill a Scheduled Workflow](/develop/dotnet/schedules#backfill-a-scheduled-workflow): Backfills a past time range of actions for a scheduled Workflow. 
- [Delete a Scheduled Workflow](/develop/dotnet/schedules#delete-a-scheduled-workflow): Deletes a schedule for a scheduled Workflow. 
- [Describe a Scheduled Workflow](/develop/dotnet/schedules#describe-a-scheduled-workflow): Get schedule configuration and current state for a scheduled Workflow. 
- [List a Scheduled Workflow](/develop/dotnet/schedules#list-a-scheduled-workflow): List a schedule for a scheduled Workflow.
- [Pause a Scheduled Workflow](/develop/dotnet/schedules#pause-a-scheduled-workflow): Pause a schedule for a scheduled Workflow. 
- [Trigger a Scheduled Workflow](/develop/dotnet/schedules#trigger-a-scheduled-workflow): Triggers an immediate action for a scheduled Workflow. 
- [Update a Scheduled Workflow](/develop/dotnet/schedules#update-a-scheduled-workflow): Updates a schedule with a new definition for a scheduled Workflow. 
- [Use Start Delay](/develop/dotnet/schedules#start-delay): Start delay functionality if you need to delay the execution of the Workflow without the need for regular launches. 

## Data Encryption

- [How to use a custom Payload Codec](/develop/dotnet/data-encryption#custom-payload-codec): Create a custom PayloadCodec implementation and define your encryption/compression and decryption/decompression logic.
- [How to use a custom Payload Converter](/develop/dotnet/data-encryption#custom-payload-converter): A custom data converter can be set via the `DataConverter` option when creating a client. 

## Durable Timers

- [Sleep](/develop/dotnet/durable-timers): A Timer lets a Workflow sleep for a fixed time period.


## Continue-As-New

- [Continue-As-New](/develop/dotnet/continue-as-new): Continue-As-New enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation if the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.

## Child Workflows

- [Child Workflows](/develop/dotnet/child-workflows): A Child Workflow Execution is a Workflow Execution that is scheduled from within another Workflow using a Child Workflow API.

## Asynchronous Activity

- [Asynchronous Activity](/develop/dotnet/asynchronous-activity): Asynchronous Activity Completion enables the Activity Function to return without the Activity Execution completing.
