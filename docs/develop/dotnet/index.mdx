## Install and get started

You can find detailed installation instructions for the .NET SDK in the [Quickstart](/develop/dotnet/set-up-your-local-dotnet).

There's also a short walkthrough of how to use the Temporal primitives (Activities, Workflows, and Workers) to build and run a Temporal application to get you up and running.

Once your local Temporal Service is set up, continue building with the following resources:

- [Workflow Basics](/develop/dotnet/workflows/basics)
- [Activity Basics](/develop/dotnet/activities/basics)
- [Start an Activity Execution](/develop/dotnet/activities/execution)
- [Run Worker Processes](/develop/dotnet/workers/run-worker-process)

From there, you can dive deeper into any of the Temporal primitives to start building Workflows that fit your use cases.
