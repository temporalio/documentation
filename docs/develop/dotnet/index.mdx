This section contains the following feature guidance for the Temporal .NET SDK.

## Core Application

- [Develop a basic Workflow Definition](/develop/dotnet/core-application#develop-workflow): Develop a basic Workflow with the Temporal .NET SDK 
- [Develop a basic Activity Definition](/develop/dotnet/core-application#develop-activity): Create a basic Activity with the .NET SDK, and understand their role in Workflows
- [Start an Activity from a Workflow](/develop/dotnet/core-application#activity-execution): Learn to start an Activity from a Workflow.
- [Run a Worker Process](/develop/dotnet/core-application#run-worker-process): Create and run a Worker Process effectively. 
- [Set a Dynamic Workflow](/develop/dotnet/core-application#set-a-dynamic-workflow): Set a workflow that can be invoked dynamically at runtime 
- [Set a Dynamic Activity](/develop/dotnet/core-application#set-a-dynamic-activity): Set an Activity that can be invoked dynamically at runtime 

## Temporal Client
- [Create a Temporal Client](/develop/dotnet/temporal-client#create-a-client): Learn to instantiate and configure a client to interact with the Temporal Service.
