## Create a Temporal Client {#create-a-client}

**How to create a Temporal Client using the Temporal .NET SDK**

A [Temporal Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the [Temporal Service](/temporal-service).
Communication with a Temporal Service includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.

:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Service.

:::

When you are running a Temporal Service locally (such as the [Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/server#start-dev)), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.
Many SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).

Use the `ConnectAsync()` static method on the `Temporalio.Client.TemporalClient` class to create and connect to a Temporal Client to the Temporal Service.

```csharp
var client = await TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(new("localhost:7233"));
```

## Connect to Temporal Cloud {#connect-to-temporal-cloud}

### How to connect to Temporal Cloud using an API Key {#connect-to-temporal-cloud-api-key}

To use an [API key](/cloud/api-keys) with the Temporal .NET SDK, you will need to provide additional connection options:

- Your _API Key_ value
- Your _Namespace and Account id_ combination, which follows the format `<namespace_id>.<account_id>`.
- The _endpoint_ may vary. The most common endpoint used is the gRPC regional endpoint, which follows the format: `<region>.<cloud_provider>.api.temporal.io:7233`.
- For Namespaces with High Availability features with API key authentication enabled, use the gRPC Namespace endpoint: `<namespace>.<account>.tmprl.cloud:7233`.
  This allows automated failover without needing to switch endpoints.

You can find the Namespace and Account ID, as well as the endpoint, on the Namespaces tab:

![The Namespace and Account ID combination on the left, and the regional endpoint on the right](/cloud/apikeys/namespaces-and-regional-endpoints.png)

Now, when instantiating a Temporal `client in your .NET SDK code, provide the `Namespace` and `ApiKey` values.

To create an initial connection:

```csharp
var myClient = TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(new(<endpoint>)
{
    Namespace = "<namespace_id>.<account_id>",
    ApiKey = "<APIKey>",
    Tls = new(),
});
```

To update an API key, update the value of `ApiKey`:

```csharp
myClient.Connection.ApiKey = myKeyUpdated;
```

### How to connect to Temporal Cloud using TLS {#connect-to-temporal-cloud-tls}

When you connect to [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), you need to provide additional connection and client options that include the following:

- The [Temporal Cloud Namespace Id](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-namespace-id).
- The [Namespace's gRPC endpoint](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-grpc-endpoint).
  An endpoint listing is available at the [Temporal Cloud Website](https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces) on each Namespace detail page.
  The endpoint contains the Namespace Id and port.
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates).

For more information about configuring TLS to secure inter- and intra-network communication for a Temporal Service, see [Temporal Customization Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server).

Use the `ConnectAsync()` static method on the `Temporalio.Client.TemporalClient` class to create and connect to a Temporal Client to the Temporal Service.
Specify the `Tls` property of the connection options to connect to a Temporal Service with TLS enabled.

```csharp
var client = await TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(new("my-namespace.a1b2c.tmprl.cloud:7233")
{
    Namespace = "my-namespace.a1b2c",
    Tls = new()
    {
        ClientCert = await File.ReadAllBytesAsync("my-cert.pem"),
        ClientPrivateKey = await File.ReadAllBytesAsync("my-key.pem"),
    },
});
```

## Start a Workflow {#start-workflow}

**How to start a Workflow using the Temporal .NET SDK**

[Workflow Execution](/workflow-execution) semantics rely on several parameters—that is, to start a Workflow Execution you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type, language-specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

A request to spawn a Workflow Execution causes the Temporal Service to create the first Event ([WorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#workflowexecutionstarted)) in the Workflow Execution Event History.
The Temporal Service then creates the first Workflow Task, resulting in the first [WorkflowTaskScheduled](/references/events#workflowtaskscheduled) Event.

To start a Workflow Execution in .NET, use either the `StartWorkflowAsync()` or `ExecuteWorkflowAsync()` methods in the Client.
You must set a [Workflow Id](/workflow-execution/workflowid-runid#workflow-id) and [Task Queue](/task-queue) in the `WorkflowOptions` given to the method.

```csharp
var result = await client.ExecuteWorkflowAsync(
    (MyWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(),
    new(id: "my-workflow-id", taskQueue: "my-task-queue");
Console.WriteLine("Result: {0}", result);
```

## Get Workflow results {#get-workflow-results}

**How to get the results of a Workflow Execution using the Temporal .NET SDK**

If the call to start a Workflow Execution is successful, you will gain access to the Workflow Execution's Run Id.

The Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace may be used to uniquely identify a Workflow Execution in the system and get its result.

It's possible to both block progress on the result (synchronous execution) or get the result at some other point in time (asynchronous execution).

In the Temporal Platform, it's also acceptable to use Queries as the preferred method for accessing the state and results of Workflow Executions.

Use `StartWorkflowAsync()` or `GetWorkflowHandle()` to return a Workflow handle.
Then use the `GetResultAsync()` method to await on the result of the Workflow.

To get a handle for an existing Workflow by its Id, you can use `GetWorkflowHandle()`.

Then use [`DescribeAsync()`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Client.WorkflowHandle.html#Temporalio_Client_WorkflowHandle_DescribeAsync_Temporalio_Client_WorkflowDescribeOptions_) to get the current status of the Workflow.
If the Workflow does not exist, this call fails.

```csharp
var handle = client.GetWorkflowHandle("my-workflow-id");
var result = await client.GetResultAsync<string>();
Console.WriteLine("Result: {0}", result);
```
