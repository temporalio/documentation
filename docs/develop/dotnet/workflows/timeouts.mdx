## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when [starting the Workflow Execution](#workflow-timeouts).

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-execution-timeout)** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-run-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-task-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

These values can be set in the `WorkflowOptions` when calling `StartWorkflowAsync` or `ExecuteWorkflowAsync`.

Available timeouts are:

- ExecutionTimeout
- RunTimeout
- TaskTimeout

```csharp
var result = await client.ExecuteWorkflowAsync(
    (MyWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(),
    new(id: "my-workflow-id", taskQueue: "my-task-queue")
    {
        WorkflowExecutionTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
    });
```

### Set Workflow retries {#workflow-retries}

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

The `RetryPolicy` can be set in the `WorkflowOptions` when calling `StartWorkflowAsync` or `ExecuteWorkflowAsync`.

```csharp
var result = await client.ExecuteWorkflowAsync(
    (MyWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(),
    new(id: "my-workflow-id", taskQueue: "my-task-queue")
    {
        RetryPolicy = new() { MaximumInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10) },
    });
```
