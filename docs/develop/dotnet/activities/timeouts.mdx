## Activity Timeouts {#activity-timeouts}

Each Activity Timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following Timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **[Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall [Activity Execution](/activity-execution).
- **[Start-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum time allowed for a single [Activity Task Execution](/tasks#activity-task-execution).
- **[Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-start-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/tasks#activity-task) is scheduled to when a [Worker](/workers#worker) starts that Activity Task.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

These values can be set in the `ActivityOptions` when calling `ExecuteActivityAsync`.

Available timeouts are:

- ScheduleToCloseTimeout
- ScheduleToStartTimeout
- StartToCloseTimeout

```csharp
return await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
    (MyActivities a) => a.MyActivity(param),
    new() { StartToCloseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5) });
```

### Set an Activity Retry Policy {#activity-retries}

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) if a custom one is not provided.

To create an Activity Retry Policy in .NET, set the `RetryPolicy` on the `ActivityOptions` when calling `ExecuteActivityAsync`.

```csharp
return await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
    (MyActivities a) => a.MyActivity(param),
    new()
    {
        StartToCloseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
        RetryPolicy = new() { MaximumInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10) },
    });
```

### Override the Retry interval with `nextRetryDelay` {#next-retry-delay}

When you throw an [Application Failure](/references/failures#application-failure) and assign the `nextRetryDelay` field, its value replaces and overrides the Retry interval defined in the active Retry Policy.

For example, you might scale the next Retry delay interval based on the current number of attempts.
Here's how you'd do that in an Activity.
In the following sample, the `attempt` count is retrieved from the Activity Execution context and used to set the number of seconds for the next Retry delay:

```csharp
var attempt = ActivityExecutionContext.Current.Info.Attempt;

throw new ApplicationFailureException(
    $"Something bad happened on attempt {attempt}",
    errorType: "my_failure_type",
    nextRetryDelay: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3 * attempt));
```

## Heartbeat an Activity {#activity-heartbeats}

An [Activity Heartbeat](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat) is a ping from the [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) that is executing the Activity to the [Temporal Service](/temporal-service).
Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Service that the [Activity Execution](/activity-execution) is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.
If the Temporal Service does not receive a Heartbeat within a [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout) time period, the Activity will be considered failed and another [Activity Task Execution](/tasks#activity-task-execution) may be scheduled according to the Retry Policy.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Temporal Service—they may be [throttled](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#throttling) by the Worker.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Temporal Service when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `Details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `Details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Temporal Service.

To Heartbeat an Activity Execution in .NET, use the [`Heartbeat()`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Activities.ActivityExecutionContext.html#Temporalio_Activities_ActivityExecutionContext_Heartbeat_System_Object___) method on the `ActivityExecutionContext`.

```csharp
[Activity]
public async Task MyActivityAsync()
{
    while (true)
    {
        // Send heartbeat
        ActivityExecutionContext.Current.Heartbeat();

        // Do some work, passing the cancellation token
        await Task.Delay(1000, ActivityExecutionContext.Current.CancellationToken);
    }
}
```

In addition to obtaining cancellation information, Heartbeats also support detail data that persists on the server for retrieval during Activity retry.
If an Activity calls `Heartbeat(123, 456)` and then fails and is retried, `HeartbeatDetails` on the `ActivityInfo` returns an collection containing `123` and `456` on the next Run.

### Set a Heartbeat Timeout {#heartbeat-timeout}

A [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout) works in conjunction with [Activity Heartbeats](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat).

`HeartbeatTimeout` is a property on `ActivityOptions` for `ExecuteActivityAsync` used to set the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.

```csharp
await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
    (MyActivities a) => a.MyActivity(param),
    new()
    {
        StartToCloseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
        HeartbeatTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
    });
```
