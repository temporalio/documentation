This page shows how to do the following:

- [Understand types of tests](#types-of-tests)
- [Use compatible test frameworks](#test-frameworks)
- [Test Workflows](#testing-workflows)
- [Test Activities](#test-activities)
- [Replay tests](#replay-test)

The Ruby test-suite feature guide describes the frameworks that facilitate Workflow and integration testing.

## Types of Tests {#types-of-tests}

In the context of Temporal, you can create these types of automated tests:

- **End-to-end:** Running a Temporal Server and Worker with all its Workflows and Activities; starting and interacting with Workflows from a Client.
- **Integration:** Anything between end-to-end and unit testing.
  - Running Activities with mocked Context and other SDK imports (and usually network requests).
  - Running Workers with mock Activities, and using a Client to start Workflows.
  - Running Workflows with mocked SDK imports.
- **Unit:** Running a piece of Workflow or Activity code and mocking any code it calls.

We generally recommend writing the majority of your tests as integration tests.

Because the test server supports skipping time, use the test server for both end-to-end and integration tests with Workers.

## Test frameworks {#test-frameworks}

**Compatible testing frameworks**

The Ruby SDK is compatible with any testing framework and does not have a specific recommendation.
Most Ruby SDK samples use [minitest](https://github.com/minitest/minitest).

## Testing Workflows {#testing-workflows}

Workflow testing can be done in an integration-test fashion against a real server, however it is hard to simulate timeouts and other long time-based code.
Using the time-skipping Workflow test environment can help there.

### Testing Workflows with standard server

A non-time-skipping `Temporalio::Testing::WorkflowEnvironment` can be started via `start_local` which supports all standard Temporal features.
It is actually the real Temporal dev server packaged in the Temporal CLI, lazily downloaded on first use, and run as a sub-process in the background.
Assuming tests properly use separate Task Queues, the same server can and should be reused across tests.

Here's a simple example of a Workflow:

```ruby
class SimpleWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute(name)
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end
end
```

Here's how a test of that Workflow may appear in minitest:

```ruby
def test_simple_workflow
  # Start local server that is stopped when block is done
  Temporalio::Testing::WorkflowEnvironment.start_local do |env|
    # Start worker that is stopped when block is done
    worker = Temporalio::Worker.new(
      env.client,
      task_queue: "tq-#{SecureRandom.uuid}",
      workflows: [SimpleWorkflow]
    )
    worker.run do
      # Execute workflow and check result
      result = env.client.execute_workflow(
        SimpleWorkflow, 'some-name',
        id: "wf-#{SecureRandom.uuid}", task_queue: worker.task_queue
      )
      assert_equal 'Hello, some-name!', result
    end
  end
end
```

While this is just a demonstration, a local server is often used as a fixture across many tests.
In minitest for instance, users often start the environment lazily (with no block), and shut it down inside a block passed to `Minitest.after_run`.

### Testing Workflows with time skipping

Sometimes there is a need to test Workflows that run a long time or to test that timeouts occur.
A time-skipping `Temporalio::Testing::WorkflowEnvironment` can be started via `start_time_skipping` which is a reimplementation of the Temporal server with special time skipping capabilities.
Like `start_local`, this also lazily downloads the process to run when first called.
Note, unlike `start_local`, this class is not thread safe nor safe for use with independent tests.
It can be technically be reused, but only for one test at a time because time skipping is locked/unlocked at the environment level.
Developers are encouraged to run it per test needed.

#### Automatic time skipping

Here's a simple example of a Workflow that waits a day:

```ruby
class WaitADayWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute
    Temporalio::Workflow.sleep(1 * 24 * 60 * 60)
    'all done'
  end
end
```

A regular integration test of this Workflow on a normal server would be way too slow.
However, the time-skipping server automatically skips to the next event when we wait on the result.
Here's a test for that Workflow in minitest:

```ruby
def test_wait_a_day_workflow
  # Start time-skipping test server that is stopped when block is done
  Temporalio::Testing::WorkflowEnvironment.start_time_skipping do |env|
    # Start worker that is stopped when block is done
    worker = Temporalio::Worker.new(
      env.client,
      task_queue: "tq-#{SecureRandom.uuid}",
      workflows: [WaitADayWorkflow]
    )
    worker.run do
      # Execute workflow and check result
      result = env.client.execute_workflow(
        WaitADayWorkflow,
        id: "wf-#{SecureRandom.uuid}", task_queue: worker.task_queue
      )
      assert_equal 'all done', result
    end
  end
end
```

This test will run almost instantly.
This is because by calling `execute_workflow` on our client, we are actually calling `start_workflow` + `result`, and `result` automatically skips time as much as it can (basically until the end of the workflow or until an activity is run).

To disable automatic time-skipping while waiting for a workflow result, run code in a block passed to `env.auto_time_skipping_disabled`.

#### Manual time skipping

Until a Workflow is waited on, all time skipping in the time-skipping environment is done manually via `WorkflowEnvironment#sleep`.

Here's a Workflow that waits for a Signal or times out:

```ruby
class SignalWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute
    # Wait for signal or timeout in 45 seconds
    Temporalio::Workflow.timeout(45 * 60) do
      Temporalio::Workflow.wait_condition { @signal_received }
    end
    'got signal'
  rescue Timeout::Error
    'got timeout'
  end

  workflow_signal
  def some_signal
    @signal_received = true
  end
end
```

To test a normal Signal in minitest, you might:

```ruby
def test_signal_workflow
  Temporalio::Testing::WorkflowEnvironment.start_time_skipping do |env|
    worker = Temporalio::Worker.new(
      env.client,
      task_queue: "tq-#{SecureRandom.uuid}",
      workflows: [SignalWorkflow]
    )
    worker.run do
      handle = env.client.start_workflow(
        SignalWorkflow,
        id: "wf-#{SecureRandom.uuid}", task_queue: worker.task_queue
      )
      handle.signal(SignalWorkflow.some_signal)
      assert_equal 'got signal', handle.result
    end
  end
end
```

But how would you test the timeout part? Like so:

```ruby
def test_signal_workflow_timeout
  Temporalio::Testing::WorkflowEnvironment.start_time_skipping do |env|
    worker = Temporalio::Worker.new(
      env.client,
      task_queue: "tq-#{SecureRandom.uuid}",
      workflows: [SignalWorkflow]
    )
    worker.run do
      handle = env.client.start_workflow(
        SignalWorkflow,
        id: "wf-#{SecureRandom.uuid}", task_queue: worker.task_queue
      )
      # Advance 50 seconds
      env.sleep(50)
      assert_equal 'got timeout', handle.result
    end
  end
end
```

### Mocking Activities

When testing Workflows, often you don't want to actually run the Activities.
Activities are just classes that extend `Temporalio::Activity::Definition`.
Simply write different/empty/fake/asserting ones and pass those to the Worker to have different activities called during the test.

## Testing Activities {#test-activities}

Unit testing an Activity or any code that could run in an Activity is done via the `Temporalio::Testing::ActivityEnvironment` class.
Simply instantiate the class, and any code inside the block to `run` will be invoked inside the activity context.
Several things about the activity environment can be customized via parameters when constructing the environment including setting the info, providing a proc to call back on each heartbeat, setting the cancellation to be used, etc.

## Replay test {#replay-test}

Given a Workflow's history, it can be replayed locally to check for things like non-determinism errors.
For example, assuming the `history_json` parameter below is given a JSON string of history exported from the CLI or web UI for workflow `MyWorkflow`, the following method will replay it:

```ruby
def replay_from_json(history_json)
  # Create a replayer
  replayer = Temporalio::Worker::WorkflowReplayer.new(workflows: [MyWorkflow])
  # Replay the history
  history = Temporalio::WorkflowHistory.from_history_json(history_json)
  replayer.replay_workflow(history)
end
```

If there is a non-determinism, this will raise an exception.

Workflow history can be loaded from more than just JSON.
It can be fetched individually from a Workflow handle, or even in a list.
For example, the following code will check that all Workflow histories for a certain Workflow type (i.e. workflow class) are safe with the current Workflow code.

```ruby
# Create a replayer
replayer = Temporalio::Worker::WorkflowReplayer.new(workflows: [MyWorkflow])
# Replay all workflows from a list
replayer.replay_workflows(client.list_workflows("WorkflowType = 'MyWorkflow'")).each do |result|
  # Raise if any failed (could have just set raise_on_replay_failure: true, but this
  # demonstrates iterating over the results)
  raise result.replay_failure if result.replay_failure
end
```
