## Create a Temporal Client {#create-a-client}

A [Temporal Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the [Temporal Service](/temporal-service).
Communication with a Temporal Service includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.
  All applications that need to communicate directly with the Temporal Service will run inside of Temporal Clients.

Your Workers are technically Temporal Clients, because they need to poll the Temporal Service to actually do work.
Your Workflow and Activity definitions are _not_ Temporal Clients -- your Worker imports these directly instead.
Each Temporal SDK includes a set of Temporal Client functions.
The `temporal` CLI is also a Temporal Client, and is generally at feature parity with the SDKs.
:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Service.

:::

When running a Temporal Service locally (such as via [Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/server#start-dev)), the number of connection options required is minimal.

Use the `connect` class method on the `Temporalio::Client` class to create and connect to a Temporal Client to the Temporal Service.

```ruby
client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'default')
```

## Connect to Temporal Cloud {#connect-to-temporal-cloud}

### How to connect to Temporal Cloud using an API Key {#connect-to-temporal-cloud-api-key}

To use an [API key](/cloud/api-keys) with the Temporal Ruby SDK, you will need to provide additional connection options:

- Your _API Key_ value
- Your _Namespace and Account id_ combination, which follows the format `<namespace_id>.<account_id>`.
- The _endpoint_ may vary. The most common endpoint used is the gRPC regional endpoint, which follows the format: `<region>.<cloud_provider>.api.temporal.io:7233`.
- For Namespaces with High Availability features with API key authentication enabled, use the gRPC Namespace endpoint: `<namespace>.<account>.tmprl.cloud:7233`.
  This allows automated failover without needing to switch endpoints.

You can find the Namespace and Account ID, as well as the endpoint, on the Namespaces tab:

![The Namespace and Account ID combination on the left, and the regional endpoint on the right](/img/cloud/apikeys/namespaces-and-regional-endpoints.png)

Now, when instantiating a Temporal client in your Ruby SDK code, provide the `api_key` value.

To create an initial connection:

```ruby
client = Temporalio::Client.connect(
  '<endpoint>', # Endpoint
  '<namespace_id>.<account_id>', # Namespace
  api_key: '<api_key>',
  tls: true
)
```

To update an API key, update the value of `api_key`:

```ruby
client.connection.api_key = '<updated_api_key>'
```

### How to connect to Temporal Cloud using mTLS {#connect-to-temporal-cloud-mtls}

When you connect to [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), you need to provide additional connection and client options that include the following:

- The [Temporal Cloud Namespace Id](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-namespace-id).
- The [Namespace's gRPC endpoint](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-grpc-endpoint).
  An endpoint listing is available at the [Temporal Cloud Website](https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces) on each Namespace detail page.
  The endpoint contains the Namespace Id and port.
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates).

For more information about configuring TLS to secure inter- and intra-network communication for a Temporal Service, see [Temporal Customization Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server).

Use the `connect` static method on the `Temporalio::Client` class to create and connect to a Temporal Client to the Temporal Service.
Specify the `tls` parameter of the connection options to connect to a Temporal Service with mTLS enabled.

```ruby
client = Temporalio::Client.connect(
  '<endpoint>', # Endpoint
  '<namespace_id>.<account_id>', # Namespace
  tls: Temporalio::Client::Connection::TLSOptions.new(
    client_cert: File.read('my-client-cert.pem'),
    client_private_key: File.read('my-client-key.pem')
  )
)
```

## Start a Workflow {#start-workflow}

To start a Workflow Execution, supply:

- A Task Queue
- A Workflow Type
- Input arguments
- Workflow options such as Workflow Id

To start a Workflow Execution in Ruby, use either the `start_workflow` or `execute_workflow` methods in the Client.
You must set a [Workflow Id](/workflow-execution/workflowid-runid#workflow-id) and [Task Queue](/task-queue) in the parameters given to the method.

```ruby
result = my_client.execute_workflow(
  MyWorkflow, 'some-input',
  id: 'my-workflow-id', task_queue: 'my-task-queue'
)
puts "Result: #{result}"
```

## Get Workflow results {#get-workflow-results}

Once a Workflow Execution is started, the Workflow Id and Run Id can be used to uniquely identify it.

You can block until the result is available, or retrieve it later using the handle.

You can also use Queries to access Workflow state and results while the Workflow is running.

Use `start_workflow` or `workflow_handle` on the Client to return a Workflow handle.
Then use the `result` method to await on the result of the Workflow.

```ruby
handle = my_client.workflow_handle('my-workflow-id')
result = handle.result
puts "Result: #{result}"
```
