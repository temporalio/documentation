A [Temporal Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the Temporal Service.
Communication with a Temporal Service lets you perform actions such as starting Workflow Executions, sending Signals and
Queries to Workflow Executions, getting Workflow results, and more.

This page shows you how to do the following using the Ruby SDK with the Temporal Client:

- [Connect to a local development Temporal Service](#connect-to-development-service)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](#start-workflow)
- [Get Workflow results](#get-workflow-results)

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow. However, it is acceptable and common to use a
Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Service.

## Connect to development Temporal Service {#connect-to-development-service}

Use [`Client.connect`](https://ruby.temporal.io/Temporalio/Client.html#connect-class_method) to create a client.
Connection options include the Temporal Server address, Namespace, and (optionally) TLS configuration. You can provide
these options directly in code, load them from **environment variables**, or a **TOML configuration file** using the
[`EnvConfig`](https://ruby.temporal.io/Temporalio/EnvConfig.html) helpers. We recommend environment variables or a
configuration file for secure, repeatable configuration.

When you’re running a Temporal Service locally (such as with the
[Temporal CLI dev server](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/server#start-dev)), the required options are minimal. If you
don't specify a host/port, most connections default to `127.0.0.1:7233` and the `default` Namespace.

<Tabs groupId="connect-options" defaultValue="config-file" >

<TabItem value="config-file" label="Configuration File">

You can use a TOML configuration file to set connection options for the Temporal Client. The configuration file lets you
configure multiple profiles, each with its own set of connection options. You can then specify which profile to use when
creating the Temporal Client. You can use the environment variable `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` to specify the location of the
TOML file or provide the path to the file directly in code. If you don't provide the configuration file path, the SDK
looks for it at the path `~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml` or the equivalent on your OS. Refer to
[Environment Configuration](/develop/environment-configuration.mdx#configuration-methods) for more details about configuration
files and profiles.

:::info

The connection options set in configuration files have lower precedence than environment variables. This means that if
you set the same option in both the configuration file and as an environment variable, the environment variable value
overrides the option set in the configuration file.

:::

For example, the following TOML configuration file defines two profiles: `default` and `prod`. Each profile has its own
set of connection options.

```toml title="config.toml"
# Default profile for local development
[profile.default]
address = "localhost:7233"
namespace = "default"

# Optional: Add custom gRPC headers
[profile.default.grpc_meta]
my-custom-header = "development-value"
trace-id = "dev-trace-123"

# Production profile for Temporal Cloud
[profile.prod]
address = "your-namespace.a1b2c.tmprl.cloud:7233"
namespace = "your-namespace"
api_key = "your-api-key-here"

# TLS configuration for production
[profile.prod.tls]
# TLS auto-enables when TLS config or an API key is present
# disabled = false
client_cert_path = "/etc/temporal/certs/client.pem"
client_key_path  = "/etc/temporal/certs/client.key"

# Custom headers for production
[profile.prod.grpc_meta]
environment     = "production"
service-version = "v1.2.3"
```

You can create a Temporal Client using a profile from the configuration file using the
`ClientConfig.load_client_connect_options` function as follows. In this example, you load the `default` profile for
local development:

```ruby
require 'temporalio/client'
require 'temporalio/env_config'

def main
  puts '--- Loading default profile from config.toml ---'

  # For this sample to be self-contained, we explicitly provide the path to
  # the config.toml file included in this directory.
  # By default though, the config.toml file will be loaded from
  # ~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml (or the equivalent standard config directory on your OS).
  config_file = File.join(__dir__, 'config.toml')

  # load_client_connect_options is a helper that loads a profile and prepares
  # the configuration for Client.connect. By default, it loads the
  # "default" profile.
  args, kwargs = Temporalio::EnvConfig::ClientConfig.load_client_connect_options(
    config_source: Pathname.new(config_file)
  )

  puts "Loaded 'default' profile from #{config_file}."
  puts "  Address: #{args[0]}"
  puts "  Namespace: #{args[1]}"
  puts "  gRPC Metadata: #{kwargs[:rpc_metadata]}"

  puts "\nAttempting to connect to client..."
  begin
    client = Temporalio::Client.connect(*args, **kwargs)
    puts '✅ Client connected successfully!'
    sys_info = client.workflow_service.get_system_info(Temporalio::Api::WorkflowService::V1::GetSystemInfoRequest.new)
    puts "✅ Successfully verified connection to Temporal server!\n#{sys_info}"
  rescue StandardError => e
    puts "❌ Failed to connect: #{e}"
  end
end

main if $PROGRAM_NAME == __FILE__
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="env-vars" label="Environment Variables">

Use the `EnvConfig` package to set connection options for the Temporal Client using environment variables. For a list of
all available environment variables and their default values, refer to
[Environment Configuration](/references/client-environment-configuration).

For example, the following code snippet loads all environment variables and creates a Temporal Client with the options
specified in those variables. If you have defined a configuration file at either the default location
(`~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml`) or a custom location specified by the `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` environment
variable, this will also load the default profile in the configuration file. However, any options set via environment
variables will take precedence.

Set the following environment variables before running your application. Replace the placeholder values with your actual
configuration. Since this is for a local development Temporal Service, the values connect to `localhost:7233` and the
`default` Namespace. You may omit these variables entirely since they're the defaults.

```bash
export TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE="default"
export TEMPORAL_ADDRESS="localhost:7233"
```

After setting the environment variables, you can create a Temporal Client as follows:

```ruby {9}
require 'temporalio/client'
require 'temporalio/env_config'

def main
  # load_client_connect_options is a helper that loads a profile and prepares
  # the configuration for Client.connect. By default, it loads the
  # "default" profile and also reads from environment variables. The environment
  # variables take precedence over the config file.
  args, kwargs = Temporalio::EnvConfig::ClientConfig.load_client_connect_options()

  puts "  Address: #{args[0]}"
  puts "  Namespace: #{args[1]}"
  puts "  gRPC Metadata: #{kwargs[:rpc_metadata]}"

  puts "\nAttempting to connect to client..."
  begin
    client = Temporalio::Client.connect(*args, **kwargs)
    puts '✅ Client connected successfully!'
    sys_info = client.workflow_service.get_system_info(Temporalio::Api::WorkflowService::V1::GetSystemInfoRequest.new)
    puts "✅ Successfully verified connection to Temporal server!\n#{sys_info}"
  rescue StandardError => e
    puts "❌ Failed to connect: #{e}"
  end
end

main if $PROGRAM_NAME == __FILE__
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="code" label="Code">

If you don't want to use environment variables or a configuration file, you can specify connection options directly in
code. This is convenient for local development and testing. You can also load a base configuration from environment
variables or a configuration file, and then override specific options in code.

Use the `connect` class method on the `Temporalio::Client` class to create and connect to a Temporal Client to the
Temporal Service.

```ruby
client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'default')
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Connect to Temporal Cloud {#connect-to-temporal-cloud}

You can connect to Temporal Cloud using either an [API key](/cloud/api-keys) or through mTLS. Connection to Temporal
Cloud or any secured Temporal Service requires additional connection options compared to connecting to an unsecured
local development instance:

- Your credentials for authentication.
  - If you are using an API key, provide the API key value.
  - If you are using mTLS, provide the mTLS CA certificate and mTLS private key.
- Your _Namespace and Account ID_ combination, which follows the format `<namespace_id>.<account_id>`.
- The _endpoint_ may vary. The most common endpoint used is the gRPC regional endpoint, which follows the format:
  `<region>.<cloud_provider>.api.temporal.io:7233`.
- For Namespaces with High Availability features with API key authentication enabled, use the gRPC Namespace endpoint:
  `<namespace>.<account>.tmprl.cloud:7233`. This allows automated failover without needing to switch endpoints.

You can find the Namespace and Account ID, as well as the endpoint, on the Namespaces tab:

![The Namespace and Account ID combination on the left, and the regional endpoint on the right](/img/cloud/apikeys/namespaces-and-regional-endpoints.png)

You can provide these connection options using environment variables, a configuration file, or directly in code.

<Tabs groupId="connect-api-key-options" defaultValue="config-file" >

<TabItem value="config-file" label="Configuration File">

You can use a TOML configuration file to set connection options for the Temporal Client. The configuration file lets you
configure multiple profiles, each with its own set of connection options. You can then specify which profile to use when
creating the Temporal Client. For a list of all available configuration options you can set in the TOML file, refer to
[Environment Configuration](/references/client-environment-configuration).

You can use the environment variable `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` to specify the location of the TOML file or provide the path
to the file directly in code. If you don't provide the path to the configuration file, the SDK looks for it at the
default path `~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml`.

:::info

The connection options set in configuration files have lower precedence than environment variables. This means that if
you set the same option in both the configuration file and as an environment variable, the environment variable value
overrides the option set in the configuration file.

:::

For example, the following TOML configuration file defines a `staging` profile with the necessary connection options to
connect to Temporal Cloud via an API key:

For example, the following TOML configuration file defines a `staging` profile with the necessary connection options to
connect to Temporal Cloud via an API key:

```toml
# Cloud profile for Temporal Cloud
[profile.staging]
address = "your-namespace.a1b2c.tmprl.cloud:7233"
namespace = "your-namespace"
api_key = "your-api-key-here"
```

If you want to use mTLS authentication instead of an API key, replace the `api_key` field with your mTLS certificate and
private key:

```toml
# Cloud profile for Temporal Cloud
[profile.staging]
address = "your-namespace.a1b2c.tmprl.cloud:7233"
namespace = "your-namespace"
tls_client_cert_data = "your-tls-client-cert-data"
tls_client_key_path = "your-tls-client-key-path"
```

With the connections options defined in the configuration file, use the
[`Client.connect` method](https://ruby.temporal.io/Temporalio/Client.html#connect-class_method) to create a Temporal
Client using the `staging` profile as follows. After loading the profile, you can also programmatically override
specific connection options before creating the client.

```ruby {8,14-16}
require 'temporalio/client'
require 'temporalio/env_config'

def main
  puts "--- Loading 'staging' profile with programmatic overrides ---"

  config_file = File.join(__dir__, 'config.toml')
  profile_name = 'staging'

  puts "The 'staging' profile in config.toml has an incorrect address (localhost:9999)."
  puts "We'll programmatically override it to the correct address."

  # Load the 'staging' profile.
  args, kwargs = Temporalio::EnvConfig::ClientConfig.load_client_connect_options(
    profile: profile_name,
    config_source: Pathname.new(config_file)
  )

  # Override the target host to the correct address.
  # This is the recommended way to override configuration values.
  args[0] = 'localhost:7233'

  puts "\nLoaded '#{profile_name}' profile from #{config_file} with overrides."
  puts "  Address: #{args[0]} (overridden from localhost:9999)"
  puts "  Namespace: #{args[1]}"

  puts "\nAttempting to connect to client..."
  begin
    client = Temporalio::Client.connect(*args, **kwargs)
    puts '✅ Client connected successfully!'
    sys_info = client.workflow_service.get_system_info(Temporalio::Api::WorkflowService::V1::GetSystemInfoRequest.new)
    puts "✅ Successfully verified connection to Temporal server!\n#{sys_info}"
  rescue StandardError => e
    puts "❌ Failed to connect: #{e}"
  end
end

main if $PROGRAM_NAME == __FILE__
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="env-vars" label="Environment Variables">

The following environment variables are required to connect to Temporal Cloud:

- `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE`: Your Namespace and Account ID combination in the format `<namespace_id>.<account_id>`.
- `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`: The gRPC endpoint for your Temporal Cloud Namespace.
- `TEMPORAL_API_KEY`: Your API key value. Required if you are using API key authentication.
- `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_DATA` or `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`: Your mTLS client certificate data or file path.
  Required if you are using mTLS authentication.
- `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_DATA` or `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`: Your mTLS client private key data or file path.
  Required if you are using mTLS authentication.

Ensure these environment variables exist in your environment before running your application.

Import the `EnvConfig` package to set connection options for the Temporal Client using environment variables. The
`MustLoadDefaultClientOptions` function will automatically load all environment variables. For a list of all available
environment variables and their default values, refer to
[Environment Configuration](/references/client-environment-configuration).

For example, the following code snippet loads all environment variables and creates a Temporal Client with the options
specified in those variables. If you have defined a configuration file at either the default location
(`~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml`) or a custom location specified by the `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` environment
variable, this will also load the default profile in the configuration file. However, any options set via environment
variables will take precedence.

After setting the environment variables, use the following code to create the Temporal Client:

```ruby {9, 17}
require 'temporalio/client'
require 'temporalio/env_config'

def main
  # load_client_connect_options is a helper that loads a profile and prepares
  # the configuration for Client.connect. By default, it loads the
  # "default" profile. It also reads from environment variables. The environment
  # variables take precedence over the config file.
  args, kwargs = Temporalio::EnvConfig::ClientConfig.load_client_connect_options()

  puts "  Address: #{args[0]}"
  puts "  Namespace: #{args[1]}"
  puts "  gRPC Metadata: #{kwargs[:rpc_metadata]}"

  puts "\nAttempting to connect to client..."
  begin
    client = Temporalio::Client.connect(*args, **kwargs)
    puts '✅ Client connected successfully!'
    sys_info = client.workflow_service.get_system_info(Temporalio::Api::WorkflowService::V1::GetSystemInfoRequest.new)
    puts "✅ Successfully verified connection to Temporal server!\n#{sys_info}"
  rescue StandardError => e
    puts "❌ Failed to connect: #{e}"
  end
end

main if $PROGRAM_NAME == __FILE__
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="code" label="Code">

You can also specify connection options directly in code to connect to Temporal Cloud. To create an initial connection,
provide the endpoint, Namespace and Account ID combination, and API key values to the `Client.connect` method.

```ruby
client = Temporalio::Client.connect(
  '<endpoint>', # Endpoint
  '<namespace_id>.<account_id>', # Namespace
  api_key: '<api_key>',
  tls: true
)
```

To connect using mTLS instead of an API key, provide the mTLS certificate and private key as follows:

```ruby
client = Temporalio::Client.connect(
  '<endpoint>', # Endpoint
  '<namespace_id>.<account_id>', # Namespace
  tls: Temporalio::Client::Connection::TLSOptions.new(
    client_cert: File.read('my-client-cert.pem'),
    client_private_key: File.read('my-client-key.pem')
  )
)
```

## Start a Workflow {#start-workflow}

To start a Workflow Execution, supply:

- A Task Queue
- A Workflow Type
- Input arguments
- Workflow options such as Workflow Id

To start a Workflow Execution in Ruby, use either the `start_workflow` or `execute_workflow` methods in the Client. You
must set a [Workflow Id](/workflow-execution/workflowid-runid#workflow-id) and [Task Queue](/task-queue) in the
parameters given to the method.

```ruby
result = my_client.execute_workflow(
  MyWorkflow, 'some-input',
  id: 'my-workflow-id', task_queue: 'my-task-queue'
)
puts "Result: #{result}"
```

## Get Workflow results {#get-workflow-results}

Once a Workflow Execution is started, the Workflow Id and Run Id can be used to uniquely identify it.

You can block until the result is available, or retrieve it later using the handle.

You can also use Queries to access Workflow state and results while the Workflow is running.

Use `start_workflow` or `workflow_handle` on the Client to return a Workflow handle. Then use the `result` method to
await on the result of the Workflow.

```ruby
handle = my_client.workflow_handle('my-workflow-id')
result = handle.result
puts "Result: #{result}"
```
