## Develop a Workflow {#develop-workflow}

Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a [Workflow Definition](/workflow-definition).

In the Temporal Ruby SDK programming model, Workflows are defined as classes.

Have the Workflow class extend `Temporalio::Workflow::Definition` to define a Workflow.

The entrypoint is the `execute` method.

```ruby
class MyWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute(name)
    Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
      MyActivity,
      { greeting: 'Hello', name: },
      start_to_close_timeout: 100
    )
  end
end
```

Temporal Workflows may have any number of custom parameters.
However, we strongly recommend that hashes or objects are used as parameters, so that the object's individual fields may be altered without breaking the signature of the Workflow.

### Workflow Logic Requirements {#workflow-logic-requirements}

Temporal Workflows [must be deterministic](https://docs.temporal.io/workflows#deterministic-constraints), which includes
Ruby workflows. This means there are several things workflows cannot do such as:

- Perform IO (network, disk, stdio, etc)
- Access/alter external mutable state
- Do any threading
- Do anything using the system clock (e.g. `Time.Now`)
- Make any random calls
- Make any not-guaranteed-deterministic calls

To prevent illegal workflow calls, a call tracer is put on the workflow thread that raises an exception if any illegal
calls are made.
Which calls are illegal is configurable in the worker options.

### Customize Workflow Type {#workflow-type}

Workflows have a Type that are referred to as the Workflow name.

The following examples demonstrate how to set a custom name for your Workflow Type.

You can customize the Workflow name with a custom name in a `workflow_name` class method call on the class.
The Workflow name defaults to the unqualified class name.

```ruby
class MyWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  # Customize the name
  workflow_name :MyDifferentWorkflowName

  def execute(name)
    Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
      MyActivity,
      { greeting: 'Hello', name: },
      start_to_close_timeout: 100
    )
  end
end
```

## Develop an Activity {#develop-activity}

One of the primary things that Workflows do is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
An Activity is a normal method execution that's intended to execute a single, well-defined action (either short or long-running), such as querying a database, calling a third-party API, or transcoding a media file.
An Activity can interact with world outside the Temporal Platform or use a Temporal Client to interact with a Temporal Service.
For the Workflow to be able to execute the Activity, we must define the [Activity Definition](/activity-definition).

You can develop an Activity Definition by creating a class that extends `Temporalio::Activity::Definition`.
To register a class as an Activity with a custom name, use the `activity_name` class method in the class definition.
Otherwise, the activity name is the unqualified class name.

```ruby
class MyActivity < Temporalio::Activity::Definition
  def execute(input)
    "#{input['greeting']}, #{input['name']}!"
  end
end
```

Activity implementation code should be _idempotent_. Learn more about [idempotency](/activity-definition#idempotency).

There is no explicit limit to the total number of parameters that an [Activity Definition](/activity-definition) may support.
However, there is a limit to the total size of the data that ends up encoded into a gRPC message Payload.

A single argument is limited to a maximum size of 2 MB.
And the total size of a gRPC message, which includes all the arguments, is limited to a maximum of 4 MB.

Some SDKs require that you pass context objects, others do not.
When it comes to your application data—that is, data that is serialized and encoded into a Payload—we recommend that you use a single hash or object as an argument that wraps the application data passed to Activities.
This is so that you can change what data is passed to the Activity without breaking a method signature.

The `execute` method in your Activity can technically accept multiple parameters of any data type that Temporal can convert.
However, Temporal strongly encourages using a single parameter object to simplify versioning and maintainability.

### Activity Concurrency and Executors {#activity-concurrency-and-executors}

:::note

This section covers advanced concurrency and execution options that most users will not need when getting started.

:::

By default, activities run in the "thread pool executor" (i.e. `Temporalio::Worker::ActivityExecutor::ThreadPool`).
This default is shared across all workers and is a naive thread pool that continually makes threads as needed when none are
idle/available to handle incoming work.
If a thread sits idle long enough, it will be killed.

The maximum number of concurrent activities a worker will run at a time is configured via its `tuner` option.
The default is `Temporalio::Worker::Tuner.create_fixed` which defaults to 100 activities at a time for that worker.
When this value is reached, the worker will stop asking for work from the server until there are slots available again.

In addition to the thread pool executor, there is also a fiber executor in the default executor set.
To use fibers, call `activity_executor :fiber` class method at the top of the activity class (the default of this value is `:default` which is the thread pool executor).
Activities can only choose the fiber executor if the worker has been created and run in a fiber, but thread pool executor is always available.
Currently due to [an issue](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/162), workers can only run in a fiber on Ruby versions 3.3 and newer.

## Start Activity Execution {#activity-execution}

Calls to spawn [Activity Executions](/activity-execution) are written within a [Workflow Definition](/workflow-definition).
The call to spawn an Activity Execution generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands#scheduleactivitytask) Command.
This results in the set of three [Activity Task](/tasks#activity-task) related Events ([ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events#activitytaskscheduled), [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events#activitytaskstarted), and `ActivityTask[Closed]`)in your Workflow Execution Event History.

The values passed to Activities through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the Execution history.
The entire Execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow Workers when a Workflow state needs to recover.
A large Execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.

Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data you transfer through Activity invocation parameters or Return Values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.

To spawn an Activity Execution, use the `execute_activity` operation from within your Workflow Definition.

```ruby
class MyWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  # Customize the name
  workflow_name :MyDifferentWorkflowName

  def execute(name)
    Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
      MyActivity,
      { greeting: 'Hello', name: },
      start_to_close_timeout: 100
    )
  end
end
```

Activity Execution semantics rely on several parameters.
The only required value that needs to be set is either a [Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-close-timeout) or a [Start-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout).
These values are set as keyword parameters.

The Activity result is the returned from the `execute_activity` call.

## Workflow Futures {#workflow-futures}

`Temporalio::Workflow::Future` can be used for running things in the background or concurrently.
Temporal provides Workflow-safe wrappers around some core language features in cases like these.
`Temporalio::Workflow::Future` is a safe wrapper around `Fiber.schedule` for running multiple Activities at once.
The Ruby SDK also provides `Workflow.wait_condition` for awaiting a result.

Futures are never used implicitly, but they work with all Workflow code and constructs.
For instance, to run 3 activities and wait for them all to complete, something like this can be written:

```ruby
# Start 3 activities in background
fut1 = Temporalio::Workflow::Future.new do
  Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(MyActivity1, schedule_to_close_timeout: 300)
end
fut2 = Temporalio::Workflow::Future.new do
  Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(MyActivity2, schedule_to_close_timeout: 300)
end
fut3 = Temporalio::Workflow::Future.new do
  Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(MyActivity3, schedule_to_close_timeout: 300)
end

# Wait for them all to complete
Temporalio::Workflow::Future.all_of(fut1, fut2, fut3).wait

Temporalio::Workflow.logger.info("Got: #{fut1.result}, #{fut2.result}, #{fut3.result}")
```

Or, say, to wait on the first of 5 activities or a timeout to complete:

```ruby
# Start 5 activities
act_futs = 5.times.map do |i|
  Temporalio::Workflow::Future.new do
    Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(MyActivity, "my-arg-#{i}", schedule_to_close_timeout: 300)
  end
end
# Start a timer
sleep_fut = Temporalio::Workflow::Future.new { Temporalio::Workflow.sleep(30) }

# Wait for first act result or sleep fut
act_result = Temporalio::Workflow::Future.any_of(sleep_fut, *act_futs).wait
# Fail if timer done first
raise Temporalio::Error::ApplicationError, 'Timer expired' if sleep_fut.done?
# Print act result otherwise
Temporalio::Workflow.logger.info("Act result: #{act_result}")
```

There are several other details not covered here about futures, such as how exceptions are handled, how to use a setter
proc instead of a block, etc. See the [API documentation](https://ruby.temporal.io/Temporalio/Workflow/Future.html) for details.

## Run Worker Process {#run-worker-process}

The [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) is where Workflow Functions and Activity Functions are actually executed.
In a Temporal application deployment, you ship and scale as many Workers as you need to handle the load of your Workflows and Activities.

- Each [Worker Entity](/workers#worker-entity) in the Worker Process must register the exact Workflow Types and Activity Types it may execute.
- Each Worker Entity must also associate itself with exactly one [Task Queue](/task-queue).
- Each Worker Entity polling the same Task Queue must be registered with the same Workflow Types and Activity Types.

A [Worker Entity](/workers#worker-entity) is the component within a Worker Process that listens to a specific Task Queue.

A Worker Entity contains a Workflow Worker and/or an Activity Worker, which makes progress on Workflow Executions and Activity Executions, respectively.

Workers are implemented in each Temporal SDK, and can be deployed with just a bit of boilerplate.
To create a Worker, use `Temporalio::Worker.new()`, providing the Worker options which include Task Queue, Workflows, and Activities and more.

The following code example creates a Worker that polls for tasks from the Task Queue and executes the Workflow.
When a Worker is created, it accepts a list of Workflows, a list of Activities, or both.

```ruby
# Create a client to localhost on default namespace
client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'default')

# Create a worker with the client, activities, and workflows
worker = Temporalio::Worker.new(
  client:,
  task_queue: 'my-task-queue',
  workflows: [MyWorkflow],
  # This provides the activity instance which means it is reused for each attempt, but
  # just the class can be provided to instantiate for each attempt
  activities: [MyActivity.new]
)

# Run the worker until SIGINT. There are other ways to wait for shutdown, or a block can
# be provided that will shutdown when the block completes
worker.run(shutdown_signals: ['SIGINT'])
```

To run multiple workers, `Temporalio::Worker.run_all` may be used instead.

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it fails that Task.
However, the failure of the Task does not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

## Set a Dynamic Workflow {#set-a-dynamic-workflow}

A Dynamic Workflow in Temporal is a Workflow that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Workflow with the same name is registered.
A Workflow can be made dynamic by invoking `workflow_dynamic` class method at the top of the definition.
You must register the Workflow with the Worker before it can be invoked.
Only one Dynamic Workflow can be present on a Worker.

Often, dynamic is used in conjunction with `workflow_raw_args` which does not convert arguments but instead passes them
through as a splatted array of `Temporalio::Converters::RawValue` instances.

```ruby
class MyDynamicWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  # Make this the dynamic workflow and accept raw args
  workflow_dynamic
  workflow_raw_args

  def execute(*raw_args)
    # Require a single arg for our workflow
    raise Temporalio::Error::ApplicationError, 'One arg expected' unless raw_args.size == 1

    # Use payload converter to convert it
    name = Temporalio::Workflow.payload_converter.from_payload(raw_args.first.payload)
    Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
      MyActivity,
      { greeting: 'Hello', name: },
      start_to_close_timeout: 100
    )
  end
end
```

## Set a Dynamic Activity {#set-a-dynamic-activity}

A Dynamic Activity in Temporal is an Activity that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Activity with the same name is registered.
An Activity can be made dynamic by invoking `activity_dynamic` class method at the top of the definition.
You must register the Activity with the Worker before it can be invoked.
Only one Dynamic Activity can be present on a Worker.

Often, dynamic is used in conjunction with `activity_raw_args` which does not convert arguments but instead passes them
through as a splatted array of `Temporalio::Converters::RawValue` instances.

```ruby
class MyDynamicActivity < Temporalio::Activity::Definition
  # Make this the dynamic activity and accept raw args
  activity_dynamic
  activity_raw_args

  def execute(*raw_args)
    raise Temporalio::Error::ApplicationError, 'One arg expected' unless raw_args.size == 1

    # Use payload converter to convert it
    input = Temporalio::Activity::Context.current.payload_converter.from_payload(raw_args.first.payload)
    "#{input['greeting']}, #{input['name']}!"
  end
end
```
