## Debugging {#debug}

This page shows how to do the following:

- [Debug in a development environment](#debug-in-a-development-environment)
- [Debug in a development production](#debug-in-a-development-production)

### Debug in a development environment {#debug-in-a-development-environment}

In developing Workflows, you can use the normal development tools of logging and a debugger to see what’s happening in your Workflow.
In addition to the normal development tools of logging and a debugger, you can also see what’s happening in your Workflow by using the [Web UI](/web-ui) or [Temporal CLI](/cli).
The Web UI provides insight into your Workflows, making it easier to identify issues and monitor the state of your Workflows in real time.

### Debug in a development production {#debug-in-a-development-production}

You can debug production Workflows using:

- [Web UI](/web-ui)
- [Temporal CLI](/cli)
- [Replay](/develop/dotnet/testing-suite#replay-test)
- [Tracing](/develop/dotnet/observability#tracing)
- [Logging](/develop/dotnet/observability#logging)

You can debug and tune Worker performance with metrics and the [Worker performance guide](/develop/worker-performance).
For more information, see [Observability ▶️ Metrics](/develop/dotnet/observability#metrics) for setting up SDK metrics.

Debug Server performance with [Cloud metrics](/cloud/metrics/) or [self-hosted Server metrics](/self-hosted-guide/production-checklist#scaling-and-metrics).
