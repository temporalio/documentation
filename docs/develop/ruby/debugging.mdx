## Debugging {#debug}

This page shows how to do the following:

- [Debug in a development environment](#debug-in-a-development-environment)
- [Debug in a development production](#debug-in-a-development-environment)

## Debug in a development environment {#debug-in-a-development-environment}

In developing Workflows, you can use the normal development tools of logging and a debugger to see what’s happening in your Workflow.

In addition to the normal development tools of logging and a debugger, you can also see what’s happening in your Workflow by using the [Web UI](/web-ui) or [Temporal CLI](/cli).
The Web UI provides insight into your Workflows, making it easier to identify issues and monitor the state of your Workflows in real time.

## Debug in a production environment {#debug-in-a-production-environment}

For production Workflows, debugging options include:

- [Web UI](/web-ui)
- [Temporal CLI](/cli)
- [Replay](/develop/ruby/testing-suite#replay-test)
- [Tracing](/develop/ruby/observability#tracing)
- [Logging](/develop/ruby/observability#logging)

You can analyze Worker performance using:

- [Metrics](/develop/ruby/observability#metrics)
- [Worker performance guide](/develop/worker-performance)

To monitor Server performance:

- Use [Cloud metrics](/cloud/metrics/) if you're on Temporal Cloud
- Or [self-hosted Server metrics](/self-hosted-guide/production-checklist#scaling-and-metrics) if running your own deployment
