# Enriching the User Interface

Enhance the Temporal UI by adding contextual information to workflows and events. This makes it easier to identify and understand workflows and their operations at a glance.

## Adding Summary and Details to Workflows

#### Starting a Workflow

When starting a workflow, you can provide a static summary and details to help identify the workflow in the UI:

```ruby
require 'temporalio/client'

# Create client
client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233')

# Start a workflow with static summary and details
handle = client.start_workflow(
  'YourWorkflow',
  'workflow input',
  id: 'your-workflow-id',
  task_queue: 'your-task-queue',
  static_summary: 'Order processing for customer #12345',
  static_details: 'Processing premium order with expedited shipping'
)
```

`static_summary:` is a single-line description that appears in the workflow list view, limited to 200 bytes.
`static_details:` can be multi-line and provides more comprehensive information that appears in the workflow details view, with a larger limit of 20K bytes.

The input format is normal Markdown excluding: images, html, and scripts.

You can also use `execute_workflow` for synchronous execution:

```ruby
# Execute workflow synchronously
result = client.execute_workflow(
  'YourWorkflow',
  'workflow input',
  id: 'your-workflow-id',
  task_queue: 'your-task-queue',
  static_summary: 'Order processing for customer #12345',
  static_details: 'Processing premium order with expedited shipping'
)
```

#### Inside the Workflow

Within a workflow, you can get and set the _current workflow details_. Unlike static summary/details set at 
workflow start, this value can be updated throughout the life of the workflow. Current workflow details 
also takes Markdown format (again, excluding images, html, and scripts) and can span multiple lines.

```ruby
require 'temporalio'

class YourWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute(input)
    # Get the current details
    current_details = Temporalio::Workflow.current_details
    Temporalio::Workflow.logger.info("Current details: #{current_details}")
    
    # Set/update the current details
    Temporalio::Workflow.current_details = 'Updated workflow details with new status'
    
    'Workflow completed'
  end
end
```

#### Adding Summary to Activities and Timers

You can attach a `summary:` to activities when starting them from within a workflow:

```ruby
require 'temporalio'

class YourWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute(input)
    # Execute an activity with a summary
    result = Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
      'YourActivity',
      input,
      start_to_close_timeout: 10,
      summary: 'Processing user data'
    )
    
    result
  end
end
```

Similarly, you can attach a `summary:` to timers within a workflow:

```ruby
require 'temporalio'

class YourWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute(input)
    # Create a timer with a summary
    Temporalio::Workflow.sleep(300, summary: 'Waiting for payment confirmation')
    
    'Timer completed'
  end
end
```

The input format for `summary:` is a string, and limited to 200 bytes.
