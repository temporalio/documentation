Temporal supports adding context to Workflows and Events with metadata. 
This helps users identify and understand Workflows and their operations.

## Adding Summary and Details to Workflows

### Starting a Workflow

When starting a Workflow, you can provide a static summary and details to help identify the Workflow in the UI:

```ruby
require 'temporalio/client'

# Create client
client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233')

# Start a workflow with static summary and details
handle = client.start_workflow(
  'YourWorkflow',
  'workflow input',
  id: 'your-workflow-id',
  task_queue: 'your-task-queue',
  static_summary: 'Order processing for customer #12345',
  static_details: 'Processing premium order with expedited shipping'
)
```

`static_summary:` is a single-line description that appears in the Workflow list view, limited to 200 bytes.
`static_details:` can be multi-line and provides more comprehensive information that appears in the Workflow details view, with a larger limit of 20K bytes.

The input format is standard Markdown excluding images, HTML, and scripts.

You can also use `execute_workflow` for synchronous execution:

```ruby
# Execute workflow synchronously
result = client.execute_workflow(
  'YourWorkflow',
  'workflow input',
  id: 'your-workflow-id',
  task_queue: 'your-task-queue',
  static_summary: 'Order processing for customer #12345',
  static_details: 'Processing premium order with expedited shipping'
)
```

#### Inside the Workflow

Within a Workflow, you can get and set the _current workflow details_. 
Unlike static summary/details set at Workflow start, this value can be updated throughout the life of the Workflow. 
Current Workflow details also takes Markdown format (excluding images, HTML, and scripts) and can span multiple lines.

```ruby
require 'temporalio'

class YourWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute(input)
    # Get the current details
    current_details = Temporalio::Workflow.current_details
    Temporalio::Workflow.logger.info("Current details: #{current_details}")
    
    # Set/update the current details
    Temporalio::Workflow.current_details = 'Updated workflow details with new status'
    
    'Workflow completed'
  end
end
```

#### Adding Summary to Activities and Timers

You can attach a `summary:` to activities when starting them from within a Workflow:

```ruby
require 'temporalio'

class YourWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute(input)
    # Execute an activity with a summary
    result = Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
      'YourActivity',
      input,
      start_to_close_timeout: 10,
      summary: 'Processing user data'
    )
    
    result
  end
end
```

Similarly, you can attach a `summary:` to timers within a Workflow:

```ruby
require 'temporalio'

class YourWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute(input)
    # Create a timer with a summary
    Temporalio::Workflow.sleep(300, summary: 'Waiting for payment confirmation')
    
    'Timer completed'
  end
end
```

The input format for `summary:` is a string, and limited to 200 bytes.

## Viewing Summary and Details in the UI

Once you've added summaries and details to your Workflows, Activities, and Timers, you can view this enriched information in the Temporal Web UI. 
Navigate to your Workflow's details page to see the metadata displayed in two key locations:

### Workflow Overview Section

At the top of the workflow details page, you'll find the workflow-level metadata:

- **Summary & Details** - Displays the static summary and static details set when starting the workflow
- **Current Details** - Displays the dynamic details that can be updated during workflow execution

All Workflow details support standard Markdown formatting (excluding images, HTML, and scripts), allowing you to create rich, structured information displays.

### Event History

Individual events in the Workflow's Event History display their associated summaries when available:

Workflow, Activity and Timer summaries appear in purple text next to their corresponding Events, providing immediate context without requiring you to expand the event details. When you do expand an event, the summary is also prominently displayed in the detailed view.
