This page shows how to do the following:

- [Workflow timeouts](#workflow-timeouts)
- [Workflow retries](#workflow-retries)
- [Activity timeouts](#activity-timeouts)
- [Activity Retry Policy](#activity-retries)
- [Heartbeat an Activity](#activity-heartbeats)
- [Heartbeat Timeout](#heartbeat-timeout)

## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-execution-timeout)**: Limits how long the full Workflow Execution can run.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-run-timeout)**: Limits the duration of an individual run of a Workflow Execution.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-task-timeout)**: Limits the time allowed for a Worker to process a Workflow Task.

Set these values as keyword parameter options when starting a Workflow.

```ruby
result = my_client.execute_workflow(
  MyWorkflow, 'some-input',
  id: 'my-workflow-id', task_queue: 'my-task-queue',
  execution_timeout: 5 * 60
)
```

### Workflow retries {#workflow-retries}

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) to automatically retry Workflow Executions on failure.
Workflow Executions do not retry by default.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

The `retry_policy` can be set when calling `start_workflow` or `execute_workflow`.

```ruby
result = my_client.execute_workflow(
  MyWorkflow, 'some-input',
  id: 'my-workflow-id', task_queue: 'my-task-queue',
  retry_policy: Temporalio::RetryPolicy.new(max_interval: 10)
)
```

## Activity timeouts {#activity-timeouts}

Each Activity Timeout controls a different aspect of how long an Activity Execution can take:

- **[Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-close-timeout)**
- **[Start-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout)**
- **[Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-start-timeout)**

At least one of `start_to_close_timeout` or `schedule_to_close_timeout` is required.

```ruby
Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
  MyActivity,
  { greeting: 'Hello', name: },
  start_to_close_timeout: 5 * 60
)
```

### Activity Retry Policy {#activity-retries}

By default, Activities use a system Retry Policy.
You can override it by specifying a custom Retry Policy.

To create an Activity Retry Policy in Ruby, set the `retry_policy` parameter when executing an activity.

```ruby
Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
  MyActivity,
  { greeting: 'Hello', name: },
  start_to_close_timeout: 5 * 60,
  retry_policy: Temporalio::RetryPolicy.new(max_interval: 10)
)
```

### Override the retry interval with `next_retry_delay` {#next-retry-delay}

If you raise an application-level error, you can override the Retry Policy's delay by specifying a new delay.

```ruby
raise Temporalio::ApplicationError.new(
  'Some error',
  type: 'SomeErrorType',
  next_retry_delay: 3 * Temporalio::Activity::Context.current.info.attempt
)
```

## Heartbeat an Activity {#activity-heartbeats}

A Heartbeat is a periodic signal from the Worker to the Temporal Service indicating the Activity is still alive and making progress.

- Heartbeats are used to detect Worker failure.
- Cancellations are delivered via Heartbeats.
- Heartbeats may contain custom progress details.

```ruby
class MyActivity < Temporalio::Activity::Definition
  def execute
    # This is a naive loop simulating work, but similar heartbeat logic
    # applies to other scenarios as well
    loop do
      # Send heartbeat
      Temporalio::Activity::Context.current.heartbeat
      # Sleep before heartbeating again
      sleep(3)
    end
  end
end
```

### Heartbeat Timeout {#heartbeat-timeout}

The Heartbeat Timeout sets the maximum duration between Heartbeats before the Temporal Service considers the Activity failed.

```ruby
Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
  MyActivity,
  { greeting: 'Hello', name: },
  start_to_close_timeout: 5 * 60,
  heartbeat_timeout: 5
)
```
