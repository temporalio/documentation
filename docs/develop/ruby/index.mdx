## [Core Application](/develop/ruby/core-application)

Use the essential components of a Temporal Application (Workflows, Activities, and Workers) to build and run a Temporal application.

- [Develop a basic Workflow Definition](/develop/ruby/core-application#develop-workflow): Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a Workflow Definition.
- [Develop a basic Activity Definition](/develop/ruby/core-application#develop-activity): One of the primary things that Workflows do is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
- [Start an Activity from a Workflow](/develop/ruby/core-application#activity-execution): Calls to spawn Activity Executions are written within a Workflow Definition.
- [Run a Worker Process](/develop/ruby/core-application#run-worker-process): The Worker Process is where Workflow Functions and Activity Functions are executed.
- [Set a Dynamic Workflow](/develop/ruby/core-application#set-a-dynamic-workflow): Set a Workflow that can be invoked dynamically at runtime.
- [Set a Dynamic Activity](/develop/ruby/core-application#set-a-dynamic-activity): Set an Activity that can be invoked dynamically at runtime.

## [Temporal Client](/develop/ruby/temporal-client)

Connect to a Temporal Service and start a Workflow Execution.

## [Testing](/develop/ruby/testing-suite)

Set up the testing suite and test Workflows and Activities.

- [Test frameworks](/develop/ruby/testing-suite#test-frameworks): Testing provides a framework to facilitate Workflow and integration testing.
- [Testing Workflows](/develop/ruby/testing-suite#testing-workflows): Ensure the functionality and reliability of your Workflows.

- [Replay test](/develop/ruby/testing-suite#replay-test): Replay recreates the exact state of a Workflow Execution.

## [Failure detection](/develop/ruby/failure-detection)

Explore how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

- [Workflow timeouts](/develop/ruby/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts): Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.
- [Workflow retries](/develop/ruby/failure-detection#workflow-retries): A Workflow Retry Policy can be used to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.
- [Activity timeouts](/develop/ruby/failure-detection#activity-timeouts): Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.
- [Set an Activity Retry Policy](/develop/ruby/failure-detection#activity-retries): Define retry logic for Activities to handle failures.
- [Heartbeat an Activity](/develop/ruby/failure-detection#activity-heartbeats): An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Service.
- [Heartbeat Timeout](/develop/ruby/failure-detection#heartbeat-timeout): A Heartbeat Timeout works in conjunction with Activity Heartbeats.

## [Workflow message passing](/develop/go/message-passing)

- [Signal-With-Start](/develop/ruby/message-passing#signal-with-start): Start a Workflow and send it a Signal in a single operation used from the Client.
- [Dynamic Handler](/develop/ruby/message-passing#dynamic-handler): Dynamic Handlers provide flexibility to handle cases where the names of Workflows, Activities, Signals, or Queries aren't known at run time.
- [Set a Dynamic Signal](/develop/ruby/message-passing#set-a-dynamic-signal): A Dynamic Signal in Temporal is a Signal that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Signal with the same input is registered.

### Queries

- [Define a Query](/develop/ruby/message-passing#queries): A Query is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.
- [Send Queries](/develop/ruby/message-passing#send-query): Queries are sent from the Temporal Client.
- [Set a Dynamic Query](/develop/ruby/message-passing#set-a-dynamic-signal): A Dynamic Query in Temporal is a Query that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Query with the same name is registered.

### Updates

- [Define an Update](/develop/ruby/message-passing#updates): An Update is an operation that can mutate the state of a Workflow Execution and return a response.
- [Send an Update](/develop/ruby/message-passing#send-update-from-client): An Update is sent from the Temporal Client.

## [Interrupt a Workflow](/develop/ruby/interrupt-workflow)

Interrupt a Workflow Execution with a Cancel or Terminate action.

- [Cancel a Workflow](/develop/ruby/interrupt-workflow#cancellation): Interrupt a Workflow Execution and its Activities through Workflow cancellation.
- [Terminate a Workflow](/develop/ruby/interrupt-workflow#termination): Interrupt a Workflow Execution and its Activities through Workflow termination.

## [Asynchronous Activity completion](/develop/ruby/asynchronous-activity)

Complete Activities asynchronously.

- [Asynchronous Activity](/develop/ruby/asynchronous-activity): Asynchronous Activity completion enables the Activity Function to return without the Activity Execution completing.

## [Versioning](/develop/ruby/versioning)

Change Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in running Workflows.

- [Use the Ruby SDK Patching API](/develop/ruby/versioning#ruby-sdk-patching-api): Patching Workflows using the Ruby SDK.

## [Observability](/develop/ruby/observability)

Configure and use the Temporal Observability APIs.
