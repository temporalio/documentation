This guide walks you through setting up the Temporal Ruby SDK and running your first Workflow.
In just a few steps, you'll install the SDK and start a local development server.
To validate that your local environment is correctly installed, we will execute a Workflow that will output "Hello, Temporal".

## 1. Installation

Install the Temporal SDK using your preferred method.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="gemfile" label="Gemfile">

```ruby
gem 'temporalio'
```

This approach is used in Ruby projects that manage dependencies with Bundler.

To install it, add the line to your project's Gemfile and run `bundle install` in your terminal.
Bundler will download and install the gem and its dependencies.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Command Line (gem install)">

```bash
gem install temporalio
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Both methods will install the same Temporal SDK, which supports Ruby versions 3.2+.

> **Note:**
>
> - Only macOS ARM/x64 and Linux ARM/x64 are supported.
> - Source gem is published but **cannot be built directly**.
> - Windows (MinGW) is not supported.
> - `fibers`/`async` are only supported on Ruby **3.3+**.
> - See [Platform Support](#) for full details.

## 2. Start the Temporal Server Locally

With the SDK installed, youâ€™ll need a local Temporal Server to run your Workflows.
The easiest way to do this is with [**Temporal CLI**](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/cli/).

<Tabs groupId="os" queryString>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

You can install the latest version with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) using the following command:

```command
brew install temporal
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

To install Temporal CLI on Windows, download the version for your architecture:

- [Download Temporal CLI for Windows amd64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=amd64)
- [Download Temporal CLI for Windows arm64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=arm64)

Once you've downloaded the file, extract the downloaded archive and add the `temporal.exe` binary to your `PATH`.

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

To install Temporal CLI, download the version for your architecture:

- [Download Temporal CLI for Linux amd64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=amd64)
- [Download Temporal CLI for Linux arm64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=arm64)

Once you've downloaded the file, extract the downloaded archive and add the `temporal` binary to your `PATH` by copying it to a directory like `/usr/local/bin`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once installed, run the development server by opening up a new terminal window:

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

This will:

- Start a Temporal Service on `localhost:7233`
- Launch the Web UI on [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233)
- Create the default namespace
- Use an in-memory database (data is lost when you stop the server)

Leave this running in a separate terminal tab or window while you develop.
You'll be able to monitor your Workflows through the Web UI as they execute.

> **Optional:** To retain data between runs, use:
>
> ```bash
> temporal server start-dev --db-filename my_temporal.db
> ```

## 3. Write Your First Activity and Workflow

Now that you have the server running, it's time to create your first Temporal application.
In Temporal, you'll create two files: an Activity file labeled `say_hello_activity.rb` and a Workflow file labeled `say_hello_workflow.rb`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="activity" label="Activity (say_hello_activity.rb)">

```ruby
require 'temporalio/activity'

class SayHelloActivity < Temporalio::Activity::Definition
  def execute(name)
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end
end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="workflow" label="Workflow (say_hello_workflow.rb)">

```ruby
require 'temporalio/workflow'
require_relative 'say_hello_activity'

class SayHelloWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute(name)
    Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
      SayHelloActivity,
      name,
      schedule_to_close_timeout: 300
    )
  end
end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

A Temporal Workflow is your business logic, defined in code, outlining each step in your process.
Activities are the individual units of work in your Workflow.
Activities often involve interacting with the outside world, such as sending emails, making network requests, writing to a database, or calling an API, which are prone to failure.
You can call Activities directly from your Workflow code.
If an Activity fails, Temporal automatically retries it based on your configuration.

## 4. Run a Worker

With your Activity and Workflow defined, you need a Worker to execute them.
Create a file labeled `worker.rb`.\
Workers, which are part of your application and provided by the Temporal SDK, then carry out the tasks defined in your Workflow.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="worker" label="Worker (worker.rb)">

```ruby
require 'temporalio/client'
require 'temporalio/worker'
require_relative 'say_hello_activity'
require_relative 'say_hello_workflow'

client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'my-namespace')

worker = Temporalio::Worker.new(
  client:,
  task_queue: 'my-task-queue',
  workflows: [SayHelloWorkflow],
  activities: [SayHelloActivity]
)

worker.run(shutdown_signals: ['SIGINT'])
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Workers are a crucial part of your Temporal application as they're what actually execute the tasks defined in your Workflows and Activities.
For more information on Workers, see [Understanding Temporal](/evaluate/understanding-temporal#workers) and a [deep dive into Workers](/workers).

:::note RUN THE WORKER
In a terminal window, start your Worker by running:
`ruby worker.rb`

Keep this running in this terminal window.
You should see output indicating that the Worker has started.
Running this will run the Worker until Ctrl+C is pressed.
:::

## 5. Execute a Workflow and See the Result

With your Worker running, you can now trigger a Workflow Execution.
This final step will validate that everything is working correctly with your file labeled `execute_workflow.rb`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="execute" label="Execute Workflow (execute_workflow.rb)">

```ruby
require 'temporalio/client'
require_relative 'say_hello_workflow'

client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'my-namespace')

result = client.execute_workflow(
  SayHelloWorkflow,
  'Temporal',
  id: 'my-workflow-id',
  task_queue: 'my-task-queue'
)

puts "Result: #{result}"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Expected output:**

```
Result: Hello, Temporal!
```

:::note EXECUTE WORKFLOW
To see the expected output, run this script in a new terminal window with the following command:
`ruby execute_workflow.rb`
:::

You've successfully executed your first Temporal Workflow.
If you check the Temporal Web UI at http://localhost:8233, you'll gain visibility into your Workflow Execution with details listed about its progress and completion.

:::note ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THE WORKFLOW EXECUTION

- Temporal clients are not explicitly closed.
- To enable TLS, the `tls` option can be set to `true` or a `Temporalio::Client::Connection::TLSOptions` instance.
- Instead of `execute_workflow` above, `start_workflow` can be used to just start and get a handle.
- Both `start_workflow` and `execute_workflow` accept either the workflow class or the string/symbol name of the workflow.
- Clients are thread safe and are fiber-compatible (but fiber compatibility only supported for Ruby 3.3+ at this time).
