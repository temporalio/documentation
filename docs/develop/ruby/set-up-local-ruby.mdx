# Quickstart - Setup

This guide walks you through setting up the Temporal Ruby SDK and running your first Workflow.
In just a few steps, you'll install the SDK and start a local development server.
To validate that your local environment is correctly installed, we will execute a Workflow that will output "Hello, Temporal".

<SetupSteps>
<SetupStep code={
  <>
    <p><strong>1. Check your Ruby version:</strong></p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    ruby -v
    </CodeSnippet>
    <p>You should see output like <code>ruby 3.4.3</code>. Ruby 3.2+ is required. We recommend Ruby 3.4.3.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Create your project folder:</strong></p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    mkdir temporal-project
    cd temporal-project
    </CodeSnippet>

    <p><strong>3. Initialize with Bundler:</strong></p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    bundle init
    </CodeSnippet>

    <p><strong>4. Add the Temporal Ruby SDK:</strong></p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    bundle add temporalio
    </CodeSnippet>

    <p>You should see output like:</p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...
    Resolving dependencies...
    Installing temporalio 0.4.0 (arm64-darwin)
    Bundle complete! 1 Gemfile dependency, 6 gems now installed.
    </CodeSnippet>

    <p><strong>5. Install dependencies:</strong></p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    bundle install
    </CodeSnippet>

</>
}>

## 1. Installation

This step sets up a new Ruby project using Bundler and installs the Temporal Ruby SDK.

We recommend using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) to manage your Ruby project dependencies, including the Temporal SDK. These tutorials assume Ruby 3.4.3 or higher.

Follow the steps to create a directory, initialize the project with a `Gemfile`, and add the Temporal SDK.

**Note:**

- Only macOS ARM/x64 and Linux ARM/x64 are supported.
- Source gem is published but **cannot be built directly**.
- Windows (MinGW) is not supported.
- `fibers`/`async` are only supported on Ruby **3.3+**.
- See [Platform Support](#) for full details.

</SetupStep>

        <p>Then open a new Terminal window and start the development server:</p>
        <CodeSnippet language="bash">
        temporal server start-dev
        </CodeSnippet>
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

</>
}>

## 2. Start the Temporal Server Locally

With the SDK installed, you'll need a local Temporal Server to run your Workflows.
The easiest way to do this is with [**Temporal CLI**](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/cli/).

Choose your operating system to install Temporal CLI:

Once installed, run the development server by opening up a new terminal window:

This will:

- Start a Temporal Service on `localhost:7233`
- Launch the Web UI on [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233)
- Create the default namespace
- Use an in-memory database (data is lost when you stop the server)

Leave this running in a separate terminal tab or window while you develop.
You'll be able to monitor your Workflows through the Web UI as they execute.

</SetupStep>

<SetupStep code={
<>

<p><strong>Activity (say_hello_activity.rb):</strong></p>
<CodeSnippet language="ruby">
{`require 'temporalio/activity'

class SayHelloActivity < Temporalio::Activity::Definition
def execute(name)
"Hello, #{name}!"
end
end`}

</CodeSnippet>

<p><strong>Workflow (say_hello_workflow.rb):</strong></p>
<CodeSnippet language="ruby">
{`require 'temporalio/workflow'
require_relative 'say_hello_activity'

class SayHelloWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
def execute(name)
Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
SayHelloActivity,
name,
schedule_to_close_timeout: 300
)
end
end`}

</CodeSnippet>
</>
}>

## 3. Write Your First Activity and Workflow

Now that you have the server running, it's time to create your first Temporal application.
In Temporal, you'll create two files: an Activity file labeled `say_hello_activity.rb` and a Workflow file labeled `say_hello_workflow.rb`.

A Temporal Workflow is your business logic, defined in code, outlining each step in your process.

Activities are the individual units of work in your Workflow. Activities often involve interacting with the outside world, such as sending emails, making network requests, writing to a database, or calling an API, which are prone to failure.
You can call Activities directly from your Workflow code.
If an Activity fails, Temporal automatically retries it based on your configuration.

</SetupStep>

<SetupStep code={
<>

<p><strong>Worker (worker.rb):</strong></p>
<CodeSnippet language="ruby">
{`require 'temporalio/client'
require 'temporalio/worker'
require_relative 'say_hello_activity'
require_relative 'say_hello_workflow'

client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'default')

worker = Temporalio::Worker.new(
client:,
task_queue: 'my-task-queue',
workflows: [SayHelloWorkflow],
activities: [SayHelloActivity]
)

worker.run(shutdown_signals: ['SIGINT'])`}

</CodeSnippet>
</>
}>

## 4. Run a Worker

With your Activity and Workflow defined, you need a Worker to execute them.
Create a file labeled `worker.rb`.
Workers, which are part of your application and provided by the Temporal SDK, then carry out the tasks defined in your Workflow.

Workers are a crucial part of your Temporal application as they're what actually execute the tasks defined in your Workflows and Activities.
For more information on Workers, see [Understanding Temporal](/evaluate/understanding-temporal#workers) and a [deep dive into Workers](/workers).

:::note RUN THE WORKER
In a terminal window, start your Worker by running:
`ruby worker.rb`

Keep this running in this terminal window.
You should see output indicating that the Worker has started.
Running this will run the Worker until Ctrl+C is pressed.
:::

</SetupStep>

<SetupStep code={
<>

<p><strong>Execute Workflow (execute_workflow.rb):</strong></p>
<CodeSnippet language="ruby">
{`require 'temporalio/client'
require_relative 'say_hello_workflow'

client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'default')

result = client.execute_workflow(
SayHelloWorkflow,
'Temporal',
id: 'my-workflow-id',
task_queue: 'my-task-queue'
)

puts "Result: #{result}"`}

</CodeSnippet>

<p><strong>Expected output:</strong></p>
<CodeSnippet language="bash">
Result: Hello, Temporal!
</CodeSnippet>
<div className="success-section">
<h4>
<svg
  viewBox="0 0 24 24"
  width="20"
  height="20"
  fill="none"
  stroke="currentColor"
  strokeWidth="2"
  strokeLinecap="round"
  strokeLinejoin="round"
  className="success-icon"
>
  <path d="M9 12l2 2 4-4" />
  <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10" />
</svg>
Verify Success
</h4>
<p>If everything is working correctly, you should see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker processing the workflow and activity</li>
<li>Output: <code>Workflow result: Hello, Temporal!</code></li>
<li>Workflow Execution details in the <a href="http://localhost:8233" target="_blank">Temporal Web UI</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<style>
{`
.success-section {
  background: rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.08);
  border: 1px solid rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.2);
  border-radius: 0.75rem;
  padding: 1.25rem;

  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.5rem;
}
.success-icon {

  line-height: 1.5;
  color: var(--ifm-color-emphasis-800);
}
.success-section ul {
  margin-bottom: 0;
  padding-left: 1.5rem;
}
.success-section li {
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
  font-size: 0.95rem;
  color: var(--ifm-color-emphasis-800);
}
[data-theme='dark'] .success-section {
  background: rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.12);
  border-color: rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.3);
}
`}
</style>
</>
}>

## 5. Execute a Workflow and See the Result

With your Worker running, you can now trigger a Workflow Execution.
This final step will validate that everything is working correctly with your file labeled `execute_workflow.rb`.

:::note EXECUTE WORKFLOW
To see the expected output, run this script in a new terminal window with the following command:
`ruby execute_workflow.rb`
:::

You've successfully executed your first Temporal Workflow.
If you check the Temporal Web UI at http://localhost:8233, you'll gain visibility into your Workflow Execution with details listed about its progress and completion.

:::note ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THE WORKFLOW EXECUTION

- Temporal clients are not explicitly closed.
- To enable TLS, the `tls` option can be set to `true` or a `Temporalio::Client::Connection::TLSOptions` instance.
- Instead of `execute_workflow` above, `start_workflow` can be used to just start and get a handle.
- Both `start_workflow` and `execute_workflow` accept either the workflow class or the string/symbol name of the workflow.
- Clients are thread safe and are fiber-compatible (but fiber compatibility only supported for Ruby 3.3+ at this time).
