# Quickstart - Setup

This guide walks you through setting up the Temporal Ruby SDK and running your first Workflow.
In just a few steps, you'll install the SDK and start a local development server.
To validate that your local environment is correctly installed, we will execute a Workflow that will output "Hello, Temporal".

<SetupSteps>
<SetupStep code={
  <>
    <p><strong>1. Check your Ruby version:</strong></p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    ruby -v
    </CodeSnippet>
    <p>You should see output like <code>ruby 3.4.3</code>. Ruby 3.2+ is required. We recommend Ruby 3.4.3.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Create your project folder:</strong></p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    mkdir temporal-project
    cd temporal-project
    </CodeSnippet>

    <p><strong>3. Initialize with Bundler:</strong></p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    bundle init
    </CodeSnippet>

    <p><strong>4. Add the Temporal Ruby SDK:</strong></p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    bundle add temporalio
    </CodeSnippet>

    <p>You should see output like:</p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...
    Resolving dependencies...
    Installing temporalio 0.4.0 (arm64-darwin)
    Bundle complete! 1 Gemfile dependency, 6 gems now installed.
    </CodeSnippet>

    <p><strong>5. Install dependencies:</strong></p>
    <CodeSnippet language="bash">
    bundle install
    </CodeSnippet>

</>
}>

## Installation

This step sets up a new Ruby project using Bundler and installs the Temporal Ruby SDK.

We recommend using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) to manage your Ruby project dependencies, including the Temporal SDK. These tutorials assume Ruby 3.4.3 or higher.

Follow the steps to create a directory, initialize the project with a `Gemfile`, and add the Temporal SDK.

**Note:**

- Only macOS ARM/x64 and Linux ARM/x64 are supported.
- Source gem is published but **cannot be built directly**.
- Windows (MinGW) is not supported.
- `fibers`/`async` are only supported on Ruby **3.3+**.
- See [Platform Support](#) for full details.

## Start the Temporal Server Locally

With the SDK installed, you'll need a local Temporal Server to run your Workflows.
The easiest way to do this is with [**Temporal CLI**](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/cli/).

Choose your operating system to install Temporal CLI:

Once installed, run the development server by opening up a new terminal window:

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

This will:

- Start a Temporal Service on `localhost:7233`
- Launch the Web UI on [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233)
- Create the default namespace
- Use an in-memory database (data is lost when you stop the server)

Leave this running in a separate terminal tab or window while you develop.
You'll be able to monitor your Workflows through the Web UI as they execute.

</SetupStep>
</SetupSteps>

## Run Hello World: Test Your Installation

Now let's verify your setup is working by creating and running a complete Temporal application with both a Workflow and Activity.

This test will confirm that:

- The Temporal Ruby SDK is properly installed
- Your local Temporal Service is running
- You can successfully create and execute Workflows and Activities
- The communication between components is functioning correctly


### 1. Create the Activity

Create an Activity file (say_hello_activity.rb):

```ruby
require 'temporalio/activity'

# Implementation of a simple activity
class SayHelloActivity < Temporalio::Activity::Definition
  def execute(name)
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end
end
```

### 2. Create the Workflow

Create a Workflow file (say_hello_workflow.rb):

```ruby
require 'temporalio/workflow'
require_relative 'say_hello_activity'

class SayHelloWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute(name)
    Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
      SayHelloActivity,
      name,
      schedule_to_close_timeout: 300
    )
  end
end
```

### 3. Create and Run the Worker

With your Activity and Workflow defined, you need a Worker to execute them.
Workers are a crucial part of your Temporal application as they're what actually execute the tasks defined in your Workflows and Activities.
For more information on Workers, see [Understanding Temporal](/evaluate/understanding-temporal#workers) and a [deep dive into Workers](/workers).

Create a Worker file (worker.rb):

```ruby
require 'temporalio/client'
require 'temporalio/worker'
require_relative 'say_hello_activity'
require_relative 'say_hello_workflow'

# Create a client
client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'default')

# Create a worker with the client, activities, and workflows
worker = Temporalio::Worker.new(
  client:,
  task_queue: 'my-task-queue',
  workflows: [SayHelloWorkflow],
  # There are various forms an activity can take, see "Activities" section for details
  activities: [SayHelloActivity]
)

# Run the worker until SIGINT. This can be done in many ways, see "Workers" section for details.
worker.run(shutdown_signals: ['SIGINT'])
```

Run the Worker:

```bash
ruby worker.rb
```

### 4. Execute the Workflow

Now that your Worker is running, it's time to start a Workflow Execution.

Create a separate file called starter.rb:

```ruby
require 'temporalio/client'
require_relative 'say_hello_workflow'

# Create a client
client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'default')

# Run workflow
result = client.execute_workflow(
  SayHelloWorkflow,
  'Temporal', # This is the input to the workflow
  id: 'my-workflow-id',
  task_queue: 'my-task-queue'
)
puts "Result: #{result}"
```

Then run:

```bash
ruby starter.rb
```

### Verify Success

If everything is working correctly, you should see:

- Worker processing the workflow and activity
- Output: `Workflow result: Hello, Temporal!`
- Workflow Execution details in the [Temporal Web UI](http://localhost:8233)

## Next Steps

Now that your local environment is set up, you're ready to explore more of what Temporal can do with the Ruby SDK.

- **Build More Workflows:** Follow the [Getting Started with Ruby tutorials](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/ruby/) to building and running your first Workflow step-by-step to see Temporal's full capabilities.
- **Understand the Core Concepts**: Visit [Understanding Temporal](/evaluate/understanding-temporal) for a high-level overview of how Temporal works behind the scenes.
- **Learn by Example:** Explore our [Ruby code samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-ruby) on GitHub for practical examples that demonstrate how to use the Temporal Ruby SDK.
- **Advance to Production-Ready:** Check out the [Core Application section](/develop/ruby/core-application) of the Ruby Developer Guide to learn how to structure Temporal applications for real-world use.
