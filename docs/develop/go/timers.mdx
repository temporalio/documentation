## What is a Timer? {#timers}

A Workflow can set a durable timer for a fixed time period.
In some SDKs, the function is called `sleep()`, and in others, it's called `timer()`.

A Workflow can sleep for months.
Timers are persisted, so even if your Worker or Temporal Cluster is down when the time period completes, as soon as your Worker and Cluster are back up, the `sleep()` call will resolve and your code will continue executing.

Sleeping is a resource-light operation: it does not tie up the process, and you can run millions of Timers off a single Worker.

To set a Timer in Go, use the [`NewTimer()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#NewTimer) function and pass the duration you want to wait before continuing.

```go
timer := workflow.NewTimer(timerCtx, duration)
```

To set a sleep duration in Go, use the [`sleep()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Sleep) function and pass the duration you want to wait before continuing.
A zero or negative sleep duration causes the function to return immediately.

```go
sleep = workflow.Sleep(ctx, 10*time.Second)
```
