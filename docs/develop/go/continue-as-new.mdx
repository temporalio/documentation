description: Continue-As-New in Temporal allows a Workflow Execution to close and start a new one with the same Workflow Id, new Run Id, and fresh Event History to manage large Event Histories.
---

[Continue-As-New](/workflows#continue-as-new) enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation if the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.
The Workflow Execution spawned from the use of Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.

To cause a Workflow Execution to [Continue-As-New](/workflows#continue-as-new), the Workflow API should return the result of the [`NewContinueAsNewError()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#NewContinueAsNewError) function available from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package.

```go
func SimpleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, value string) error {
    ...
    return workflow.NewContinueAsNewError(ctx, SimpleWorkflow, value)
}
```

To check whether a Workflow Execution was spawned as a result of Continue-As-New, you can check if `workflow.GetInfo(ctx).ContinuedExecutionRunID` is not empty (i.e. `""`).

**Notes**

- To prevent Signal loss, be sure to perform an asynchronous drain on the Signal channel.
  Failure to do so can result in buffered Signals being ignored and lost.
- Make sure that the previous Workflow and the Continue-As-New Workflow are referenced by the same alias.
  Failure to do so can cause the Workflow to Continue-As-New on an entirely different Workflow.
