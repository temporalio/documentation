# Enriching the User Interface

Enhance the Temporal UI by adding contextual information to workflows and events. This makes it easier to identify and understand workflows and their operations at a glance.

## Adding Summary and Details to Workflows

#### Starting a Workflow

When starting a workflow, you can provide a static summary and details to help identify the workflow in the UI:

```go
import (
    "context"
    "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)

func main() {
    // Create the client
    c, err := client.Dial(client.Options{})
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }
    defer c.Close()

    // Start workflow options with static summary and details
    workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
        ID:        "your-workflow-id",
        TaskQueue: "your-task-queue",
        StaticSummary: "Order processing for customer #12345",
        StaticDetails: "Processing premium order with expedited shipping",
    }

    // Start the workflow
    we, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflow, "workflow input")
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

`StaticSummary` is a single-line description that appears in the workflow list view, limited to 200 bytes.
`StaticDetails` can be multi-line and provides more comprehensive information that appears in the workflow details view, with a larger limit of 20K bytes.

The input format is normal Markdown excluding: images, html, and scripts.

#### Inside the Workflow

Within a workflow, you can get and set the _current workflow details_. Unlike static summary/details set at 
workflow start, this value can be updated throughout the life of the workflow. Current workflow details 
also takes Markdown format (again, excluding images, html, and scripts) and can span multiple lines.

```go
import (
    "go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

func YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, input string) (string, error) {
    // Get the current details
    currentDetails := workflow.GetCurrentDetails(ctx)
    workflow.GetLogger(ctx).Info("Current details", "details", currentDetails)
    
    // Set/update the current details
    workflow.SetCurrentDetails(ctx, "Updated workflow details with new status")
    
    return "Workflow completed", nil
}
```

#### Adding Summary to Activities and Timers

You can attach a `Summary` to activities when starting them from within a workflow:

```go
import (
    "time"
    "go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

func YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, input string) (string, error) {
    // Activity options with summary
    ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{
        StartToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
        Summary: "Processing user data",
    }
    ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)

    // Execute the activity
    var result string
    err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivity, input).Get(ctx, &result)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    
    return result, nil
}
```

Similarly, you can attach a `Summary` to timers within a workflow:

```go
import (
    "time"
    "go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

func YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, input string) (string, error) {
    // Create a timer with options including summary
    timerFuture := workflow.NewTimerWithOptions(ctx, 5*time.Minute, workflow.TimerOptions{
        Summary: "Waiting for payment confirmation",
    })
    
    // Wait for the timer
    err := timerFuture.Get(ctx, nil)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    
    return "Timer completed", nil
}
```

The input format for `Summary` is a string, and limited to 200 bytes.
