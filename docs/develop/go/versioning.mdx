Since Workflow Executions in Temporal can run for long periods — sometimes months or even years — it's common to need to make changes to a Workflow Definition, even while a particular Workflow Execution is in progress.

The Temporal Platform requires that Workflow code is [deterministic](/workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints).
If you make a change to your Workflow code that would cause non-deterministic behavior on Replay, you'll need to use one of our Versioning methods to gracefully update your running Workflows.
With Versioning, you can modify your Workflow Definition so that new executions use the updated code, while existing ones continue running the original version.
There are two primary Versioning methods that you can use:

- [Versioning with Patching](#patching). This method works by adding branches to your code tied to specific revisions. It can be used to revise in-progress Workflows.
- [Worker Versioning](/production-deployment/worker-deployments/worker-versioning). The Worker Versioning feature allows you to tag your Workers and programmatically roll them out in versioned deployments, so that old Workers can run old code paths and new Workers can run new code paths. If you were using this method experimentally prior to summer 2025, refer to the [Worker Versioning Legacy](worker-versioning-legacy) docs.

## Versioning with Patching {#patching}

To understand why Patching is useful, it's helpful to first demonstrate cutting over an entire Workflow.

### Workflow cutovers

Since incompatible changes only affect open Workflow Executions of the same type, you can avoid determinism errors by creating a whole new Workflow when making changes.
To do this, you can copy the Workflow Definition function, giving it a different name, and make sure that both names are registered with your Workers.

For example, you would duplicate `PizzaWorkflow` as `PizzaWorkflowV2`:

```go
func PizzaWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, order PizzaOrder) (OrderConfirmation, error) {
    // this function contains the original code
}

func PizzaWorkflowV2(ctx workflow.Context, order PizzaOrder) (OrderConfirmation, error) {
    // this function contains the updated code
}
```

You can use any name you like for the new function, so long as the first character remains uppercase (this is a requirement for any Workflow Definition, since it must use an exported function).
Using some type of version identifier, such as V2 in this example, will make it easier to identify the change.

You would then need to update the Worker configuration, and any other identifier strings, to register both Workflow Types:

```go
w.RegisterWorkflow(pizza.PizzaWorkflow)
w.RegisterWorkflow(pizza.PizzaWorkflowV2)
```

The downside of this method is that it requires you to duplicate code and to update any commands used to start the Workflow.
This can become impractical over time.
This method also does not provide a way to version any still-running Workflows -- it is essentially just a cutover, unlike Patching, which we will now demonstrate.

### Patching with GetVersion

Patching essentially defines a logical branch for a specific change in the Workflow.
If your Workflow is not [pinned to a specific Worker Deployment Version](/production-deployment/worker-deployments/worker-versioning) or you need to fix a bug in a running workflow, you can patch it.

Consider the following Workflow Definition:

```go
func YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, data string) (string, error) {
        ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{
                ScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Minute,
                StartToCloseTimeout:    time.Minute,
        }
        ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)
        var result1 string
        err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
        if err != nil {
                return "", err
        }
        var result2 string
        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityB, result1).Get(ctx, &result2)
        return result2, err
}
```

Suppose you replaced `ActivityA` with `ActivityC` and deployed the updated code.

Imagine you want to revise this Workflow by adding another Activity to calculate a file checksum.
If an existing Workflow Execution was started by the original version of the Workflow code, where `ActivityA` was run, and then resumed running on a new Worker where it was replaced with `ActivityC`, the server side Event History would be out of sync.
This would cause the Workflow to fail with a nondeterminism error.

To resolve this, you can use `workflow.GetVersion()` to patch to your Workflow:

```go
var err error
v := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, "Step1", workflow.DefaultVersion, 1)
if v == workflow.DefaultVersion {
        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
} else {
        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityC, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
}
if err != nil {
        return "", err
}

var result2 string
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityB, result1).Get(ctx, &result2)
return result2, err
```

When `workflow.GetVersion()` is run for the new Workflow Execution, it records a marker in the Event History so that all future calls to `GetVersion` for this change Id — `Step 1` in the example — on this Workflow Execution will always return the given version number, which is `1` in the example.

If you make an additional change, such as replacing ActivityC with ActivityD, you need to
add some additional code:

```go
v := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, "Step1", workflow.DefaultVersion, 2)
if v == workflow.DefaultVersion {
        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
} else if v == 1 {
        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityC, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
} else {
        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
}
```

Note that we changed `maxSupported` from 1 to 2.
A Workflow that has already passed this `GetVersion()` call before it was introduced returns `DefaultVersion`.
A Workflow that was run with `maxSupported` set to 1 returns 1.
New Workflows return 2.

After you are sure that all of the Workflow Executions prior to version 1 have completed, you can remove the code for that version:

```go
v := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, "Step1", 1, 2)
if v == 1 {
        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityC, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
} else {
        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
}
```

You'll note that `minSupported` has changed from `DefaultVersion` to `1`.
If an older version of the Workflow Execution history is replayed on this code, it fails because the minimum expected version is 1.
After you are sure that all of the Workflow Executions for version 1 have completed, you can remove version 1 so that your code looks like the following:

```go
_ := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, "Step1", 2, 2)
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
```

Note that we have preserved the call to `GetVersion()`. There are two reasons to preserve this call:

1. This ensures that if there is a Workflow Execution still running for an older version, it will
   fail here and not proceed.
2. If you need to make additional changes for `Step1`, such as changing ActivityD to ActivityE, you
   only need to update `maxVersion` from 2 to 3 and branch from there.

You need to preserve only the first call to `GetVersion()` for each `changeID`.
All subsequent calls to `GetVersion()` with the same change Id are safe to remove.
If necessary, you can remove the first `GetVersion()` call, but you need to ensure the following:

- All executions with an older version are completed.
- You can no longer use `Step1` for the changeId. If you need to make changes to that same part in
  the future, such as change from ActivityD to ActivityE, you would need to use a different changeId
  like `Step1-fix2`, and start minVersion from DefaultVersion again. The code would look like the
  following:

```go
v := workflow.GetVersion(ctx, "Step1-fix2", workflow.DefaultVersion, 1)
if v == workflow.DefaultVersion {
        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityD, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
} else {
        err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityE, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
}
```

You can add multiple calls to `GetVersion` in a single Workflow.
This can become challenging to manage if you have many long-running Workflows, as you will wind up with many code branches over time.
To clean these up, you can gradually deprecate older Workflow versions.

### Deprecating old Workflow versions

You can safely remove support for older Workflow versions once you are certain that there are no longer any open Workflow Executions based on that version. You can use the following [List Filter](/list-filter) syntax for this (the 1 near the end of the last line represents the version number):

```
WorkflowType = "PizzaWorkflow" 
    AND ExecutionStatus = "Running" 
    AND TemporalChangeVersion="ChangedNotificationActivityType-1"
```

Since Workflow Executions that were started before `GetVersion` was added to the code won't have the associated Marker in their Event History, you'll need to use a different query to determine if any of those are still running:

```
WorkflowType = "PizzaWorkflow" 
    AND ExecutionStatus = "Running" 
    AND TemporalChangeVersion IS NULL
```

If you have found that there are no longer any open executions for the first two versions of the Workflow, for example, then you could remove support for them by changing the code as shown below:

```go
version := GetVersion(ctx, "ChangedNotificationActivityType", 2, 3)
if version  == 2 {
    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, SendTextMessage).Get(ctx, nil)
} else {
    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, SendTweet).Get(ctx, nil)
}
```

When `workflow.GetVersion()` is run for a new Workflow execution, it records a marker in the Workflow history so that all future calls to `GetVersion()` for this change ID — Step 1 in the example — on this Workflow execution will always return the given version number.

Patching allows you to make changes to currently running Workflows.
It is a powerful method for introducing compatible changes without introducing non-determinism errors.

## Worker Versioning

Temporal's [Worker Versioning](/production-deployment/worker-deployments/worker-versioning) feature allows you to tag your Workers and programmatically roll them out in Deployment Versions, so that old Workers can run old code paths and new Workers can run new code paths. This way, you can pin your Workflows to specific revisions, avoiding the need for patching.

## Runtime checking {#runtime-checking}

The Temporal Go SDK performs a runtime check to help prevent obvious incompatible changes.
Adding, removing, or reordering any of these methods without Versioning triggers the runtime check and results in a nondeterminism error:

- `workflow.ExecuteActivity()`
- `workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow()`
- `workflow.NewTimer()`
- `workflow.RequestCancelWorkflow()`
- `workflow.SideEffect()`
- `workflow.SignalExternalWorkflow()`
- `workflow.Sleep()`

The runtime check does not perform a thorough check.
For example, it does not check on the Activity's input arguments or the Timer duration.
Each Temporal SDK implements these sanity checks differently, and they are not a complete check for non-deterministic changes.
Instead, you should incorporate [Replay Testing](/develop/go/testing-suite#replay) when making revisions.
