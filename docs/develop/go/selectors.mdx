description: Learn how to use Temporalâ€™s Go SDK Selectors with Futures, Timers, and Channels. Ensure deterministic Workflow execution and handle multiple parallel tasks efficiently.

This page shows how to do the following:

- [Use Selectors with Futures](#use-selectors-with-futures)
- [Use Selectors with Timers](#use-selectors-with-timers)
- [Use Selectors with Channels](#use-selectors-with-channels)

In Go, the `select` statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.
A `select` **blocks until one of its cases can run**, then it executes that case.
It chooses one at random if multiple are ready.

However, a normal Go select statement can not be used inside of Workflows directly because of the random nature.
Temporal's Go SDK `Selector`s are similar and act as a replacement.
They can block on sending and receiving from Channels but as a bonus can listen on Future deferred work.
Usage of Selectors to defer and process work (in place of Go's `select`) are necessary in order to ensure deterministic Workflow code execution (though using `select` in Activity code is fine).

## Full API example {#api-example}

The API is sufficiently different from `select` that it bears documenting:

```go
func SampleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) error {
	// standard Workflow setup code omitted...

	// API Example: declare a new selector
	selector := workflow.NewSelector(ctx)

	// API Example: defer code execution until the Future that represents Activity result is ready
	work := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ExampleActivity)
	selector.AddFuture(work, func(f workflow.Future) {
		// deferred code omitted...
	})

	// more parallel timers and activities initiated...

	// API Example: receive information from a Channel
	var signalVal string
	channel := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, channelName)
	selector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {
		// matching on the channel doesn't consume the message.
	 	// So it has to be explicitly consumed here
		c.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)
		// do something with received information
	})

	// API Example: block until the next Future is ready to run
	// important! none of the deferred code runs until you call selector.Select
	selector.Select(ctx)

	// Todo: document selector.HasPending
}
```

## Use Selectors with Futures

You usually add `Future`s after `Activities`:

```go
// API Example: defer code execution until after an activity is done
work := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ExampleActivity)
selector.AddFuture(work, func(f workflow.Future) {
	// deferred code omitted...
})
```

`selector.Select(ctx)` is the primary mechanism which blocks on and executes `Future` work.
It is intentionally flexible; you may call it conditionally or multiple times:

```go
	// API Example: blocking conditionally
  if somecondition != nil {
		selector.Select(ctx)
  }

	// API Example: popping off all remaining Futures
  for i := 0; i < len(someArray); i++ {
		selector.Select(ctx) // this will wait for one branch
		// you can interrupt execution here
	}
```

A Future matches only once per Selector instance even if Select is called multiple times.
If multiple items are available, the order of matching is not defined.

## Use Selectors with Timers

An important use case of futures is setting up a race between a timer and a pending activity, effectively adding a "soft" timeout that doesn't result in any errors or retries of that activity.

For example, [the Timer sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/master/timer) shows how you can write a long running order processing operation where:

- if processing takes too long, we send out a notification email to user about the delay, but we won't cancel the operation
- if the operation finishes before the timer fires, then we want to cancel the timer.

```go
var processingDone bool
f := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, OrderProcessingActivity)
selector.AddFuture(f, func(f workflow.Future) {
	processingDone = true
	// cancel timerFuture
	cancelHandler()
})

// use timer future to send notification email if processing takes too long
timerFuture := workflow.NewTimer(childCtx, processingTimeThreshold)
selector.AddFuture(timerFuture, func(f workflow.Future) {
	if !processingDone {
		// processing is not done yet when timer fires, send notification email
		_ = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, SendEmailActivity).Get(ctx, nil)
	}
})

// wait the timer or the order processing to finish
selector.Select(ctx)
```

We create timers with the `workflow.NewTimer` API.

## Use Selectors with Channels

`selector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {})` is the primary mechanism which receives messages from `Channels`.

```go
// API Example: receive information from a Channel
var signalVal string
channel := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, channelName)
selector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {
	c.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)
	// do something with received information
})
```

Merely matching on the channel doesn't consume the message; it has to be explicitly consumed with a `c.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)` call.

## Query Selector state

You can use the `selector.HasPending` API to ensure that signals are not lost when a Workflow is closed (e.g. by `ContinueAsNew`).

Usage of Selectors is best learned by example:

- Setting up a race condition between an Activity and a Timer, and conditionally execute ([Timer example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/14980b3792cc3a8447318fefe9a73fe0a580d4b9/timer/workflow.go))
- Receiving information in a Channel ([Mutex example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/14980b3792cc3a8447318fefe9a73fe0a580d4b9/mutex/mutex_workflow.go))
- Looping through a list of work and scheduling them all in parallel ([DSL example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/14980b3792cc3a8447318fefe9a73fe0a580d4b9/dsl/workflow.go))
- Executing activities in parallel, pick the first result, cancel remainder ([Pick First example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/14980b3792cc3a8447318fefe9a73fe0a580d4b9/pickfirst/pickfirst_workflow.go))
