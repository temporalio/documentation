## How to install the Temporal CLI and run a development server {#run-a-development-server}

This section describes how to install the [Temporal CLI](/cli) and run a development Temporal Service.
The local development Temporal Service comes packaged with the [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui).

For information on deploying and running a self-hosted production Temporal Service, see the [Self-hosted guide](/self-hosted-guide), or sign up for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud) and let us run your production Temporal Service for you.

The Temporal CLI is a tool for interacting with a Temporal Service from the command line and it includes a distribution of the Temporal Server and Web UI.
This local development Temporal Service runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies and it supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.
