## Failure detection

The [Failure detection feature guide](/develop/go/failure-detection) shows how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

## Asynchronous Activity Completion

The [Asynchronous Activity Completion feature guide](/develop/go/asynchronous-activity-completion) shows how to complete Activities asynchronously.

## Versioning

The [Versioning feature guide](/develop/go/versioning) shows how to change Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [Temporal Go SDK Patching APIs](/develop/go/versioning#temporal-go-sdk-patching-apis)
