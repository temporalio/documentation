These Temporal Go SDK feature guides aim to show how to use Temporal features when developing [Temporal Applications](/temporal#temporal-application).

## Core application

The [Core Application feature guide](/develop/go/core-application) shows how to use the basic building blocks of a Temporal Application (Workflows, Activities, and Workers).

- [How to develop a basic Workflow](/develop/go/core-application#develop-workflows)
- [How to develop an Activity Definition in Go](/develop/go/core-application#activity-definition)
- [How to start an Activity Execution](/develop/go/core-application#activity-execution)
- [How to develop a Worker in Go](/develop/go/core-application#develop-worker)
- [How to run a Temporal Cloud Worker](/develop/go/core-application#run-a-temporal-cloud-worker)

## Temporal Client

The [Temporal Client feature guide](/develop/go/temporal-clients) shows how to connect to a Temporal Service and start a Workflow Execution.

- [Connect to development Temporal Service](/develop/go/temporal-clients#connect-to-development-service)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](/develop/go/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Start Workflow Execution](/develop/go/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)
- [How to start a Workflow Execution](/develop/go/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)

## Testing suites

The [Testing suite feature guide](/develop/go/testing-suite) shows how to set up the testing suite and test Workflows and Activities.

- [Test frameworks](/develop/go/testing-suite#test-frameworks)
- [Test setup](/develop/go/testing-suite#test-setup)
- [Testing Activities](/develop/go/testing-suite#test-activities)
- [Mock and override Activities](/develop/go/testing-suite#mock-and-override-activities)
- [Testing Workflows](/develop/go/testing-suite#test-workflows)
- [How to Replay a Workflow Execution](/develop/go/testing-suite#replay)

## Failure detection

The [Failure detection feature guide](/develop/go/failure-detection) shows how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

- [Workflow timeouts](/develop/go/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts)
- [How to set Activity timeouts](/develop/go/failure-detection#activity-timeouts)
- [How to Heartbeat an Activity](/develop/go/failure-detection#activity-heartbeats)

## Messages

The [Workflow messages feature guide](/develop/go/message-passing) shows how to send messages to and read the state of Workflow Executions.

- [How to develop with Signals](/develop/go/message-passing#signals)
- [How to develop with Queries](/develop/go/message-passing#queries)
- [How to develop with Updates](/develop/go/message-passing#updates)

## Asynchronous Activity Completion

The [Asynchronous Activity Completion feature guide](/develop/go/asynchronous-activity-completion) shows how to complete Activities asynchronously.

## Versioning

The [Versioning feature guide](/develop/go/versioning) shows how to change Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [Temporal Go SDK Patching APIs](/develop/go/versioning#patching)
- [Sanity checking](/develop/go/versioning#sanity-checking)
- [How to use Worker Versioning in Go](/develop/go/versioning#worker-versioning)

## Observability

The [Observability feature guide](/develop/go/observability) shows how to configure and use the Temporal Observability APIs.

- [How to emit metrics](/develop/go/observability#metrics)
- [Tracing and Context Propagation](/develop/go/observability#tracing-and-context-propogation)
- [How to log from a Workflow](/develop/go/observability#logging)
- [How to use Visibility APIs](/develop/go/observability#visibility)

## Debugging

The [Debugging feature guide](/develop/go/debugging) covers the various ways to debug your application.

- [How to debug in a development environment](/develop/go/debugging#debug-in-a-development-environment)
- [How to debug in a production environment](/develop/go/debugging#debug-in-a-production-environment)
- [How to test Workflow Definitions in Go](/develop/go/debugging#testing-and-debugging)

## Schedules

The [Schedules feature guide](/develop/go/schedules) shows how to schedule Workflows, run Workflows on a Cron, and to delay the start of a Workflow.

- [How to Schedule a Workflow](/develop/go/schedules#schedule-a-workflow)
- [How to use Temporal Cron Jobs](/develop/go/schedules#temporal-cron-jobs)

## Data encryption

The [Data encryption feature guide](/develop/go/data-encryption) provides guidance on how to support compression, encryption, and other data handling by implementing custom converters and codecs.

- [How to use a custom Payload Codec in Go](/develop/go/data-encryption#custom-payload-codec)
- [How to use custom payload conversion](/develop/go/data-encryption#custom-payload-conversion)
- [How to use a custom Payload Converter in Go](/develop/go/data-encryption#custom-payload-converter)

## Child Workflows

The [Child Workflows feature guide](/develop/go/child-workflows) shows how to spawn a Child Workflow Execution and handle Child Workflow Events.

- [How to start a Child Workflow Execution](/develop/go/child-workflows#child-workflows)

## Continue-As-New

The [Continue-As-New feature guide](/develop/go/continue-as-new) shows how to continue the Workflow Execution with a new Workflow Execution using the same Workflow ID.

- [How to Continue-As-New](/develop/go/continue-as-new)

## Timers
