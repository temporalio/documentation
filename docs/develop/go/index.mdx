## Install and get started

You can find detailed installation instructions for the Go SDK in the [Quickstart](/develop/go/set-up-your-local-go).

There's also a short walkthrough of how to use the Temporal primitives (Activities, Workflows, and Workers) to build and run a Temporal application to get you up and running.

Once your local Temporal Service is set up, continue building with the following resources:

- [Activity Basics](/develop/go/activities/basics)
- [Workflow Basics](/develop/go/workflows/basics)
- [Start an Activity Execution](/develop/go/activities/execution)
- [Run Worker Processes](/develop/go/workers/run-worker-process)

From there, you can dive deeper into any of the Temporal primitives to start building Workflows that fit your use cases.

### Where are SDK-specific code examples? {#code-samples}

- [Background Check application](https://github.com/temporalio/background-checks): Provides a non-trivial Temporal Application implementation in conjunction with [application documentation](https://learn.temporal.io/examples/go/background-checks/).
- [Hello world application template in Go](https://github.com/temporalio/hello-world-project-template-go): Provides a quick-start development app for users.
  This sample works in conjunction with the ["Hello World!" from scratch tutorial in Go](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/go/hello_world_in_go/).
- [Money transfer application template in Go](https://github.com/temporalio/money-transfer-project-template-go): Provides a quick-start development app for users.
  It demonstrates a basic "money transfer" Workflow Definition and works in conjunction with the [Run your first app tutorial in Go](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/go/first_program_in_go/).
- [Subscription-style Workflow Definition in Go](https://github.com/temporalio/subscription-workflow-project-template-go): Demonstrates some of the patterns that could be implemented for a subscription-style business process.
- [eCommerce application example in Go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-ecommerce): Showcases a per-user shopping cart–style Workflow Definition that includes an API for adding and removing items from the cart as well as a web UI.
  This application sample works in conjunction with the [eCommerce in Go tutorial](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/go/build-an-ecommerce-app).
