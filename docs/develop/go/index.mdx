- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](/develop/go/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Start Workflow Execution](/develop/go/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)
- [How to start a Workflow Execution](/develop/go/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)

- [Testing Workflows](/develop/go/testing-suite#test-workflows)
- [How to Replay a Workflow Execution](/develop/go/testing-suite#replay)

## Failure detection

The [Failure detection feature guide](/develop/go/failure-detection) shows how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

- [Workflow timeouts](/develop/go/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts)
- [How to set Activity timeouts](/develop/go/failure-detection#activity-timeouts)
- [How to Heartbeat an Activity](/develop/go/failure-detection#activity-heartbeats)

## Messages

The [Workflow messages feature guide](/develop/go/message-passing) shows how to send messages to and read the state of Workflow Executions.

- [How to develop with Signals](/develop/go/message-passing#signals)
- [How to develop with Queries](/develop/go/message-passing#queries)
- [How to develop with Updates](/develop/go/message-passing#updates)

## Asynchronous Activity Completion

The [Asynchronous Activity Completion feature guide](/develop/go/asynchronous-activity-completion) shows how to complete Activities asynchronously.

## Versioning

The [Versioning feature guide](/develop/go/versioning) shows how to change Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [Temporal Go SDK Patching APIs](/develop/go/versioning#patching)
- [Sanity checking](/develop/go/versioning#sanity-checking)
- [How to use Worker Versioning in Go](/develop/go/versioning#worker-versioning)

## Observability

The [Observability feature guide](/develop/go/observability) shows how to configure and use the Temporal Observability APIs.

- [How to emit metrics](/develop/go/observability#metrics)
- [Tracing and Context Propagation](/develop/go/observability#tracing-and-context-propogation)
- [How to log from a Workflow](/develop/go/observability#logging)

## Debugging

The [Debugging feature guide](/develop/go/debugging) covers the various ways to debug your application.

- [How to debug in a development environment](/develop/go/debugging#debug-in-a-development-environment)
- [How to debug in a production environment](/develop/go/debugging#debug-in-a-production-environment)
- [How to test Workflow Definitions in Go](/develop/go/debugging#testing-and-debugging)

## Schedules

The [Schedules feature guide](/develop/go/schedules) shows how to schedule Workflows, run Workflows on a Cron, and to delay the start of a Workflow.

- [How to Schedule a Workflow](/develop/go/schedules#schedule-a-workflow)
- [How to use Temporal Cron Jobs](/develop/go/schedules#temporal-cron-jobs)

## Data encryption

The [Data encryption feature guide](/develop/go/data-encryption) provides guidance on how to support compression, encryption, and other data handling by implementing custom converters and codecs.
