description: The Foundations section of the Temporal Developer's guide introduces essential concepts for building and running a Temporal Application, outlining steps to start Workflow and Activity Execution, running development Workers, and installing the Temporal CLI.
---

The Foundations section of the Temporal Developer's guide covers the minimum set of concepts and implementation details needed to build and run a [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application)—that is, all the relevant steps to start a [Workflow Execution](#develop-workflows) that executes an [Activity](#activity-definition).

In this section you can find the following:

- [Run a development Temporal Service](#run-a-development-server)
- [Develop a Workflow](#develop-workflows)
- [Develop an Activity](#activity-definition)
- [Start an Activity Execution](#activity-execution)
- [Run a dev Worker](#develop-worker)
- [Run a Temporal Cloud Worker](#run-a-temporal-cloud-worker)

## How to install the Temporal CLI and run a development server {#run-a-development-server}

This section describes how to install the [Temporal CLI](/cli) and run a development Temporal Service.
The local development Temporal Service comes packaged with the [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui).

For information on deploying and running a self-hosted production Temporal Service, see the [Self-hosted guide](/self-hosted-guide), or sign up for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud) and let us run your production Temporal Service for you.

The Temporal CLI is a tool for interacting with a Temporal Service from the command line and it includes a distribution of the Temporal Server and Web UI.
This local development Temporal Service runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies and it supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.

**Install the Temporal CLI**

The Temporal CLI is available on MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

### MacOS

This command automatically starts the Web UI, creates the default [Namespace](/namespaces), and uses an in-memory database.

The Temporal Server should be available on `localhost:7233` and the Temporal Web UI should be accessible at [`http://localhost:8233`](http://localhost:8233/).

The server's startup configuration can be customized using command line options.
For a full list of options, run:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --help
```

## How to install a Temporal SDK {#install-a-temporal-sdk}

A [Temporal SDK](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks) provides a framework for [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application) development.

An SDK provides you with the following:

- A [Temporal Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) to communicate with a [Temporal Service](/clusters).
- APIs to develop [Workflows](/workflows).
- APIs to create and manage [Worker Processes](/workers#worker).
- APIs to author [Activities](/activities#activity-definition).

Add the [Temporal Go SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go) to your project:

```bash
go get go.temporal.io/sdk
```

Or clone the Go SDK repo to your preferred location:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:temporalio/sdk-go.git
```

### How to find the Go SDK API reference {#api-reference}

The Temporal Go SDK API reference is published on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk).

- Short link: [`t.mp/go-api`](https://t.mp/go-api)

### Where are SDK-specific code examples? {#code-samples}

You can find a complete list of executable code samples in [Temporal's GitHub repository](https://github.com/temporalio?q=samples-&type=all&language=&sort=).

Additionally, several of the [Tutorials](https://learn.temporal.io) are backed by a fully executable template application.

## How to develop a basic Workflow {#develop-workflows}

Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a [Workflow Definition](/workflows#workflow-definition).

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, a [Workflow Definition](/workflows#workflow-definition) is an exportable function.
Below is an example of a basic Workflow Definition.

<div className="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/go/yourapp/your_workflow_definition_dacx.go">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```go
package yourapp

import (
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)
// ...

// YourSimpleWorkflowDefintiion is the most basic Workflow Defintion.
func YourSimpleWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context) error {
	// ...
	return nil
}
```

### How to define Workflow parameters {#workflow-parameters}

Temporal Workflows may have any number of custom parameters.
However, we strongly recommend that objects are used as parameters, so that the object's individual fields may be altered without breaking the signature of the Workflow.
All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable.

The first parameter of a Go-based Workflow Definition must be of the [`workflow.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Context) type.
It is used by the Temporal Go SDK to pass around Workflow Execution context, and virtually all the Go SDK APIs that are callable from the Workflow require it.
It is acquired from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow) package.

The `workflow.Context` entity operates similarly to the standard `context.Context` entity provided by Go.
The only difference between `workflow.Context` and `context.Context` is that the `Done()` function, provided by `workflow.Context`, returns `workflow.Channel` instead of the standard Go `chan`.

Additional parameters can be passed to the Workflow when it is invoked.
A Workflow Definition may support multiple custom parameters, or none.
These parameters can be regular type variables or safe pointers.
However, the best practice is to pass a single parameter that is of a `struct` type, so there can be some backward compatibility if new parameters are added.

All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable and can't be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers.

<div className="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/go/yourapp/your_workflow_definition_dacx.go">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```go
package yourapp

import (
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

// YourWorkflowParam is the object passed to the Workflow.
type YourWorkflowParam struct {
	WorkflowParamX string
	WorkflowParamY int
}
// ...
// YourWorkflowDefinition is your custom Workflow Definition.
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (*YourWorkflowResultObject, error) {
// ...
}
```

### How to define Workflow return parameters {#workflow-return-values}

Workflow return values must also be serializable.
Returning results, returning errors, or throwing exceptions is fairly idiomatic in each language that is supported.
However, Temporal APIs that must be used to get the result of a Workflow Execution will only ever receive one of either the result or the error.

A Go-based Workflow Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination.
Again, the best practice here is to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values.
A Workflow Definition written in Go can return both a custom value and an error.
However, it's not possible to receive both a custom value and an error in the calling process, as is normal in Go.
The caller will receive either one or the other.
Returning a non-nil `error` from a Workflow indicates that an error was encountered during its execution and the Workflow Execution should be terminated, and any custom return values will be ignored by the system.

  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```go
package yourapp

import (
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)
// ...

// YourWorkflowResultObject is the object returned by the Workflow.
type YourWorkflowResultObject struct {
	WFResultFieldX string
	WFResultFieldY int
}
// ...
// YourWorkflowDefinition is your custom Workflow Definition.
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (*YourWorkflowResultObject, error) {
// ...
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	// Make the results of the Workflow Execution available.
	workflowResult := &YourWorkflowResultObject{
		WFResultFieldX: activityResult.ResultFieldX,
		WFResultFieldY: activityResult.ResultFieldY,
	}
	return workflowResult, nil
}
```

### How to customize Workflow Type in Go {#customize-workflow-type}

In Go, by default, the Workflow Type name is the same as the function name.

To customize the Workflow Type, set the `Name` parameter with `RegisterOptions` when registering your Workflow with a Worker.

<div className="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/go/yourapp/worker/main_dacx.go">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/activity"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"

	"documentation-samples-go/yourapp"
)
// ...
func main() {
// ...
	yourWorker := worker.New(temporalClient, "your-custom-task-queue-name", worker.Options{})
// ...
	// Use RegisterOptions to set the name of the Workflow Type for example.
	registerWFOptions := workflow.RegisterOptions{
		Name: "JustAnotherWorkflow",
	}
	yourWorker.RegisterWorkflowWithOptions(yourapp.YourSimpleWorkflowDefinition, registerWFOptions)
// ...
}
```

### How to develop Workflow logic {#workflow-logic-requirements}

Workflow logic is constrained by [deterministic execution requirements](/workflows#deterministic-constraints).
Therefore, each language is limited to the use of certain idiomatic techniques.
However, each Temporal SDK provides a set of APIs that can be used inside your Workflow to interact with external (to the Workflow) application code.

In Go, Workflow Definition code cannot directly do the following:

- Iterate over maps using `range`, because with `range` the order of the map's iteration is randomized.
  Instead you can collect the keys of the map, sort them, and then iterate over the sorted keys to access the map.
  This technique provides deterministic results.
  You can also use a Side Effect or an Activity to process the map instead.
- Call an external API, conduct a file I/O operation, talk to another service, etc. (Use an Activity for these.)

The Temporal Go SDK has APIs to handle equivalent Go constructs:

- `workflow.Now()` This is a replacement for `time.Now()`.
- `workflow.Sleep()` This is a replacement for `time.Sleep()`.
- `workflow.GetLogger()` This ensures that the provided logger does not duplicate logs during a replay.
- `workflow.Go()` This is a replacement for the `go` statement.
- `workflow.Channel` This is a replacement for the native `chan` type.
  Temporal provides support for both buffered and unbuffered channels.
- `workflow.Selector` This is a replacement for the `select` statement.
  Learn more on the [Go SDK Selectors](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/go/selectors) page.
- `workflow.Context` This is a replacement for `context.Context`.
  See [Tracing](/develop/go/observability#tracing-and-context-propogation) for more information about context propagation.

## How to develop an Activity Definition in Go {#activity-definition}

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity Definition is an exportable function or a `struct` method.
Below is an example of both a basic Activity Definition and of an Activity defined as a Struct method.
An _Activity struct_ can have more than one method, with each method acting as a separate Activity Type.
Activities written as struct methods can use shared struct variables, such as:

- an application level DB pool
- client connection to another service
- reusable utilities
- any other expensive resources that you only want to initialize once per process

Because this is such a common need, the rest of this guide shows Activities written as `struct` methods.

    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```go
package yourapp

import (
	"context"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/activity"
)
// ...

// YourSimpleActivityDefinition is a basic Activity Definiton.
func YourSimpleActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context) error {
	return nil
}

// YourActivityObject is the struct that maintains shared state across Activities.
// If the Worker crashes this Activity object loses its state.
type YourActivityObject struct {
	Message *string
	Number  *int
}

// YourActivityDefinition is your custom Activity Definition.
// An Activity Definiton is an exportable function.
func (a *YourActivityObject) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (*YourActivityResultObject, error) {
// ...
}
```

### How to develop Activity Parameters {#activity-parameters}

There is no explicit limit to the total number of parameters that an [Activity Definition](/activities#activity-definition) may support.
However, there is a limit to the total size of the data that ends up encoded into a gRPC message Payload.

A single argument is limited to a maximum size of 2 MB.
And the total size of a gRPC message, which includes all the arguments, is limited to a maximum of 4 MB.

Also, keep in mind that all Payload data is recorded in the [Workflow Execution Event History](/workflows#event-history) and large Event Histories can affect Worker performance.
This is because the entire Event History could be transferred to a Worker Process with a [Workflow Task](/workers#workflow-task).

{/* TODO link to gRPC limit section when available */}

Some SDKs require that you pass context objects, others do not.
When it comes to your application data—that is, data that is serialized and encoded into a Payload—we recommend that you use a single object as an argument that wraps the application data passed to Activities.
This is so that you can change what data is passed to the Activity without breaking a function or method signature.

The first parameter of an Activity Definition is `context.Context`.
This parameter is optional for an Activity Definition, though it is recommended, especially if the Activity is expected to use other Go SDK APIs.

An Activity Definition can support as many other custom parameters as needed.
However, all parameters must be serializable (parameters can't be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers), and it is recommended to pass a single struct that can be updated later.

  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```go
// YourActivityParam is the struct passed to your Activity.
// Use a struct so that your function signature remains compatible if fields change.
type YourActivityParam struct {
	ActivityParamX string
	ActivityParamY int
}
// ...
func (a *YourActivityObject) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (*YourActivityResultObject, error) {
// ...
}
```

### How to define Activity return values {#activity-return-values}

All data returned from an Activity must be serializable.

There is no explicit limit to the amount of data that can be returned by an Activity, but keep in mind that all return values are recorded in a [Workflow Execution Event History](/workflows#event-history).

A Go-based Activity Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination (same as a Workflow Definition).
You may wish to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values, just keep in mind they must all be serializable.

  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```go
// YourActivityResultObject is the struct returned from your Activity.
// Use a struct so that you can return multiple values of different types.
// Additionally, your function signature remains compatible if the fields change.
type YourActivityResultObject struct {
	ResultFieldX string
	ResultFieldY int
}
// ...
func (a *YourActivityObject) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (*YourActivityResultObject, error) {
// ...
	result := &YourActivityResultObject{
		ResultFieldX: "Success",
		ResultFieldY: 1,
	}
	// Return the results back to the Workflow Execution.
	// The results persist within the Event History of the Workflow Execution.
	return result, nil
}
```

### How to customize Activity Type in Go {#customize-activity-type}

To customize the Activity Type, set the `Name` parameter with `RegisterOptions` when registering your Activity with a Worker.

<div className="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/go/yourapp/worker/main_dacx.go">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```go
func main() {
// ...
	yourWorker := worker.New(temporalClient, "your-custom-task-queue-name", worker.Options{})
// ...
	// Use RegisterOptions to change the name of the Activity Type for example.
	registerAOptions := activity.RegisterOptions{
		Name: "JustAnotherActivity",
	}
	yourWorker.RegisterActivityWithOptions(yourapp.YourSimpleActivityDefinition, registerAOptions)
	// Run the Worker
	err = yourWorker.Run(worker.InterruptCh())
// ...
}
// ...
```

## How to start an Activity Execution {#activity-execution}

Calls to spawn [Activity Executions](/activities#activity-execution) are written within a [Workflow Definition](/workflows#workflow-definition).
The call to spawn an Activity Execution generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands#scheduleactivitytask) Command.
This results in the set of three [Activity Task](/workers#activity-task) related Events ([ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events#activitytaskscheduled), [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events#activitytaskstarted), and ActivityTask[Closed])in your Workflow Execution Event History.

A single instance of the Activities implementation is shared across multiple simultaneous Activity invocations.
Activity implementation code should be _idempotent_.

The values passed to Activities through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the Execution history.
The entire Execution history is transferred from the Temporal Service to Workflow Workers when a Workflow state needs to recover.
A large Execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.

Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data you transfer through Activity invocation parameters or Return Values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.

    To spawn an [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution), call [`ExecuteActivity()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/workflow#ExecuteActivity) inside your Workflow Definition.
    The API is available from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/workflow) package.
    The `ExecuteActivity()` API call requires an instance of `workflow.Context`, the Activity function name, and any variables to be passed to the Activity Execution.
    	The Activity function name can be provided as a variable object (no quotations) or as a string.
        The benefit of passing the actual function object is that the framework can validate the parameters against the Activity Definition.
        The `ExecuteActivity` call returns a Future, which can be used to get the result of the Activity Execution.

  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (*YourWorkflowResultObject, error) {
	// Set the options for the Activity Execution.
	// Either StartToClose Timeout OR ScheduleToClose is required.
	// Not specifying a Task Queue will default to the parent Workflow Task Queue.
	activityOptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
		StartToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
	}
	ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityOptions)
	activityParam := YourActivityParam{
		ActivityParamX: param.WorkflowParamX,
		ActivityParamY: param.WorkflowParamY,
	}
	// Use a nil struct pointer to call Activities that are part of a struct.
	var a *YourActivityObject
	// Execute the Activity and wait for the result.
	var activityResult YourActivityResultObject
	err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, a.YourActivityDefinition, activityParam).Get(ctx, &activityResult)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
// ...
}
```

### How to set the required Activity Timeouts {#required-timeout}

Activity Execution semantics rely on several parameters.
The only required value that needs to be set is either a [Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-close-timeout) or a [Start-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout).
These values are set in the Activity Options.

To set an Activity Timeout in Go, create an instance of `ActivityOptions` from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package, set the Activity Timeout field, and then use the `WithActivityOptions()` API to apply the options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

Available timeouts are:

- `StartToCloseTimeout`
- `ScheduleToClose`
- `ScheduleToStartTimeout`

```go
activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  // Set Activity Timeout duration
  ScheduleToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
  // StartToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
  // ScheduleToStartTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

### Go ActivityOptions reference {#activity-options-reference}

Create an instance of [`ActivityOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ActivityOptions) from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package and use [`WithActivityOptions()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#WithActivityOptions) to apply it to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

The instance of `workflow.Context` is then passed to the `ExecuteActivity()` call.

This or `StartToCloseTimeout` must be set.

- Type: `time.Duration`
- Default: ∞ (infinity - no limit)

```go
activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  ScheduleToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

#### ScheduleToStartTimeout

To set a [Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-start-timeout), create an instance of `ActivityOptions` from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package, set the `ScheduleToStartTimeout` field, and then use the `WithActivityOptions()` API to apply the options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

- Type: `time.Duration`
- Default: ∞ (infinity - no limit)

```go
activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  ScheduleToStartTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

#### StartToCloseTimeout

To set a [Start-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout), create an instance of `ActivityOptions` from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package, set the `StartToCloseTimeout` field, and then use the `WithActivityOptions()` API to apply the options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

This or `ScheduleToCloseTimeout` must be set.

- Type: `time.Duration`
- Default: Same as the `ScheduleToCloseTimeout`

```go
activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  StartToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

#### HeartbeatTimeout

To set a [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout), create an instance of `ActivityOptions` from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package, set the `RetryPolicy` field, and then use the `WithActivityOptions()` API to apply the options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

```go
activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  HeartbeatTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

#### WaitForCancellation

If `true` the Activity Execution will finish executing should there be a Cancellation request.

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

```go
activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  WaitForCancellation: false,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

#### OriginalTaskQueueName

```go
activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  OriginalTaskQueueName: "your-original-task-queue-name",
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

#### RetryPolicy

To set a [RetryPolicy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies), create an instance of `ActivityOptions` from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package, set the `RetryPolicy` field, and then use the `WithActivityOptions()` API to apply the options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

- Type: [`RetryPolicy`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal#RetryPolicy)
- Default:

```go
retrypolicy := &temporal.RetryPolicy{
  InitialInterval:    time.Second,
  BackoffCoefficient: 2.0,
  MaximumInterval:    time.Second * 100, // 100 * InitialInterval
  MaximumAttempts:    0, // Unlimited
  NonRetryableErrorTypes: []string, // empty
}
```

Providing a Retry Policy here is a customization that overwrites individual Field defaults.

```go
retrypolicy := &temporal.RetryPolicy{
  InitialInterval:    time.Second,
  BackoffCoefficient: 2.0,
  MaximumInterval:    time.Second * 100,
}

activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  RetryPolicy: retrypolicy,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

### How to get the results of an Activity Execution {#get-activity-results}

The call to spawn an [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution) generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands#scheduleactivitytask) Command and provides the Workflow with an Awaitable.
Workflow Executions can either block progress until the result is available through the Awaitable or continue progressing, making use of the result when it becomes available.

The `ExecuteActivity` API call returns an instance of [`workflow.Future`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Futures) which has the following two methods:

- `Get()`: Takes an instance of the `workflow.Context`, that was passed to the Activity Execution, and a pointer as parameters.
  The variable associated with the pointer is populated with the Activity Execution result.
  This call blocks until the results are available.
- `IsReady()`: Returns `true` when the result of the Activity Execution is ready.

Call the `Get()` method on the instance of `workflow.Future` to get the result of the Activity Execution.
The type of the result parameter must match the type of the return value declared by the Activity function.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
 // ...
 future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
 var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
 if err := future.Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult); err != nil {
   // ...
 }
 // ...
}
```

Use the `IsReady()` method first to make sure the `Get()` call doesn't cause the Workflow Execution to wait on the result.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
 // ...
 future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
 // ...
 if(future.IsReady()) {
   var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
   if err := future.Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult); err != nil {
     // ...
   }
 }
 // ...
}
```

It is idiomatic to invoke multiple Activity Executions from within a Workflow.
Therefore, it is also idiomatic to either block on the results of the Activity Executions or continue on to execute additional logic, checking for the Activity Execution results at a later time.

## How to develop a Worker in Go {#develop-worker}

Create an instance of [`Worker`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#Worker) by calling [`worker.New()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#New), available through the `go.temporal.io/sdk/worker` package, and pass it the following parameters:

1. An instance of the Temporal Go SDK `Client`.
1. The name of the Task Queue that it will poll.
1. An instance of `worker.Options`, which can be empty.

Then, register the Workflow Types and the Activity Types that the Worker will be capable of executing.

Lastly, call either the `Start()` or the `Run()` method on the instance of the Worker.
Run accepts an interrupt channel as a parameter, so that the Worker can be stopped in the terminal.
Otherwise, the `Stop()` method must be called to stop the Worker.

:::tip

If you have [`gow`](https://github.com/mitranim/gow) installed, the Worker Process automatically "reloads" when you update the Worker file:

```bash
go install github.com/mitranim/gow@latest
gow run worker/main.go # automatically reloads when file changes
```

### How to set WorkerOptions in Go {#workeroptions}

Create an instance of [`Options`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#Options) from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/worker` package, set any of the optional fields, and pass the instance to the [`New`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#New) call.

#### MaxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize

Sets the maximum concurrent Activity Executions for the Worker.

- Type: `int`
- Default: `1000`

A value of `0` sets to the default.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
  MaxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize: 1000,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### WorkerActivitiesPerSecond

Rate limits the number of Activity Task Executions started per second for the Worker.

- Type: `float64`
- Default: `100000`

A value of `0` sets to the default.

Intended use case is to limit resources used by the Worker.

Notice that the value type is a float so that the value can be less than 1 if needed.
For example, if set to 0.1, Activity Task Executions will happen once every ten seconds.
This can be used to protect down stream services from flooding with requests.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	WorkerActivitiesPerSecond: 100000,
  // ..
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### MaxConcurrentLocalActivityExecutionSize

Set the maximum concurrent [Local Activity Executions](/activities#local-activity) for the Worker.

- Type: `int`
- Default: `1000`

A value of `0` sets to the default value.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	MaxConcurrentLocalActivityExecutionSize: 1000,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### WorkerLocalActivitiesPerSecond

Rate limits the number of Local Activity Executions per second executed for the Worker.

- Type: `float64`
- Default: `100000`

A value of `0` sets to the default value.

Intended use case is to limit resources used by the Worker.

Notice that the value type is a float so that the value can be less than 1 if needed.
For example, if set to 0.1, Local Activity Task Executions will happen once every ten seconds.
This can be used to protect down stream services from flooding with requests.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	WorkerLocalActivitiesPerSecond: 100000,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### TaskQueueActivitiesPerSecond

Rate limits the number of Activity Executions that can be started per second.

- Type: `float64`
- Default: `100000`

A value of `0` sets to the default value.

This rate is managed by the Temporal Service and limits the Activity Tasks per second for the entire Task Queue. This is in contrast to [`WorkerActivityTasksPerSecond`](#workeractivitiespersecond) controls Activities only per Worker.

Notice that the number is represented in float, so that you can set it to less than 1 if needed.
For example, set the number to 0.1 means you want your Activity to be executed once for every 10 seconds.
This can be used to protect down stream services from flooding.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	TaskQueueActivitiesPerSecond: 100000,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### MaxConcurrentActivityTaskPollers

Sets the maximum number of goroutines to concurrently poll the Task Queue for Activity Tasks.

- Type: `int`
- Default: `2`

Changing this value will affect the rate at which the Worker is able to consume Activity Tasks from the Task Queue.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	MaxConcurrentActivityTaskPollers: 2,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize

Sets the maximum number of concurrent Workflow Task Executions the Worker can have.

- Type: `int`
- Default: `1000`

A value of `0` sets to the default value.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize: 1000,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPollers

Sets the maximum number of goroutines that will concurrently poll the Task Queue for Workflow Tasks.

- Type: `int`
- Default: `2`

Changing this value will affect the rate at which the Worker is able to consume Workflow Tasks from the Task Queue.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPollers: 2,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### EnableLoggingInReplay

Set to enable logging in Workflow Execution replays.

- type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

In Workflow Definitions you can use [`workflow.GetLogger(ctx)`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLogger) to write logs.
By default, the logger will skip logging during replays, so you do not see duplicate logs.

This is only really useful for debugging purpose.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	EnableLoggingInReplay: false,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### DisableStickyExecution

:::caution Deprecated

When DisableStickyExecution is `true` it can harm performance.
It will be removed soon.
See [`SetStickyWorkflowCacheSize`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#SetStickyWorkflowCacheSize) instead.

:::

Set to disable Sticky Executions

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

Sticky Execution runs Workflow Tasks of a Workflow Execution on same host (could be a different Worker, as long as it is on the same host).
This is an optimization for Workflow Executions.
When sticky execution is enabled, Worker keeps the Workflow state in memory.
New Workflow Task contains the new history events will be dispatched to the same Worker.
If this Worker crashes, the sticky Workflow Task will timeout after `StickyScheduleToStartTimeout`, and Temporal Service will clear the stickiness for that Workflow Execution and automatically reschedule a new Workflow Task that is available for any Worker to pick up and resume the progress.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	StickyScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Second(5),
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### StickyScheduleToStartTimeout

Sets the Sticky Execution Schedule-To-Start Timeout for Workflow Tasks.

- Type: [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration)
- Default value is `5`

The resolution is in seconds.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	StickyScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Second(5),
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### BackgroundActivityContext

:::caution Not recommended

This method of passing dependencies between Activity Task Executions is not recommended anymore.

Instead, we recommend using a struct with fields that contain dependencies and develop Activity Definitions as struct methods and then pass all the dependencies on the structure initialization.

- [How to develop an Activity Definition using the Go SDK](#activity-definition)

:::

- Type: [`context.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context)

Sets the background `context.Context` for all Activity Types registered with the Worker.

The context can be used to pass external dependencies such as database connections to Activity Task Executions.

```go
// ...
ctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), "your-key", "your-value")
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	BackgroundActivityContext: ctx,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### WorkflowPanicPolicy

Sets how the Workflow Worker handles a non-deterministic Workflow Execution History Event and other panics from Workflow Definition code.

- Type: [`WorkflowPanicPolicy`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#WorkflowPanicPolicy)
- Default: `BlockWorkflow`

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	DisableStickyExecution: internal.BlockWorkflow,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### WorkerStopTimeout

Sets the Worker's graceful stop timeout

- Type: [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration)
- Default: `0`

Value resolution is in seconds.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	WorkerStopTimeout: time.Second(0),
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### EnableSessionWorker

Enables Sessions for Activity Workers.

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

When `true` the Activity Worker creates a Session to sequentially process Activity Tasks for the given Task Queue.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	EnableSessionWorker: true,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### MaxConcurrentSessionExecutionSize

Sets the maximum number of concurrent Sessions that the Worker can support.

- Type: `int`
- Default: 1000

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	MaxConcurrentSessionExecutionSize: 1000,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### WorkflowInterceptorChainFactories

Specifies the factories used to instantiate the Workflow interceptor chain.

- Type: [`[]WorkflowInterceptor`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#WorkflowInterceptor)

The chain is instantiated for each replay of a Workflow Execution.

#### LocalActivityWorkerOnly

Sets the Worker to only handle Workflow Tasks and local Activity Tasks.

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	LocalActivityWorkerOnly: 1000,
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### Identity

Sets the Temporal Client-level Identity value, overwriting the existing one.

- Type: string
- Default: client identity

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	Identity: "your_custom_identity",
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

#### DeadlockDetectionTimeout

Sets the maximum time that a Workflow Task can execute for.

- Type: [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration)
- Default: 1

Resolution is in seconds.

```go
// ...
workerOptions := worker.Options{
	DeadlockDetectionTimeout: time.Second(1),
  // ...
}
w := worker.New(c, "your_task_queue_name", workerOptions)
// ...
```

## How to run a Temporal Cloud Worker {#run-a-temporal-cloud-worker}

To run a Worker that uses [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), you need to provide additional connection and client options that include the following:

- An address that includes your [Cloud Namespace Name](/namespaces) and a port number: `<Namespace>.<ID>.tmprl.cloud:<port>`.
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates).

For more information about configuring TLS to secure inter- and intra-network communication for a Temporal Service, see [Temporal Customization Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server).

To run a Worker that talks to Temporal Cloud, you need the following:

- A compatible mTLS CA certificate and mTLS private key that has been added to your Namespace.
  See [certificate requirements](/cloud/certificates#certificate-requirements).
- Your [Temporal Cloud Namespace Id](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-namespace-id), which includes your [Temporal Cloud Namespace Name](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-namespace-name) and the unique five- or six-digit [Temporal Cloud Account Id](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-account-id) that is appended to it.
  This information can be found in the URL of your Namespace; for example, `https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces/yournamespace.a2fx6/`.
  Remember that the Namespace Id must include the Account Id: `yournamespace.a2fx6`.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates).

### How to register types {#register-types}

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it fails that Task.
However, the failure of the Task does not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

The `RegisterWorkflow()` and `RegisterActivity()` calls essentially create an in-memory mapping between the Workflow Types and their implementations, inside the Worker process.

**Registering Activity `structs`**

Per [Activity Definition](#activity-definition) best practices, you might have an Activity struct that has multiple methods and fields.
When you use `RegisterActivity()` for an Activity struct, that Worker has access to all exported methods.

**Registering multiple Types**

To register multiple Activity Types and/or Workflow Types with the Worker Entity, just make multiple Activity registration calls, but make sure each Type name is unique:

```go
w.RegisterActivity(ActivityA)
w.RegisterActivity(ActivityB)
w.RegisterActivity(ActivityC)
w.RegisterWorkflow(WorkflowA)
w.RegisterWorkflow(WorkflowB)
w.RegisterWorkflow(WorkflowC)
```

### How to set RegisterWorkflowOptions in Go {#registerworkflowoptions}

Create an instance of [`RegisterOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#RegisterOptions) from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package and pass it to the [`RegisterWorkflowWithOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#WorkflowRegistry) call when registering the Workflow Type with the Worker.

#### Name

See [How to customize a Workflow Type in Go](#customize-workflow-type)

#### DisableAlreadyRegisteredCheck

Disables the check to see if the Workflow Type has already been registered.

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

registerOptions := workflow.RegisterOptions{
  DisableAlreadyRegisteredCheck: `false`,
  // ...
}
w.RegisterWorkflowWithOptions(YourWorkflowDefinition, registerOptions)
// ...
```

### How to set RegisterActivityOptions in Go {#registeractivityoptions}

Create an instance of [`RegisterOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/activity#RegisterOptions) from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/activity` package and pass it to the [`RegisterActivityWithOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#ActivityRegistry) call when registering the Activity Type with the Worker.

Options for registering an Activity

  // ...
}
w.RegisterActivityWithOptions(a.YourActivityDefinition, registerOptions)
// ...
```

#### SkipInvalidStructFunctions

When registering a struct that has Activities, skip functions that are not valid.
If false, registration panics.

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

```go
// ...
w := worker.New(temporalClient, "your_task_queue_name", worker.Options{})
registerOptions := activity.RegisterOptions{
  SkipInvalidStructFunctions: false,
  // ...
}
w.RegisterActivityWithOptions(a.YourActivityDefinition, registerOptions)
