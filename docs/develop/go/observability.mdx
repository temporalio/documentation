description: Monitor your Temporal Application state using Metrics, Tracing, Logging, and Visibility features. Emit metrics, configure tracing, use context propagation, customize logging, and use Search Attributes with the Temporal Go SDK for enhanced Workflow Execution insights.
---

This page covers the many ways to view the current state of your [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application)â€”that is, ways to view which [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution) are tracked by the [Temporal Platform](/temporal#temporal-platform) and the state of any specified Workflow Execution, either currently or at points of an execution.

This section covers features related to viewing the state of the application, including:

- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [Tracing](#tracing-and-context-propogation)
- [Logging](#logging)
- [Visibility](#visibility)

## How to emit metrics {#metrics}

**How to application metrics using the Temporal Go SDK.**

Each Temporal SDK is capable of emitting an optional set of metrics from either the Client or the Worker process.
For a complete list of metrics capable of being emitted, see the [SDK metrics reference](/references/sdk-metrics).

Metrics can be scraped and stored in time series databases, such as:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
- [M3db](https://m3db.io/docs/)
- [statsd](https://github.com/statsd/statsd)

Temporal also provides a dashboard you can integrate with graphing services like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/). For more information, see:

- Temporal's implementation of the [Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards)
- [How to export metrics in Grafana](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts#exploring-metrics-via-grafana)

To emit metrics from the Temporal Client in Go, create a [metrics handler](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal/common/metrics#Handler) from the [Client Options](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ClientOptions) and specify a listener address to be used by Prometheus.

```go
client.Options{
		MetricsHandler: sdktally.NewMetricsHandler(newPrometheusScope(prometheus.Configuration{
			ListenAddress: "0.0.0.0:9090",
			TimerType:     "histogram",
		}
```

The Go SDK currently supports the [Tally](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/tally) library; however, Tally offers [extensible custom metrics reporting](https://github.com/uber-go/tally#report-your-metrics), which is exposed through the [`WithCustomMetricsReporter`](/references/server-options#withcustommetricsreporter) API.

For more information, see the [Go sample for metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/metrics).

## Tracing and Context Propagation {#tracing-and-context-propogation}

The Temporal Go SDK supports three tracing implementations: [Datadog](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/datadog), [OpenTelemetry](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/opentelemetry), and [OpenTracing](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/opentracing).

Tracing allows you to view the call graph of a Workflow along with its Activities and any Child Workflows.

Tracing can be configured by providing a tracer implementation in [ClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions) during client instantiation.

For details on how to configure and leverage tracing, see the respective documentation:

- [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io)
- [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/)

The OpenTracing support has been validated using Jaeger, but other implementations should also work.
Tracing functionality utilizes generic context propagation provided by the client.

### Context Propagation

Temporal provides a standard way to propagate a custom context across a Workflow.
You can configure a context propagator in via the [ClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions).
The context propagator extracts and passes on information present in `context.Context` and `workflow.Context` objects across the Workflow.
Once a context propagator is configured, you should be able to access the required values in the context objects as you would normally do in Go.
You can see how the Go SDK implements a [tracing context propagator](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/ctxpropagation).

#### Server-Side Headers

On the server side, Temporal provides a mechanism for propagating context across Workflow transitions called headers.

```proto
message Header {
    map<string, Payload> fields = 1;
}
```

`Client` leverages headers to pass around additional context information.
[HeaderReader](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#HeaderReader) and [HeaderWriter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#HeaderWriter) are interfaces that allow reading and writing to the Temporal Server headers.
The SDK includes [implementations](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/internal/headers.go) for these interfaces.
`HeaderWriter` sets a value for a header.
Headers are held as a map, so setting a value for the same key will overwrite its previous value.
`HeaderReader` gets a value of a header.
It also can iterate through all headers and execute the provided handler function on each header, so that your code can operate on select headers you need.

```go
type HeaderWriter interface {
	Set(string, *commonpb.Payload)
}

type HeaderReader interface {
	Get(string) (*commonpb.Payload, bool)
	ForEachKey(handler func(string, *commonpb.Payload) error) error
}
```

#### Context Propagators

You can propagate additional context through Workflow Execution by using a context propagator.
A context propagator needs to implement the `ContextPropagator` interface that includes the following four methods:

```go
type ContextPropagator interface {
  Inject(context.Context, HeaderWriter) error

  Extract(context.Context, HeaderReader) (context.Context, error)

  InjectFromWorkflow(Context, HeaderWriter) error

  ExtractToWorkflow(Context, HeaderReader) (Context, error)
}
```

- `Inject` reads select context keys from a Go [context.Context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/#Context) object and writes them into the headers using the [HeaderWriter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#HeaderWriter) interface.
- `InjectFromWorkflow` operates similar to `Inject` but reads from a [workflow.Context](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#Context) object.
- `Extract` picks select headers and put their values into the [context.Context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/#Context) object.
- `ExtractToWorkflow` operates similar to `Extract` but write to a [workflow.Context](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#Context) object.

The [tracing context propagator](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/ctxpropagation) shows a sample implementation of a context propagator.

#### Is there a complete example?

The [context propagation sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/master/ctxpropagation/) configures a custom context propagator and shows context propagation of custom keys across a Workflow and an Activity.
It also uses Jaeger for tracing.

#### Can I configure multiple context propagators?

Yes. Multiple context propagators help to structure code with each propagator having its own scope of responsibility.

### Useful Resources

- [Passing Context with Temporal](https://spiralscout.com/blog/passing-context-with-temporal) by SpiralScout

The [Go SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go) provides support for distributed tracing with **_Interceptors_**.
Interceptors uses Temporal headers to create a call graph of a [Workflow](/workflows), along with its [Activities](/activities) and [Child Workflows](/encyclopedia/child-workflows).

There are several tracing implementations supported by the Temporal Go SDK.
For an [OpenTracing](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/opentracing) Interceptor, use `opentracing.NewInterceptor(opentracing.TracerOptions{})` to create a `TracingInterceptor`.

```go
// create Interceptor
tracingInterceptor, err := opentracing.NewInterceptor(opentracing.TracerOptions{})
```

For an [OpenTelemetry](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/opentelemetry) Interceptor, use `opentelemetry.NewTracingInterceptor(opentelemetry.TracerOptions{})`.

```go
// create Interceptor
tracingInterceptor, err := opentelemetry.NewTracingInterceptor(opentelemetry.TracerOptions{})
```

For a [Datadog](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/datadog/tracing) Interceptor, use `tracing.NewTracingInterceptor(tracing.TracerOptions{})`.

```go
// create Interceptor
tracingInterceptor, err := tracing.NewTracingInterceptor(tracing.TracerOptions{})
```

Pass the newly created Interceptor to [ClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions) to enable tracing.

```go
c, err := client.Dial(client.Options{
  Interceptors:       []interceptor.ClientInterceptor{tracingInterceptor},
})
```

OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry are natively supported by [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.46/features/#native-support-for-opentracing-and-opentelemetry).
For more information on configuring and using tracing, see the documentation provided by [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io), [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), and [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/).

## Log from a Workflow {#logging}

**How to log from a Workflow using the Go SDK.**

Send logs and errors to a logging service, so that when things go wrong, you can see what happened.

The SDK core uses `WARN` for its default logging level.

In Workflow Definitions you can use [`workflow.GetLogger(ctx)`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLogger) to write logs.

```go
import (
	"context"
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/activity"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

// Workflow is a standard workflow definition.
// Note that the Workflow and Activity don't need to care that
// their inputs/results are being compressed.
func Workflow(ctx workflow.Context, name string) (string, error) {
// ...

workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)

// Getting the logger from the context.
	logger := workflow.GetLogger(ctx)
// Logging a message with the key value pair `name` and `name`
	logger.Info("Compressed Payloads workflow started", "name", name)

	info := map[string]string{
		"name": name,
	}

	logger.Info("Compressed Payloads workflow completed.", "result", result)

	return result, nil
}
```

### Provide a custom logger {#custom-logger}

**How to provide a custom logger to the Temporal Client using the Go SDK.**

This field sets a custom Logger that is used for all logging actions of the instance of the Temporal Client.

Although the Go SDK does not support most third-party logging solutions natively, [our friends at Banzai Cloud](https://github.com/sagikazarmark) built the adapter package [logur](https://github.com/logur/logur) which makes it possible to use third party loggers with minimal overhead.
Most of the popular logging solutions have existing adapters in Logur, but you can find a full list [in the Logur Github project](https://github.com/logur?q=adapter-).

Here is an example of using Logur to support [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus):

```go
package main
import (
  "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"

	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
	logrusadapter "logur.dev/adapter/logrus"
	"logur.dev/logur"
)

func main() {
  // ...
  logger := logur.LoggerToKV(logrusadapter.New(logrus.New()))
  clientOptions := client.Options{
    Logger: logger,
  }
  temporalClient, err := client.Dial(clientOptions)
  // ...
}
```

## Visibility APIs {#visibility}

The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Temporal Service.

### Search Attributes {#search-attributes}

**How to use Search Attributes using the Go SDK.**

The typical method of retrieving a Workflow Execution is by its Workflow Id.

However, sometimes you'll want to retrieve one or more Workflow Executions based on another property. For example, imagine you want to get all Workflow Executions of a certain type that have failed within a time range, so that you can start new ones with the same arguments.

You can do this with [Search Attributes](/visibility#search-attribute).

- [Default Search Attributes](/visibility#default-search-attributes) like `WorkflowType`, `StartTime` and `ExecutionStatus` are automatically added to Workflow Executions.
- _Custom Search Attributes_ can contain their own domain-specific data (like `customerId` or `numItems`).
  - A few [generic Custom Search Attributes](/visibility#custom-search-attributes) like `CustomKeywordField` and `CustomIntField` are created by default in Temporal's [Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose).

The steps to using custom Search Attributes are:

- Create a new Search Attribute in your Temporal Service using `temporal operator search-attribute create` or the Cloud UI.
- Set the value of the Search Attribute for a Workflow Execution:
  - On the Client by including it as an option when starting the Execution.
  - In the Workflow by calling `UpsertSearchAttributes`.
- Read the value of the Search Attribute:
  - On the Client by calling `DescribeWorkflow`.
  - In the Workflow by looking at `WorkflowInfo`.
- Query Workflow Executions by the Search Attribute using a [List Filter](/visibility#list-filter):
  - [In the Temporal CLI](/cli/workflow#list).
  - In code by calling `ListWorkflowExecutions`.

Here is how to query Workflow Executions:

The [ListWorkflow()](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client.ListWorkflow) function retrieves a list of [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution) that match the [Search Attributes](/visibility#search-attribute) of a given [List Filter](/visibility#list-filter).
The metadata returned from the [Visibility](/clusters#visibility) store can be used to get a Workflow Execution's history and details from the [Persistence](/clusters#persistence) store.

Use a List Filter to define a `request` to pass into `ListWorkflow()`.

```go
request := &workflowservice.ListWorkflowExecutionsRequest{ Query: "CloseTime = missing" }
```

This `request` value returns only open Workflows.
For more List Filter examples, see the [examples provided for List Filters in the Temporal Visibility guide.](/visibility#list-filter-examples)

```go
resp, err := temporalClient.ListWorkflow(ctx.Background(), request)
if err != nil {
  return err
}

fmt.Println("First page of results:")
for _, exec := range resp.Executions {
  fmt.Printf("Workflow ID %v\n", exec.Execution.WorkflowId)
}
```

### Set custom Search Attributes {#custom-search-attributes}

**How to set custom Search Attributes using the Go SDK.**

After you've created custom Search Attributes in your Temporal Service (using the `temporal operator search-attribute create` command or the Cloud UI), you can set the values of the custom Search Attributes when starting a Workflow.

Provide key-value pairs in [`StartWorkflowOptions.SearchAttributes`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#StartWorkflowOptions).

Search Attributes are represented as `map[string]interface{}`.
The values in the map must correspond to the [Search Attribute's value type](/visibility#supported-types):

- Bool = `bool`
- Datetime = `time.Time`
- Double = `float64`
- Int = `int64`
- Keyword = `string`
- Text = `string`

If you had custom Search Attributes `CustomerId` of type Keyword and `MiscData` of type Text, you would provide `string` values:

```go
func (c *Client) CallYourWorkflow(ctx context.Context, workflowID string, payload map[string]interface{}) error {
    // ...
    searchAttributes := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomerId": payload["customer"],
        "MiscData": payload["miscData"]
    }
    options := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
        SearchAttributes:   searchAttributes
        // ...
    }
    we, err := c.Client.ExecuteWorkflow(ctx, options, app.YourWorkflow, payload)
    // ...
}
```

### Upsert Search Attributes {#upsert-search-attributes}

**How to upsert Search Attributes using the Go SDK.**

You can upsert Search Attributes to add or update Search Attributes from within Workflow code.

In advanced cases, you may want to dynamically update these attributes as the Workflow progresses.
[UpsertSearchAttributes](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#UpsertSearchAttributes) is used to add or update Search Attributes from within Workflow code.

`UpsertSearchAttributes` will merge attributes to the existing map in the Workflow.
Consider this example Workflow code:

```go
func YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, input string) error {

    attr1 := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomIntField": 1,
        "CustomBoolField": true,
    }
    workflow.UpsertSearchAttributes(ctx, attr1)

    attr2 := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomIntField": 2,
        "CustomKeywordField": "seattle",
    }
    workflow.UpsertSearchAttributes(ctx, attr2)
}
```

After the second call to `UpsertSearchAttributes`, the map will contain:

```go
map[string]interface{}{
    "CustomIntField": 2, // last update wins
    "CustomBoolField": true,
    "CustomKeywordField": "seattle",
}
```

### Remove a Search Attribute from a Workflow {#remove-search-attribute}

**How to remove a Search Attribute from a Workflow using the Go SDK.**

To remove a Search Attribute that was previously set, set it to an empty array: `[]`.

**There is no support for removing a field.**

However, to achieve a similar effect, set the field to some placeholder value.
For example, you could set `CustomKeywordField` to `impossibleVal`.
Then searching `CustomKeywordField != 'impossibleVal'` will match Workflows with `CustomKeywordField` not equal to `impossibleVal`, which includes Workflows without the `CustomKeywordField` set.
