You can use a debugger tool provided by your favorite IDE to debug your Workflow Definitions prior to testing or executing them.

The Temporal Go SDK includes deadlock detection which fails a Workflow Task in case the code blocks over a second without relinquishing execution control.
Because of this you can often encounter a `PanicError: Potential deadlock detected` while stepping through Workflow Definitions during debugging.

To alleviate this issue, you can set the `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` environment variable to `true` before debugging your Workflow Definition.

:::note

Make sure to set `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` to true only during debugging.

## How to debug in a development environment {#debug-in-a-development-environment}

In addition to the normal development tools of logging and a debugger, you can also see what's happening in your Workflow by using the [Web UI](/web-ui) or [Temporal CLI](/cli).

## How to debug in a production environment {#debug-in-a-production-environment}

You can debug production Workflows using:

- [Web UI](/web-ui)
- [Temporal CLI](/cli)
- [Replay](/develop/go/testing-suite#replay)
- [Tracing](/develop/go/observability#tracing-and-context-propogation)
- [Logging](/develop/go/observability#logging)

You can debug and tune Worker performance with metrics and the [Worker performance guide](/develop/worker-performance).
For more information, see [Metrics](/develop/go/observability#metrics) for setting up SDK metrics.

Debug Server performance with [Cloud metrics](/cloud/metrics/) or [self-hosted Server metrics](/self-hosted-guide/production-checklist#scaling-and-metrics).

## How to test Workflow Definitions in Go {#testing-and-debugging}

The Temporal Go SDK provides a test framework to facilitate testing Workflow implementations.

This framework is suited for implementing unit tests as well as functional tests of the Workflow logic.

The following code implements unit tests for the `SimpleWorkflow` sample:

```go
package sample

import (
        "context"
        "errors"
        "testing"

        "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"
        "github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"

        "go.temporal.io/sdk/activity"
        "go.temporal.io/sdk/testsuite"
)

type UnitTestSuite struct {
        suite.Suite
        testsuite.WorkflowTestSuite

        env *testsuite.TestWorkflowEnvironment
}

func (s *UnitTestSuite) SetupTest() {
        s.env = s.NewTestWorkflowEnvironment()
}

func (s *UnitTestSuite) AfterTest(suiteName, testName string) {
        s.env.AssertExpectations(s.T())
}

func (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_Success() {
        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, "test_success")

        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())
        s.NoError(s.env.GetWorkflowError())
}

func (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_ActivityParamCorrect() {
        s.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(
          func(ctx context.Context, value string) (string, error) {
                s.Equal("test_success", value)
                return value, nil
        })
        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, "test_success")

        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())
        s.NoError(s.env.GetWorkflowError())
}

func (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_ActivityFails() {
        s.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(
          "", errors.New("SimpleActivityFailure"))
        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, "test_failure")

        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())

        err := s.env.GetWorkflowError()
        s.Error(err)
        var applicationErr *temporal.ApplicationError
        s.True(errors.As(err, &applicationErr))
        s.Equal("SimpleActivityFailure", applicationErr.Error())
}

func TestUnitTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
        suite.Run(t, new(UnitTestSuite))
}
```

#### Setup

To run unit tests, we first define a test suite struct that absorbs both the
basic suite functionality from [testify](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite)
via `suite.Suite` and the suite functionality from the Temporal test framework via
`testsuite.WorkflowTestSuite`. Because every test in this test suite will test our Workflow, we
add a property to our struct to hold an instance of the test environment. This allows us to initialize
the test environment in a setup method. For testing Workflows, we use a `testsuite.TestWorkflowEnvironment`.

Next, we implement a `SetupTest` method to set up a new test environment before each test. Doing so
ensures that each test runs in its own isolated sandbox. We also implement an `AfterTest` function
where we assert that all the mocks we set up were indeed called by invoking `s.env.AssertExpectations(s.T())`.

Timeout for the entire test can be set using `SetTestTimeout` in the Workflow or Activity environment.

Finally, we create a regular test function recognized by the `go test` command, and pass the struct to `suite.Run`.

#### A Simple Test

The simplest test case we can write is to have the test environment execute the Workflow and then
evaluate the results.

```go
func (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_Success() {
        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, "test_success")

        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())
        s.NoError(s.env.GetWorkflowError())
}
```

Calling `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` executes the Workflow logic and any invoked Activities inside the
test process. The first parameter of `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` contains the Workflow functions,
and any subsequent parameters contain values for custom input parameters declared by the Workflow
function.

> Note that unless the Activity invocations are mocked or Activity implementation
> replaced (see [Activity mocking and overriding](#activity-mocking-and-overriding)), the test environment
> will execute the actual Activity code including any calls to outside services.

After executing the Workflow in the above example, we assert that the Workflow ran through completion
via the call to `s.env.IsWorkflowComplete()`. We also assert that no errors were returned by asserting
on the return value of `s.env.GetWorkflowError()`. If our Workflow returned a value, we could have
retrieved that value via a call to `s.env.GetWorkflowResult(&value)` and had additional asserts on that
value.

#### Activity mocking and overriding

When running unit tests on Workflows, we want to test the Workflow logic in isolation. Additionally,
we want to inject Activity errors during our test runs. The test framework provides two mechanisms
that support these scenarios: Activity mocking and Activity overriding. Both of these mechanisms allow
you to change the behavior of Activities invoked by your Workflow without the need to modify the actual
Workflow code.

Let's take a look at a test that simulates a test that fails via the "Activity mocking" mechanism.

```go
func (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_ActivityFails() {
        s.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(
          "", errors.New("SimpleActivityFailure"))
        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, "test_failure")

        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())

        err := s.env.GetWorkflowError()
        s.Error(err)
        var applicationErr *temporal.ApplicationError
        s.True(errors.As(err, &applicationErr))
        s.Equal("SimpleActivityFailure", applicationErr.Error())
}
```

This test simulates the execution of the Activity `SimpleActivity` that is invoked by our Workflow
`SimpleWorkflow` returning an error. We accomplish this by setting up a mock on the test environment
for the `SimpleActivity` that returns an error.

```go
s.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(
  "", errors.New("SimpleActivityFailure"))
```

With the mock set up we can now execute the Workflow via the `s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(...)` method and
assert that the Workflow completed successfully and returned the expected error.

Simply mocking the execution to return a desired value or error is a pretty powerful mechanism to
isolate Workflow logic. However, sometimes we want to replace the Activity with an alternate implementation
to support a more complex test scenario. Let's assume we want to validate that the Activity gets called
with the correct parameters.

```go
func (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_SimpleWorkflow_ActivityParamCorrect() {
        s.env.OnActivity(SimpleActivity, mock.Anything, mock.Anything).Return(
          func(ctx context.Context, value string) (string, error) {
                s.Equal("test_success", value)
                return value, nil
        })
        s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(SimpleWorkflow, "test_success")

        s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())
        s.NoError(s.env.GetWorkflowError())
}
```

In this example, we provide a function implementation as the parameter to `Return`. This allows us to
provide an alternate implementation for the Activity `SimpleActivity`. The framework will execute this
function whenever the Activity is invoked and pass on the return value from the function as the result
of the Activity invocation. Additionally, the framework will validate that the signature of the "mock"
function matches the signature of the original Activity function.

Since this can be an entire function, there is no limitation as to what we can do here. In this
example, we assert that the `value` param has the same content as the value param we passed to the Workflow.

#### Queries

`TestWorkflowEnvironment` instances have a [`QueryWorkflow()` method](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/temporal/internal#TestWorkflowEnvironment.QueryWorkflow) that lets you query the state of the currently running Workflow.
For example, suppose you have a Workflow that lets you query the progress of a long running task as shown below.

```go
func ProgressWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, percent int) error {
	logger := workflow.GetLogger(ctx)

	err := workflow.SetQueryHandler(ctx, "getProgress", func(input []byte) (int, error) {
		return percent, nil
	})
	if err != nil {
		logger.Info("SetQueryHandler failed.", "Error", err)
		return err
	}

	for percent = 0; percent<100; percent++ {
                // Important! Use `workflow.Sleep()`, not `time.Sleep()`, because Temporal's
                // test environment doesn't stub out `time.Sleep()`.
		workflow.Sleep(ctx, time.Second*1)
	}

	return nil
}
```

This Workflow tracks the current progress of a task in percentage terms, and increments the percentage by 1 every second.
Below is how you would write a test case that queries this Workflow.
Note that you should always query the Workflow either after `ExecuteWorkflow()` is done or in a `RegisterDelayedCallback()` callback, otherwise you'll get a `runtime error` panic.

```go
func (s *UnitTestSuite) Test_ProgressWorkflow() {
	value := 0

	// After 10 seconds plus padding, progress should be 10.
	// Note that `RegisterDelayedCallback()` doesn't actually make your test wait for 10 seconds!
	// Temporal's test framework advances time internally, so this test should take < 1 second.
	s.env.RegisterDelayedCallback(func() {
		res, err := s.env.QueryWorkflow("getProgress")
		s.NoError(err)
		err = res.Get(&value)
		s.NoError(err)
		s.Equal(10, value)
	}, time.Second*10+time.Millisecond*1)

	s.env.ExecuteWorkflow(ProgressWorkflow, 0)

	s.True(s.env.IsWorkflowCompleted())

	// Once the workflow is completed, progress should always be 100
	res, err := s.env.QueryWorkflow("getProgress")
	s.NoError(err)
	err = res.Get(&value)
	s.NoError(err)
	s.Equal(value, 100)
}
```

:::note

`RegisterDelayedCallback` can also be used to send [Signals](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#sending-signals).
When using "Signal-With-Start", set the delay to `0`.

#### Debugging

You can use a debugger tool provided by your favorite IDE to debug your Workflow Definitions prior to testing or executing them.

The Temporal Go SDK includes deadlock detection which fails a Workflow Task in case the code blocks over a second without relinquishing execution control.
Because of this you can often encounter a `PanicError: Potential deadlock detected` while stepping through Workflow Definitions during debugging.

To alleviate this issue, you can set the `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` environment variable to `true` before debugging your Workflow Definition.

:::note

Make sure to set `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` to true only during debugging.
