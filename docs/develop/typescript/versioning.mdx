The Temporal Platform requires that Workflow code is [deterministic](/workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints).
Because of that requirement, the Temporal TypeScript SDK offers two dedicated versioning features.

- [Workflow Patching APIs](#patching)
- [Worker Versioning](#worker-versioning)

### Alternatives

Before you explore dedicated versioning features, check whether your needs can be addressed in other ways:

- [Version Task Queue](#version-task-queue)
- [Version Workflow Name](#version-workflow-name)

Both options mean that Workflows running `v1` code will never migrate to `v2` code; they will run `v1` code to completion.
If you would like to update Workflows running `v1` _while they are still running,_ you [might need to "patch in" code](#do-i-need-to-patch).

#### Version Task Queue

If you're currently running v1 Workflow code on Workers that poll on `queue1`, you can run v2 Workflow code on Workers that poll on `queue2`:

1. Leave some Workers running your v1 `Workflow`, on the `queue1` Task Queue.
1. Change your `Workflow` code and spin up new Workers that are polling a `queue2` Task Queue.
1. Cut over your Clients to only call `Workflow` on `queue2` from now on.
1. Remove your v1 Workers when all the v1 Workflows have completed.

#### Version Workflow Name

Although versioning the Task Queue is usually easier, we can also create a new version of a Workflow by copying it and changing its name:

1. Copy the `Workflow1` code to a `Workflow2` function and change what you need.
1. Register `Workflow2` in your Workers alongside `Workflow1`.
1. Cut over your Clients to only call `Workflow2` from now on.
1. Remove `Workflow1` code when none of them are running anymore.

## How to patch Workflow code in TypeScript {#patching}

The TypeScript SDK Patching API lets you change Workflow Definitions without causing [non-deterministic behavior](/workflow-definition#non-deterministic-change) in current long-running Workflows.

### Do I need to Patch?

You may need to patch if:

- You want to change the remaining logic of a Workflow while it is still running
- If your new logic can result in a different execution path

This added `sleep()` can result in a different execution path:

```ts
// from v1
export async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {
  await runActivity();
  return 7;
}

// to v2
export async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {
  await sleep('1 day');

  await runActivity();
  return 7;
}
```

If v2 is deployed while there's a Workflow on the `runActivity` step, when the Activity completes, the Worker will try to replay the Workflow (in order to continue Workflow execution), notice that the sleep command is called and doesn't match with the Workflow's Event History, and throw a non-determinism error.

Adding a Signal Handler for a Signal type that has never been sent before does not need patching:

```ts
// from v1
export async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {
  await sleep('1 days');
  return value;
}

// to v2
const updateValueSignal = defineSignal<[number]>('updateValue');

export async function yourWorkflow(value: number): Promise<number> {
  setHandler(updateValueSignal, (newValue) => (value = newValue));

  await sleep('1 days');
  return value;
}
```

### Migrating Workflows in Patches

Workflow code has to be [deterministic](/workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints) by taking the same code path when replaying History Events.
Any Workflow code change that affects the order in which commands are generated breaks this assumption.

So we have to keep both the old and new code when migrating Workflows while they are still running:

- When replaying, use the original code version that generated the ongoing event history.
- When executing a new code path, always execute the
  new code.

Because we design for potentially long-running Workflows at scale, versioning with Temporal works differently than with other Workflow systems.

### TypeScript SDK Patching API

In principle, the TypeScript SDK's patching mechanism works in a similar "feature-flag" fashion to the other SDKs; however, the "versioning" API has been updated to a notion of "patching in" code.
There are three steps to this reflecting three stages of migration:

- Running v1 code with vFinal patched in concurrently
- Running vFinal code with deprecation markers for vFinal patches
- Running "just" vFinal code.

This is best explained in sequence (click through to follow along using our SDK sample).

Given an initial Workflow version `v1`:

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-1-->

[patching-api/src/workflows-v1.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/patching-api/src/workflows-v1.ts)

```ts
// v1
export async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {
  await activityA();
  await sleep('1 days'); // arbitrary long sleep to simulate a long running workflow we need to patch
  await activityThatMustRunAfterA();
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

We decide to update our code and run `activityB` instead.
This is our desired end state, `vFinal`.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-final-->

[patching-api/src/workflows-vFinal.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/patching-api/src/workflows-vFinal.ts)

```ts
// vFinal
export async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {
  await activityB();
  await sleep('1 days');
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

**Problem: We cannot directly deploy `vFinal` until we know for sure there are no more running Workflows created using `v1` code.**

Instead we must deploy `v2` (below) and use the [`patched`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#patched) function to check which version of the code should be executed.

Patching is a three-step process:

1. Patch in new code with `patched` and run it alongside old code
2. Remove old code and `deprecatePatch`
3. When you are sure all old Workflows are done executing, remove `deprecatePatch`

#### Step 1: Patch in new code

`patched` inserts a marker into the Workflow history.

<CaptionedImage
    src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/139673361-35d61b38-ab94-401e-ae7b-feaa52eae8c6.png"
    title="`patched` inserts a marker into the Workflow history."
    zoom="true"
/>

During replay, when a Worker picks up a history with that marker it will fail the Workflow task when running Workflow code that does not emit the same patch marker (in this case `your-change-id`); therefore it is safe to deploy code from `v2` in a "feature flag" alongside the original version (`v1`).

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-2-->

[patching-api/src/workflows-v2.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/patching-api/src/workflows-v2.ts)

```ts
// v2
import { patched } from '@temporalio/workflow';
export async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {
  if (patched('my-change-id')) {
    await activityB();
    await sleep('1 days');
  } else {
    await activityA();
    await sleep('1 days');
    await activityThatMustRunAfterA();
  }
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

#### Step 2: Deprecate patch

When we know that all Workflows started with `v1` code have completed, we can [deprecate the patch](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#deprecatepatch).
Deprecated patches bridge between `v2` and `vFinal` (the end result).
They work similarly to regular patches by recording a marker in the Workflow history.
This marker does not fail replay when Workflow code does not emit it.

If while we're deploying `v3` (below) there are still live Workers running `v2` code and those Workers pick up Workflow histories generated by `v3`, they will safely use the patched branch.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-3-->

[patching-api/src/workflows-v3.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/patching-api/src/workflows-v3.ts)

```ts
// v3
import { deprecatePatch } from '@temporalio/workflow';

export async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {
  deprecatePatch('my-change-id');
  await activityB();
  await sleep('1 days');
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

#### Step 3: Solely deploy new code

`vFinal` is safe to deploy once all `v2` or earlier Workflows are complete due to the assertion mentioned above.

#### Detailed Description of the Patched Function

Here is a detailed explanation of how the `patched()` function behaves.

##### Behavior When Not Replaying

If the execution is not replaying, when it encounters a call to `patched()`, it first checks the event history.

- If the patch ID is not in the event history, the execution adds a marker to the event history, upserts a search attribute, and returns `true`.
  This happens in the first block of the patch ID.
- If the patch ID is in the event history, the execution doesn't modify the history, and returns `true`.
  This happens in a patch ID's subsequent blocks, because the event history was updated in the first block.

##### Behavior When Replaying With Marker Before-Or-At Current Location

If Replaying:

- If the code has a call to patched, and if the event history
  has a marker from a call to patched in the same place (which means it
  will match the original event history), then
  it writes a marker to the replay event history and returns true.
  _This is similar to the behavior of the non-replay case, and
  just like in that case, this happens in a given patch ID's first block_
- If the code has a call to patched, and the event history
  has a marker with that Patch ID earlier in the history,
  then it will simply return true and not modify the
  replay event history.
  _This is similar to the behavior of the non-replay case, and
  just like in that case, this happens in a given patch ID's subsequent blocks_
- If the code has a call to patched, and there no marker on or before that spot in the execution, it returns false.

If the execution is replaying and has a call to `patched()`, and if the event history has a marker from a call to `patched()` in the same place
(which means it will match the original event history), then it writes a marker to the replay event history and returns `true`.

This is similar to the behavior of the non-replay case, and
also happens in a given patch ID's first block.

If the code has a call to `patched()`, and the event history
has a marker with that Patch ID earlier in the history,
it will return `true` and will not modify the
replay event history.

This is also similar to the behavior of the non-replay case, and
also happens in a given patch ID's subsequent blocks.

If the code has a call to `patched()`, and there is no marker on or before that spot in the execution, it returns `false`.

##### Implications of the Behaviors

If you deploy new code and the execution is not replaying, the new code will be run.
If the execution is replaying, it will repeat what
it did the previous time.

This means that if the execution has gotten through some of your code, then
you stop the worker and deploy new code, when it replays,
it will use the old code throughout the replay, but switch over
to new code after it has passed the replay threshold. This means
your new code and your old code must work together. For example,
if your Workflow Definition originally looked like this:

```ts
console.log('original code before the sleep');
await sleep(10000); // <-- Stop the Worker while this is waiting, and deploy the new code below
console.log('original code after the sleep');
```

If you stop the Worker during the `sleep`, and wrap the original
code in the `else` part of a patched `if` statement:

```ts
if (patched('my-change-id')) {
  console.log('new code before the sleep');
} else {
  console.log('original code before the sleep'); // this will run
}
await sleep(10000);
if (patched('my-change-id')) {
  console.log('new code after the sleep'); // this will run
} else {
  console.log('original code after the sleep');
}
```

When you start the worker again, the execution will initially be replaying and will run the old code, up to the `sleep` call.
After the `sleep` call, the execution won't be replaying, and will run the new code.

##### Recommendations

Based on this behavior and the implications, when patching in new code, always put the newest code at the top of an if-patched-block.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-example-->

```ts
if (patched('v3')) {
  // This is the newest version of the code.
  // put this at the top, so when it is running
  // a fresh execution and not replaying,
  // this patched statement will return true
  // and it will run the new code.
} else if (patched('v2')) {
} else {
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

The following sample shows how `patched()` will behave in a conditional block that's arranged differently.
In this case, the code's conditional block doesn't have the newest code at the top.
Because `patched()` will return `true` when not Replaying, this snippet will run the `v2` branch instead of `v3` in new executions.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-patching-anti-example-->

```ts
if (patched('v2')) {
  // This is bad because when doing a new execution (i.e. not replaying),
  // patched statements evaluate to True (and put a marker
  // in the event history), which means that new executions
  // will use v2, and miss v3 below
} else if (patched('v3')) {}
else {}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

### Best Practice of Using TypeScript Objects as Arguments and Returns

As a side note on the Patching API, its behavior is why Temporal recommends using single objects as arguments and returns from Signals, Queries, Updates, and Activities, rather than using multiple arguments.
The Patching API's main use case is to support branching in an `if` block of a function body.
It is not designed to be used to set different functions or function signatures for different Workflow Versions.

Because of this, Temporal recommends that each Signal, Activity, etc, accepts a single object and returns a single object, so the function signature can stay constant, and you can do your versioning logic using `patched()` within the function body.

### Upgrading Workflow dependencies

Upgrading Workflow dependencies (such as ones installed into `node_modules`) _might_ break determinism in unpredictable ways.
We recommended using a lock file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to fix Workflow dependency versions and gain control of when they're updated.

## How to use Worker Versioning in TypeScript {#worker-versioning}

This feature is coming soon!

For now, please join #safe-deploys in our [Community Slack](https://temporal.io/slack) to find the latest status and pre-release docs.

If you were using a previous pre-release version of Worker Versioning, it's now deprecated.

See [Legacy Worker Versioning](worker-versioning-legacy) if you still need those docs.
