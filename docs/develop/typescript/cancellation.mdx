description: Explore the power of Cancellation Scopes in TypeScript to manage nested, non-cancellable, and timeout-based operations within Temporal Workflows with ease.
---

## Cancellation scopes in Typescript {#cancellation-scopes}

In the TypeScript SDK, Workflows are represented internally by a tree of cancellation scopes, each with cancellation behaviors you can specify.
By default, everything runs in the "root" scope.

Scopes are created using the [CancellationScope](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope) constructor or one of three static helpers:

- [cancellable(fn)](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope#cancellable-1): Children are automatically cancelled when their containing scope is cancelled.
  - Equivalent to `new CancellationScope().run(fn)`.
- [nonCancellable(fn)](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope#noncancellable): Cancellation does not propagate to children.
  - Equivalent to `new CancellationScope({ cancellable: false }).run(fn)`.
- [withTimeout(timeoutMs, fn)](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.CancellationScope#withtimeout): If a timeout triggers before `fn` resolves, the scope is cancelled, triggering cancellation of any enclosed operations, such as Activities and Timers.
  - Equivalent to `new CancellationScope({ cancellable: true, timeout: timeoutMs }).run(fn)`.

Cancellations are applied to cancellation scopes, which can encompass an entire Workflow or just part of one.
Scopes can be nested, and cancellation propagates from outer scopes to inner ones.
A Workflow's `main` function runs in the outermost scope.
Cancellations are handled by catching `CancelledFailure`s thrown by cancelable operations.

`CancellationScope.run()` and the static helpers mentioned earlier return native JavaScript promises, so you can use the familiar Promise APIs like `Promise.all` and `Promise.race` to model your asynchronous logic.
You can also use the following APIs:

- `CancellationScope.current()`: Get the current scope.
- `scope.cancel()`: Cancel all operations inside a `scope`.
- `scope.run(fn)`: Run an async function within a `scope` and return the result of `fn`.
- `scope.cancelRequested`: A promise that resolves when a scope cancellation is requested, such as when Workflow code calls `cancel()` or the entire Workflow is cancelled by an external client.

When a `CancellationScope` is cancelled, it propagates cancellation in any child scopes and of any cancelable operations created within it, such as the following:

- Activities
- Timers (created with the [sleep](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#sleep) function)
- [Triggers](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.Trigger)

### CancelledFailure

Timers and triggers throw [CancelledFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.CancelledFailure) when cancelled; Activities and Child Workflows throw `ActivityFailure` and `ChildWorkflowFailure` with cause set to `CancelledFailure`.
One exception is when an Activity or Child Workflow is scheduled in an already cancelled scope (or Workflow).
In this case, they propagate the `CancelledFailure` that was thrown to cancel the scope.

To simplify checking for cancellation, use the [isCancellation(err)](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#iscancellation) function.

### Internal cancellation example

[packages/test/src/workflows/cancel-timer-immediately.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/packages/test/src/workflows/cancel-timer-immediately.ts)

```ts
import {
  CancellationScope,
  CancelledFailure,
  sleep,
} from '@temporalio/workflow';

export async function cancelTimer(): Promise<void> {
  // Timers and Activities are automatically cancelled when their containing scope is cancelled.
  try {
    await CancellationScope.cancellable(async () => {
      const promise = sleep(1); // <-- Will be cancelled because it is attached to this closure's scope
      CancellationScope.current().cancel();
      await promise; // <-- Promise must be awaited in order for `cancellable` to throw
    });
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof CancelledFailure) {
      console.log('Timer cancelled 👍');
    } else {
      throw e; // <-- Fail the workflow
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, the preceding can be written as the following.

```ts
import {
  CancellationScope,
  CancelledFailure,
  sleep,
} from '@temporalio/workflow';

export async function cancelTimerAltImpl(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const scope = new CancellationScope();
    const promise = scope.run(() => sleep(1));
    scope.cancel(); // <-- Cancel the timer created in scope
    await promise; // <-- Throws CancelledFailure
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof CancelledFailure) {
      console.log('Timer cancelled 👍');
    } else {
      throw e; // <-- Fail the workflow
    }
  }
}
```

### External cancellation example

The following code shows how to handle Workflow cancellation by an external client while an Activity is running.

{/* TODO: add a sample here of how this Workflow could be cancelled using a WorkflowHandle */}

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-handle-external-workflow-cancellation-while-activity-running-->

[packages/test/src/workflows/handle-external-workflow-cancellation-while-activity-running.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/packages/test/src/workflows/handle-external-workflow-cancellation-while-activity-running.ts)

```ts
import {
  CancellationScope,
  isCancellation,
  proxyActivities,
} from '@temporalio/workflow';
import type * as activities from '../activities';

const { httpPostJSON, cleanup } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '10m',
});

export async function handleExternalWorkflowCancellationWhileActivityRunning(
  url: string,
  data: any,
): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await httpPostJSON(url, data);
  } catch (err) {
    if (isCancellation(err)) {
      console.log('Workflow cancelled');
      // Cleanup logic must be in a nonCancellable scope
      // If we'd run cleanup outside of a nonCancellable scope it would've been cancelled
      // before being started because the Workflow's root scope is cancelled.
      await CancellationScope.nonCancellable(() => cleanup(url));
    }
    throw err; // <-- Fail the Workflow
  }
}
```

### nonCancellable example

`CancellationScope.nonCancellable` prevents cancellation from propagating to children.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-non-cancellable-shields-children-->

[packages/test/src/workflows/non-cancellable-shields-children.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/packages/test/src/workflows/non-cancellable-shields-children.ts)

```ts
import { CancellationScope, proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
import type * as activities from '../activities';

const { httpGetJSON } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '10m',
});

export async function nonCancellable(url: string): Promise<any> {
  // Prevent Activity from being cancelled and await completion.
  // Note that the Workflow is completely oblivious and impervious to cancellation in this example.
  return CancellationScope.nonCancellable(() => httpGetJSON(url));
}
```

### withTimeout example

A common operation is to cancel one or more Activities if a deadline elapses.
`withTimeout` creates a `CancellationScope` that is automatically cancelled after a timeout.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-multiple-activities-single-timeout-workflow-->

[packages/test/src/workflows/multiple-activities-single-timeout.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/packages/test/src/workflows/multiple-activities-single-timeout.ts)

```ts
import { CancellationScope, proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
import type * as activities from '../activities';

export function multipleActivitiesSingleTimeout(
  urls: string[],
  timeoutMs: number,
): Promise<any> {
  const { httpGetJSON } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
    startToCloseTimeout: timeoutMs,
  });

  // If timeout triggers before all activities complete
  // the Workflow will fail with a CancelledError.
  return CancellationScope.withTimeout(
    timeoutMs,
    () => Promise.all(urls.map((url) => httpGetJSON(url))),
  );
}
```

### scope.cancelRequested

You can await `cancelRequested` to make a Workflow aware of cancellation while waiting on `nonCancellable` scopes.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-cancel-requested-with-non-cancellable-->

[packages/test/src/workflows/cancel-requested-with-non-cancellable.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/packages/test/src/workflows/cancel-requested-with-non-cancellable.ts)

```ts
import {
  CancellationScope,
  CancelledFailure,
  proxyActivities,
} from '@temporalio/workflow';
import type * as activities from '../activities';

const { httpGetJSON } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '10m',
});

export async function resumeAfterCancellation(url: string): Promise<any> {
  let result: any = undefined;
  const scope = new CancellationScope({ cancellable: false });
  const promise = scope.run(() => httpGetJSON(url));
  try {
    result = await Promise.race([scope.cancelRequested, promise]);
  } catch (err) {
    if (!(err instanceof CancelledFailure)) {
      throw err;
    }
    // Prevent Workflow from completing so Activity can complete
    result = await promise;
  }
  return result;
}
```

### Cancellation scopes and callbacks

Callbacks are not particularly useful in Workflows because all meaningful asynchronous operations return promises.
In the rare case that code uses callbacks and needs to handle cancellation, a callback can consume the `CancellationScope.cancelRequested` promise.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-cancellation-scopes-with-callbacks-->

[packages/test/src/workflows/cancellation-scopes-with-callbacks.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/packages/test/src/workflows/cancellation-scopes-with-callbacks.ts)

```ts
import { CancellationScope } from '@temporalio/workflow';

function doSomething(callback: () => any) {
  setTimeout(callback, 10);
}

export async function cancellationScopesWithCallbacks(): Promise<void> {
  await new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
    doSomething(resolve);
    CancellationScope.current().cancelRequested.catch(reject);
  });
}
```

### Nesting cancellation scopes

You can achieve complex flows by nesting cancellation scopes.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-nested-cancellation-scopes-->

[packages/test/src/workflows/nested-cancellation.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/packages/test/src/workflows/nested-cancellation.ts)

```ts
import {
  CancellationScope,
  isCancellation,
  proxyActivities,
} from '@temporalio/workflow';

import type * as activities from '../activities';

const { setup, httpPostJSON, cleanup } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '10m',
});

export async function nestedCancellation(url: string): Promise<void> {
  await CancellationScope.cancellable(async () => {
    await CancellationScope.nonCancellable(() => setup());
    try {
      await CancellationScope.withTimeout(
        1000,
        () => httpPostJSON(url, { some: 'data' }),
      );
    } catch (err) {
      if (isCancellation(err)) {
        await CancellationScope.nonCancellable(() => cleanup(url));
      }
      throw err;
    }
  });
}
```

### Sharing promises between scopes

Operations like Timers and Activities are cancelled by the cancellation scope they were created in.
Promises returned by these operations can be awaited in different scopes.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-shared-promise-scopes-->

[packages/test/src/workflows/shared-promise-scopes.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/packages/test/src/workflows/shared-promise-scopes.ts)

```ts
import { CancellationScope, proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
import type * as activities from '../activities';

const { httpGetJSON } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '10m',
});

export async function sharedScopes(): Promise<any> {
  // Start activities in the root scope
  const p1 = httpGetJSON('http://url1.ninja');
  const p2 = httpGetJSON('http://url2.ninja');

  const scopePromise = CancellationScope.cancellable(async () => {
    const first = await Promise.race([p1, p2]);
    // Does not cancel activity1 or activity2 as they're linked to the root scope
    CancellationScope.current().cancel();
    return first;
  });
  return await scopePromise;
  // The Activity that did not complete will effectively be cancelled when
  // Workflow completes unless the Activity is awaited:
  // await Promise.all([p1, p2]);
}
```

```ts
import { CancellationScope, proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
import type * as activities from '../activities';

const { httpGetJSON } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '10m',
});

export async function shieldAwaitedInRootScope(): Promise<any> {
  let p: Promise<any> | undefined = undefined;

  await CancellationScope.nonCancellable(async () => {
    p = httpGetJSON('http://example.com'); // <-- Start activity in nonCancellable scope without awaiting completion
  });
  // Activity is shielded from cancellation even though it is awaited in the cancellable root scope
  return p;
}
```
