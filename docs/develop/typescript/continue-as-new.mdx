## What is Continue-As-New? {#what}

[Continue-As-New](/workflow-execution/continue-as-new) lets a Workflow Execution close successfully and creates a new Workflow Execution.
You can think of it as a checkpoint when your Workflow gets too long or approaches certain scaling limits.

The new Workflow Execution is in the same [chain](/workflow-execution#workflow-execution-chain); it keeps the same Workflow Id but gets a new Run Id and a fresh Event History.
It also receives your Workflow's usual parameters.

## How to Continue-As-New using the Typescropt SDK {#how}

First, design your Workflow parameters so that you can pass in the "current state" when you Continue-As-New into the next Workflow run.
This state is typically set to `None` for the original caller of the Workflow.

<div class="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/message-passing/safe-message-handlers/src/workflows.ts">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>
```typescript
export interface ClusterManagerInput {
  state?: ClusterManagerState;
}

export async function clusterManagerWorkflow(input: ClusterManagerInput = {}): Promise<ClusterManagerStateSummary> {
````
The test hook in the above snippet is covered [below](#how-to-test).

Inside your Workflow, call the [`ContinueAsNew()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.ContinueAsNew) function with the same type.
This stops the Workflow right away and starts a new one.

<div class="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/message-passing/safe-message-handlers/src/workflows.ts">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>
```typescript
return await wf.continueAsNew<typeof clusterManagerWorkflow>({ state: manager.getState() });
````

### Considerations for Workflows with Message Handlers {#with-message-handlers}

If you use Updates or Signals, don't call Continue-as-New from the handlers.
Instead, wait for your handlers to finish in your main Workflow before you run `ContinueAsNew`.
See the [`allHandlersFinished`](message-passing#wait-for-message-handlers) example for guidance.

## When is it right to Continue-as-New using the Typescript SDK? {#when}

Use Continue-as-New when your Workflow might hit [Event History Limits](/workflow-execution/event#event-history).

Temporal tracks your Workflow's progress against these limits to let you know when you should Continue-as-New.
Call `wf.workflowInfo().continueAsNewSuggested` to check if it's time.
