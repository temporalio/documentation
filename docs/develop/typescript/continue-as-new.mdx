description: Continue-As-New helps manage large Event Histories by initiating a new Workflow Execution with the same Workflow Id and fresh parameters, ensuring efficient Workflow management.
---

[Continue-As-New](/workflow-execution/continue-as-new) enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation if the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.
The Workflow Execution spawned from the use of Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.

To cause a Workflow Execution to [Continue-As-New](/workflow-execution/continue-as-new), the Workflow function should return the result of the [`continueAsNew`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#continueasnew).

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-continue-as-new-workflow -->

[continue-as-new/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/continue-as-new/src/workflows.ts)

```ts
import { continueAsNew, log, sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';

export async function loopingWorkflow(iteration = 0): Promise<void> {
  if (iteration === 10) {
    return;
  }
  log.info('Running Workflow iteration', { iteration });
  await sleep(1000);
  // Must match the arguments expected by `loopingWorkflow`
  await continueAsNew<typeof loopingWorkflow>(iteration + 1);
  // Unreachable code, continueAsNew is like `process.exit` and will stop execution once called.
}
```

:::warning Using Continue-as-New and Updates

- Temporal _does not_ support Continue-as-New functionality within Update handlers.
- Complete all handlers _before_ using Continue-as-New.
- Use Continue-as-New from your main Workflow Definition method, just as you would complete or fail a Workflow Execution.
