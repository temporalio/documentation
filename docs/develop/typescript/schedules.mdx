## How to Schedule a Workflow {#schedule-a-workflow}

Scheduling Workflows is a crucial aspect of any automation process, especially when dealing with time-sensitive tasks. By scheduling a Workflow, you can automate repetitive tasks, reduce the need for manual intervention, and ensure timely execution of your business processes

Use any of the following action to help Schedule a Workflow Execution and take control over your automation process.

### How to Create a Scheduled Workflow {#create}

The create action enables you to create a new Schedule. When you create a new Schedule, a unique Schedule ID is generated, which you can use to reference the Schedule in other Schedule commands.

:::tip Schedule Auto-Deletion

Once a Schedule has completed creating all its Workflow Executions, the Temporal Service deletes it since it won’t fire again.
The Temporal Service doesn't guarantee when this removal will happen.

:::

### How to Backfill a Scheduled Workflow {#backfill}

The backfill action executes Actions ahead of their specified time range. This command is useful when you need to execute a missed or delayed Action, or when you want to test the Workflow before its scheduled time.

### How to Delete a Scheduled Workflow {#delete}

The delete action enables you to delete a Schedule. When you delete a Schedule, it does not affect any Workflows that were started by the Schedule.

### How to Describe a Scheduled Workflow {#describe}

The describe action shows the current Schedule configuration, including information about past, current, and future Workflow Runs. This command is helpful when you want to get a detailed view of the Schedule and its associated Workflow Runs.

### How to List a Scheduled Workflow {#list}

The list action lists all the available Schedules. This command is useful when you want to view a list of all the Schedules and their respective Schedule IDs.

### How to Pause a Scheduled Workflow {#pause}

The pause action enables you to pause and unpause a Schedule. When you pause a Schedule, all the future Workflow Runs associated with the Schedule are temporarily stopped. This command is useful when you want to temporarily halt a Workflow due to maintenance or any other reason.

### How to Trigger a Scheduled Workflow {#trigger}

The trigger action triggers an immediate action with a given Schedule. By default, this action is subject to the Overlap Policy of the Schedule. This command is helpful when you want to execute a Workflow outside of its scheduled time.

### How to Update a Scheduled Workflow {#update}

The update action enables you to update an existing Schedule. This command is useful when you need to modify the Schedule's configuration, such as changing the start time, end time, or interval.

## How to use Temporal Cron Jobs {#temporal-cron-jobs}

:::caution Cron support is not recommended

We recommend using [Schedules](https://docs.temporal.io/schedule) instead of Cron Jobs.
Schedules were built to provide a better developer experience, including more configuration options and the ability to update or pause running Schedules.

:::

A [Temporal Cron Job](/cron-job) is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.

A Cron Schedule is provided as an option when the call to spawn a Workflow Execution is made.

You can set each Workflow to repeat on a schedule with the `cronSchedule` option:

```typescript
const handle = await client.workflow.start(scheduledWorkflow, {
  // ...
  cronSchedule: '* * * * *', // start every minute
});
```

Temporal Workflow Schedule Cron strings follow this format:

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

## Start Delay {#start-delay}

**How to use Start Delay**

Use the `startDelay` to schedule a Workflow Execution at a specific one-time future point rather than on a recurring schedule.

You may specify the `startDelay` option on either the [`client.workflow.start()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowClient#start) or [`client.workflow.execute()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowClient#execute) methods of a Workflow Client.
For example:

```typescript
const handle = await client.workflow.start(someWorkflow, {
  // ...
  startDelay: '2 hours',
});
```
