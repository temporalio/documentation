## How to develop a basic Workflow {#develop-workflows}

Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a [Workflow Definition](/workflows#workflow-definition).

In the Temporal TypeScript SDK programming model, Workflow Definitions are _just functions_, which can store state and orchestrate Activity Functions.
The following code snippet uses `proxyActivities` to schedule a `greet` Activity in the system to say hello.

A Workflow Definition can have multiple parameters; however, we recommend using a single object parameter.

```typescript
type ExampleArgs = {
  name: string;
};

export async function example(
  args: ExampleArgs
): Promise<{ greeting: string }> {
  const greeting = await greet(args.name);
  return { greeting };
}
```

### How to define Workflow parameters {#workflow-parameters}

Temporal Workflows may have any number of custom parameters.
However, we strongly recommend that objects are used as parameters, so that the object's individual fields may be altered without breaking the signature of the Workflow.
All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable.

You can define and pass parameters in your Workflow. In this example, you define your arguments in your `client.ts` file and pass those parameters to `workflow.ts` through your Workflow function.

Start a Workflow with the parameters that are in the `client.ts` file. In this example we set the `name` parameter to `Temporal` and `born` to `2019`. Then set the Task Queue and Workflow Id.

`client.ts`

```typescript
import { example } from './workflows';

...
await client.workflow.start(example, {
  args: [{ name: 'Temporal', born: 2019 }],
  taskQueue: 'your-queue',
  workflowId: 'business-meaningful-id',
});
```

In `workflows.ts` define the type of the parameter that the Workflow function takes in. The interface `ExampleParam` is a name we can now use to describe the requirement in the previous example. It still represents having the two properties called `name` and `born` that is of the type `string`. Then define a function that takes in a parameter of the type `ExampleParam` and return a `Promise<string>`. The `Promise` object represents the eventual completion, or failure, of `await client.workflow.start()` and its resulting value.

```ts
interface ExampleParam {
  name: string;
  born: number;
}
export async function example({ name, born }: ExampleParam): Promise<string> {
  return `Hello ${name}, you were born in ${born}.`;
}
```

### How to define Workflow return parameters {#workflow-return-values}

Workflow return values must also be serializable.
Returning results, returning errors, or throwing exceptions is fairly idiomatic in each language that is supported.
However, Temporal APIs that must be used to get the result of a Workflow Execution will only ever receive one of either the result or the error.

To return a value of the Workflow function, use `Promise<something>`. The `Promise` is used to make asynchronous calls and comes with guarantees.

The following example uses a `Promise<string>` to eventually return a `name` and `born` parameter.

```typescript
interface ExampleParam {
  name: string;
  born: number;
}
export async function example({ name, born }: ExampleParam): Promise<string> {
  return `Hello ${name}, you were born in ${born}.`;
}
```

### How to customize your Workflow Type {#workflow-type}

Workflows have a Type that are referred to as the Workflow name.

The following examples demonstrate how to set a custom name for your Workflow Type.

In TypeScript, the Workflow Type is the Workflow function name and there isn't a mechanism to customize the Workflow Type.

In the following example, the Workflow Type is the name of the function, `helloWorld`.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-workflow-type -->

[snippets/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/snippets/src/workflows.ts)

```ts
export async function helloWorld(): Promise<string> {
  return 'ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!';
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

### How develop Workflow logic {#workflow-logic-requirements}

Workflow logic is constrained by [deterministic execution requirements](/workflows#deterministic-constraints).
Therefore, each language is limited to the use of certain idiomatic techniques.
However, each Temporal SDK provides a set of APIs that can be used inside your Workflow to interact with external (to the Workflow) application code.

In the Temporal TypeScript SDK, Workflows run in a deterministic sandboxed environment.
The code is bundled on Worker creation using Webpack, and can import any package as long as it does not reference Node.js or DOM APIs.

:::note

If you **must** use a library that references a Node.js or DOM API and you are certain that those APIs are not used at runtime, add that module to the [ignoreModules](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.BundleOptions#ignoremodules) list.

:::

The Workflow sandbox can run only deterministic code, so side effects and access to external state must be done through Activities because Activity outputs are recorded in the Event History and can read deterministically by the Workflow.

This limitation also means that Workflow code cannot directly import the [Activity Definition](/activities#activity-definition).
[Activity Types](/activities#activity-type) can be imported, so they can be invoked in a type-safe manner.

To make the Workflow runtime deterministic, functions like `Math.random()`, `Date`, and `setTimeout()` are replaced by deterministic versions.

[FinalizationRegistry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/FinalizationRegistry) and [WeakRef](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakRef) are removed because v8's garbage collector is not deterministic.

<details>

    <summary>
      Expand to see the implications of the deterministic Date API
    </summary>

```typescript
import { sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';

// this prints the *exact* same timestamp repeatedly
for (let x = 0; x < 10; ++x) {
  console.log(Date.now());
}

// this prints timestamps increasing roughly 1s each iteration
for (let x = 0; x < 10; ++x) {
  await sleep('1 second');
  console.log(Date.now());
}
```

</details>

## How to develop a basic Activity {#develop-activities}

One of the primary things that Workflows do is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
An Activity is a normal function or method execution that's intended to execute a single, well-defined action (either short or long-running), such as querying a database, calling a third-party API, or transcoding a media file.
An Activity can interact with world outside the Temporal Platform or use a Temporal Client to interact with a Cluster.
For the Workflow to be able to execute the Activity, we must define the [Activity Definition](/activities#activity-definition).

- Activities execute in the standard Node.js environment.
- Activities cannot be in the same file as Workflows and must be separately registered.
- Activities may be retried repeatedly, so you may need to use idempotency keys for critical side effects.

Activities are _just functions_. The following is an Activity that accepts a string parameter and returns a string.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-fn -->

[snippets/src/activities.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/snippets/src/activities.ts)

```ts
export async function greet(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return `ðŸ‘‹ Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

### How to develop Activity Parameters {#activity-parameters}

There is no explicit limit to the total number of parameters that an [Activity Definition](/activities#activity-definition) may support.
However, there is a limit to the total size of the data that ends up encoded into a gRPC message Payload.

A single argument is limited to a maximum size of 2 MB.
And the total size of a gRPC message, which includes all the arguments, is limited to a maximum of 4 MB.

Also, keep in mind that all Payload data is recorded in the [Workflow Execution Event History](/workflows#event-history) and large Event Histories can affect Worker performance.
This is because the entire Event History could be transferred to a Worker Process with a [Workflow Task](/workers#workflow-task).

{/*TODO link to gRPC limit section when available */}

Some SDKs require that you pass context objects, others do not.
When it comes to your application dataâ€”that is, data that is serialized and encoded into a Payloadâ€”we recommend that you use a single object as an argument that wraps the application data passed to Activities.
This is so that you can change what data is passed to the Activity without breaking a function or method signature.

This Activity takes a single `name` parameter of type `string`.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-fn -->

[snippets/src/activities.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/snippets/src/activities.ts)

```ts
export async function greet(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return `ðŸ‘‹ Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

### How to define Activity return values {#activity-return-values}

All data returned from an Activity must be serializable.

There is no explicit limit to the amount of data that can be returned by an Activity, but keep in mind that all return values are recorded in a [Workflow Execution Event History](/workflows#event-history).

In TypeScript, the return value is always a Promise.

In the following example, `Promise<string>` is the return value.

```typescript
export async function greet(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return `ðŸ‘‹ Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### How to customize your Activity Type {#activity-type}

Activities have a Type that are referred to as the Activity name.
The following examples demonstrate how to set a custom name for your Activity Type.

You can customize the name of the Activity when you register it with the Worker.
In the following example, the Activity Name is `activityFoo`.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-custom-activity-type -->

[snippets/src/worker-activity-type-custom.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/snippets/src/worker-activity-type-custom.ts)

```ts
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import { greet } from './activities';

async function run() {
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    taskQueue: 'snippets',
    activities: {
      activityFoo: greet,
    },
  });

  await worker.run();
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

### Important design patterns for Activities {#activity-design-patterns}

The following are some important (and frequently requested) patterns for using our Activities APIs.
These patterns address common needs and use cases.

#### Share dependencies in Activity functions (dependency injection)

Because Activities are "just functions," you can also create functions that create Activities.
This is a helpful pattern for using closures to do the following:

- Store expensive dependencies for sharing, such as database connections.
- Inject secret keys (such as environment variables) from the Worker to the Activity.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-with-deps-->

[activities-dependency-injection/src/activities.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/activities-dependency-injection/src/activities.ts)

```ts
export interface DB {
  get(key: string): Promise<string>;
}

export const createActivities = (db: DB) => ({
  async greet(msg: string): Promise<string> {
    const name = await db.get('name'); // simulate read from db
    return `${msg}: ${name}`;
  },
  async greet_es(mensaje: string): Promise<string> {
    const name = await db.get('name'); // simulate read from db
    return `${mensaje}: ${name}`;
  },
});
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

<details>
  <summary>See full example</summary>

When you register these in the Worker, pass your shared dependencies accordingly:

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-deps-worker {"enable_source_link": false}-->

```ts
import { createActivities } from './activities';

async function run() {
  // Mock DB connection initialization in Worker
  const db = {
    async get(_key: string) {
      return 'Temporal';
    },
  };

  const worker = await Worker.create({
    taskQueue: 'dependency-injection',
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    activities: createActivities(db),
  });

  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

Because Activities are always referenced by name, inside the Workflow they can be proxied as normal, although the types need some adjustment:

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-deps-workflow-->

[activities-dependency-injection/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/activities-dependency-injection/src/workflows.ts)

```ts
import type { createActivities } from './activities';

// Note usage of ReturnType<> generic since createActivities is a factory function
const { greet, greet_es } = proxyActivities<
  ReturnType<typeof createActivities>
>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '30 seconds',
});
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

</details>

#### Import multiple Activities simultaneously

You can proxy multiple Activities from the same `proxyActivities` call if you want them to share the same timeouts, retries, and options:

```ts
export async function Workflow(name: string): Promise<string> {
  // destructuring multiple activities with the same options
  const { act1, act2, act3 } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>();
  /* activityOptions */
  await act1();
  await Promise.all([act2, act3]);
}
```

#### Dynamically reference Activities

Because Activities are referenced only by their string names, you can reference them dynamically if needed:

```js
export async function DynamicWorkflow(activityName, ...args) {
  const acts = proxyActivities(/* activityOptions */);

  // these are equivalent
  await acts.activity1();
  await acts['activity1']();

  // dynamic reference to activities using activityName
  let result = await acts[activityName](...args);
}
```

Type safety is still supported here, but we encourage you to validate and handle mismatches in Activity names.
An invalid Activity name leads to a `NotFoundError` with a message that looks like this:

```
ApplicationFailure: Activity function actC is not registered on this Worker, available activities: ["actA", "actB"]
```

## How to start an Activity Execution {#activity-execution}

Calls to spawn [Activity Executions](/activities#activity-execution) are written within a [Workflow Definition](/workflows#workflow-definition).
The call to spawn an Activity Execution generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands#scheduleactivitytask) Command.
This results in the set of three [Activity Task](/workers#activity-task) related Events ([ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events#activitytaskscheduled), [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events#activitytaskstarted), and ActivityTask[Closed])in your Workflow Execution Event History.

A single instance of the Activities implementation is shared across multiple simultaneous Activity invocations.
Activity implementation code should be _idempotent_.

The values passed to Activities through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the Execution history.
The entire Execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow Workers when a Workflow state needs to recover.
A large Execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.

Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data you transfer through Activity invocation parameters or Return Values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.

To spawn an Activity Execution, you must retrieve the _Activity handle_ in your Workflow.

```typescript
import { proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
// Only import the activity types
import type * as activities from './activities';

const { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',
});

// A workflow that calls an activity
export async function example(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return await greet(name);
}
```

This imports the individual Activities and declares the type alias for each Activity.

### How to set the required Activity Timeouts {#required-timeout}

Activity Execution semantics rely on several parameters.
The only required value that needs to be set is either a [Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/activities#start-to-close-timeout) or a [Start-To-Close Timeout](/activities#start-to-close-timeout).
These values are set in the Activity Options.

### How to get the results of an Activity Execution {#get-activity-results}

The call to spawn an [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution) generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands#scheduleactivitytask) Command and provides the Workflow with an Awaitable.
Workflow Executions can either block progress until the result is available through the Awaitable or continue progressing, making use of the result when it becomes available.

Since Activities are referenced by their string name, you can reference them dynamically to get the result of an Activity Execution.

```typescript
export async function DynamicWorkflow(activityName, ...args) {
  const acts = proxyActivities(/* activityOptions */);

  // these are equivalent
  await acts.activity1();
  await acts['activity1']();

  let result = await acts[activityName](...args);
  return result;
}
```

The `proxyActivities()` returns an object that calls the Activities in the function. `acts[activityName]()` references the Activity using the Activity name, then it returns the results.

## How to run Worker Processes {#run-a-dev-worker}

The [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) is where Workflow Functions and Activity Functions are executed.

- Each [Worker Entity](/workers#worker-entity) in the Worker Process must register the exact Workflow Types and Activity Types it may execute.
- Each Worker Entity must also associate itself with exactly one [Task Queue](/workers#task-queue).
- Each Worker Entity polling the same Task Queue must be registered with the same Workflow Types and Activity Types.

A [Worker Entity](/workers#worker-entity) is the component within a Worker Process that listens to a specific Task Queue.

Although multiple Worker Entities can be in a single Worker Process, a single Worker Entity Worker Process may be perfectly sufficient.
For more information, see the [Worker tuning guide](/dev-guide/worker-performance).

A Worker Entity contains a Workflow Worker and/or an Activity Worker, which makes progress on Workflow Executions and Activity Executions, respectively.

## How to run a Worker on Docker in TypeScript {#run-a-worker-on-docker}

:::note

To improve worker startup time, we recommend preparing workflow bundles ahead-of-time. See our [productionsample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/production) for details.

:::

Workers based on the TypeScript SDK can be deployed and run as Docker containers.

We recommend an LTS Node.js release such as 18 or 20.
Both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures are supported.
A glibc-based image is required; musl-based images are _not_ supported (see below).

The easiest way to deploy a TypeScript SDK Worker on Docker is to start with the `node:20-bullseye` image.
For example:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-bullseye

# For better cache utilization, copy package.json and lock file first and install the dependencies before copying the
# rest of the application and building.
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Alternatively, run npm ci, which installs only dependencies specified in the lock file and is generally faster.
RUN npm install --only=production \
    && npm run build

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

For smaller images and/or more secure deployments, it is also possible to use `-slim` Docker image variants (like `node:20-bullseye-slim`) or `distroless/nodejs` Docker images (like `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian11`) with the following caveats.

### Using `node:slim` images

`node:slim` images do not contain some of the common packages found in regular images. This results in significantly smaller images.

However, TypeScript SDK requires the presence of root TLS certificates (the `ca-certificates` package), which are not included in `slim` images.
The `ca-certificates` package is required even when connecting to a local Temporal Server or when using a server connection config that doesn't explicitly use TLS.

For this reason, the `ca-certificates` package must be installed during the construction of the Docker image.
For example:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-bullseye-slim

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y ca-certificates \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# ... same as with regular image
```

Failure to install this dependency results in a `[TransportError: transport error]` runtime error, because the certificates cannot be verified.

### Using `distroless/nodejs` images

`distroless/nodejs` images include only the files that are strictly required to execute `node`.
This results in even smaller images (approximately half the size of `node:slim` images).
It also significantly reduces the surface of potential security issues that could be exploited by a hacker in the resulting Docker images.

It is generally possible and safe to execute TypeScript SDK Workers using `distroless/nodejs` images (unless your code itself requires dependencies that are not included in `distroless/nodejs`).

However, some tools required for the build process (notably the `npm` command) are _not_ included in the `distroless/nodejs` image.
This might result in various error messages during the Docker build.

The recommanded solution is to use a multi-step Dockerfile.
For example:

```dockerfile
# -- BUILD STEP --

FROM node:20-bullseye AS builder

COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN npm install --only=production \
    && npm run build

# -- RESULTING IMAGE --

FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian11

COPY --from=builder /app /app
WORKDIR /app

CMD ["node", "build/worker.js"]
```

### Properly configure Node.js memory in Docker

By default, `node` configures its maximum old-gen memory to 25% of the _physical memory_ of the machine on which it is executing, with a maximum of 4 GB.
This is likely inappropriate when running Node.js in a Docker environment and can result in either underusage of available memory (`node` only uses a fraction of the memory allocated to the container) or overusage (`node` tries to use more memory than what is allocated to the container, which will eventually lead to the process being killed by the operating system).

Therefore we recommended that you always explicitly set the `--max-old-space-size` `node` argument to approximately 80% of the maximum size (in megabytes) that you want to allocate the `node` process.
You might need some experimentation and adjustment to find the most appropriate value based on your specific application.

In practice, it is generally easier to provide this argument through the [`NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_optionsoptions).

### Do not use Alpine

Alpine replaces glibc with musl, which is incompatible with the Rust core of the TypeScript SDK.
If you receive errors like the following, it's probably because you are using Alpine.

```sh
Error: Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: No such file or directory (needed by /opt/app/node_modules/@temporalio/core-bridge/index.node)
```

Or like this:

```sh
Error: Error relocating /opt/app/node_modules/@temporalio/core-bridge/index.node: __register_atfork: symbol not found
```

## How to run a Temporal Cloud Worker {#run-a-temporal-cloud-worker}

To run a Worker that uses [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), you need to provide additional connection and client options that include the following:

- An address that includes your [Cloud Namespace Name](/namespaces) and a port number: `<Namespace>.<ID>.tmprl.cloud:<port>`.
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates).

For more information about configuring TLS to secure inter- and intra-network communication for a Temporal Cluster, see [Temporal Customization Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server).

### How to register types {#register-types}

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it fails that Task.
However, the failure of the Task does not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

In development, use [`workflowsPath`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions/#workflowspath):

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-worker-create -->

[snippets/src/worker.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/snippets/src/worker.ts)

```ts
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as activities from './activities';

async function run() {
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    taskQueue: 'snippets',
    activities,
  });

  await worker.run();
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

In this snippet, the Worker bundles the Workflow code at runtime.

In production, you can improve your Worker's startup time by bundling in advance: as part of your production build, call `bundleWorkflowCode`:

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-bundle-workflow -->

[production/src/scripts/build-workflow-bundle.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/production/src/scripts/build-workflow-bundle.ts)

```ts
import { bundleWorkflowCode } from '@temporalio/worker';
import { writeFile } from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';

async function bundle() {
  const { code } = await bundleWorkflowCode({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('../workflows'),
  });
  const codePath = path.join(__dirname, '../../workflow-bundle.js');

  await writeFile(codePath, code);
  console.log(`Bundle written to ${codePath}`);
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

Then the bundle can be passed to the Worker:

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-production-worker-->

[production/src/worker.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/production/src/worker.ts)

```ts
const workflowOption = () =>
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? {
        workflowBundle: {
          codePath: require.resolve('../workflow-bundle.js'),
        },
      }
    : { workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows') };

async function run() {
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    ...workflowOption(),
    activities,
    taskQueue: 'production-sample',
  });

  await worker.run();
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

## How to shut down a Worker and track its state {#shut-down-a-worker}

Workers shut down if they receive any of the Signals enumerated in [shutdownSignals](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.RuntimeOptions#shutdownsignals): `'SIGINT'`, `'SIGTERM'`, `'SIGQUIT'`, and `'SIGUSR2'`.

In development, we shut down Workers with `Ctrl+C` (`SIGINT`) or [nodemon](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/c37bae3ea235d1b6956fcbe805478aa46af973ce/hello-world/package.json#L10) (`SIGUSR2`). In production, you usually want to give Workers time to finish any in-progress Activities by setting [shutdownGraceTime](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#shutdowngracetime).

As soon as a Worker receives a shutdown Signal or request, the Worker stops polling for new Tasks and allows in-flight Tasks to complete until `shutdownGraceTime` is reached.
Any Activities that are still running at that time will stop running and will be rescheduled by Temporal Server when an Activity timeout occurs.

If you must guarantee that the Worker eventually shuts down, you can set [shutdownForceTime](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#shutdownforcetime).

You might want to programmatically shut down Workers (with [Worker.shutdown()](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker#shutdown)) in integration tests or when automating a fleet of Workers.

### Worker states

At any time, you can Query Worker state with [Worker.getState()](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker#getstate).
A Worker is always in one of seven states:

- `INITIALIZED`: The initial state of the Worker after calling [Worker.create()](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker#create) and successfully connecting to the server.
- `RUNNING`: [Worker.run()](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker#run) was called and the Worker is polling Task Queues.
- `FAILED`: The Worker encountered an unrecoverable error; `Worker.run()` should reject with the error.
- The last four states are related to the Worker shutdown process:
  - `STOPPING`: The Worker received a shutdown Signal or `Worker.shutdown()` was called.
    The Worker will forcefully shut down after `shutdownGraceTime` expires.
  - `DRAINING`: All Workflow Tasks have been drained; waiting for Activities and cached Workflows eviction.
  - `DRAINED`: All Activities and Workflows have completed; ready to shut down.
  - `STOPPED`: Shutdown complete; `worker.run()` resolves.

If you need more visibility into internal Worker state, see the [Worker class](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker) in the API reference.

## How to start a Workflow Execution {#start-workflow-execution}

[Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) semantics rely on several parametersâ€”that is, to start a Workflow Execution you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type, language-specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

In the examples below, all Workflow Executions are started using a Temporal Client.
To spawn Workflow Executions from within another Workflow Execution, use either the [Child Workflow](/develop/typescript/child-workflows) or External Workflow APIs.

See the [Customize Workflow Type](#workflow-type) section to see how to customize the name of the Workflow Type.

A request to spawn a Workflow Execution causes the Temporal Cluster to create the first Event ([WorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#workflowexecutionstarted)) in the Workflow Execution Event History.
The Temporal Cluster then creates the first Workflow Task, resulting in the first [WorkflowTaskScheduled](/references/events#workflowtaskscheduled) Event.

When you have a Client, you can schedule the start of a Workflow with `client.workflow.start()`, specifying `workflowId`, `taskQueue`, and `args` and returning a Workflow handle immediately after the Server acknowledges the receipt.

```typescript
const handle = await client.workflow.start(example, {
  workflowId: 'your-workflow-id',
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
  args: ['argument01', 'argument02', 'argument03'], // this is typechecked against workflowFn's args
});
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
const result = await handle.result();
```

Calling `client.workflow.start()` and `client.workflow.execute()` send a command to Temporal Server to schedule a new Workflow Execution on the specified Task Queue. It does not actually start until a Worker that has a matching Workflow Type, polling that Task Queue, picks it up.

You can test this by executing a Client command without a matching Worker. Temporal Server records the command in Event History, but does not make progress with the Workflow Execution until a Worker starts polling with a matching Task Queue and Workflow Definition.

Workflow Execution run in a separate V8 isolate context in order to provide a [deterministic runtime](/workflows#deterministic-constraints).

### How to set a Workflow's Task Queue {#set-task-queue}

In most SDKs, the only Workflow Option that must be set is the name of the [Task Queue](/workers#task-queue).

For any code to execute, a Worker Process must be running that contains a Worker Entity that is polling the same Task Queue name.

A Task Queue is a dynamic queue in Temporal polled by one or more Workers.

Workers bundle Workflow code and node modules using Webpack v5 and execute them inside V8 isolates.
Activities are directly required and run by Workers in the Node.js environment.

Workers are flexible.
You can host any or all of your Workflows and Activities on a Worker, and you can host multiple Workers on a single machine.

The Worker need three main things:

- `taskQueue`: The Task Queue to poll. This is the only required argument.
- `activities`: Optional. Imported and supplied directly to the Worker.
- Workflow bundle. Choose one of the following options:
  - Specify `workflowsPath` pointing to your `workflows.ts` file to pass to Webpack; for example, `require.resolve('./workflows')`.
    Workflows are bundled with their dependencies.
  - If you prefer to handle the bundling yourself, pass a prebuilt bundle to `workflowBundle`.

```ts
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as activities from './activities';

async function run() {
  // Step 1: Register Workflows and Activities with the Worker and connect to
  // the Temporal server.
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    activities,
    taskQueue: 'hello-world',
  });
  // Worker connects to localhost by default and uses console.error for logging.
  // Customize the Worker by passing more options to create():
  // https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker
  // If you need to configure server connection parameters, see docs:
  // /typescript/security#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls

  // Step 2: Start accepting tasks on the `tutorial` queue
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

`taskQueue` is the only required option; however, use `workflowsPath` and `activities` to register Workflows and Activities with the Worker.

When scheduling a Workflow, you must specify `taskQueue`.

```ts
import { Client, Connection } from '@temporalio/client';
// This is the code that is used to start a Workflow.
const connection = await Connection.create();
const client = new Client({ connection });
const result = await client.workflow.execute(yourWorkflow, {
  // required
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
  // required
  workflowId: 'your-workflow-id',
});
```

When creating a Worker, you must pass the `taskQueue` option to the `Worker.create()` function.

```ts
const worker = await Worker.create({
  // imported elsewhere
  activities,
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
});
```

Optionally, in Workflow code, when calling an Activity, you can specify the Task Queue by passing the `taskQueue` option to `proxyActivities()`, `startChild()`, or `executeChild()`.
If you do not specify `taskQueue`, the TypeScript SDK places Activity and Child Workflow Tasks in the same Task Queue as the Workflow Task Queue.

### How to set a Workflow Id {#workflow-id}

Although it is not required, we recommend providing your own [Workflow Id](/workflows#workflow-id) that maps to a business process or business entity identifier, such as an order identifier or customer identifier.

Connect to a Client with `client.workflow.start()` and any arguments. Then specify your `taskQueue` and set your `workflowId` to a meaningful business identifier.

```typescript
const handle = await client.workflow.start(example, {
  workflowId: 'yourWorkflowId',
  taskQueue: 'yourTaskQueue',
  args: ['your', 'arg', 'uments'],
});
```

This starts a new Client with the given Workflow Id, Task Queue name, and an argument.

### How to get the results of a Workflow Execution {#get-workflow-results}

If the call to start a Workflow Execution is successful, you will gain access to the Workflow Execution's Run Id.

The Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace may be used to uniquely identify a Workflow Execution in the system and get its result.

It's possible to both block progress on the result (synchronous execution) or get the result at some other point in time (asynchronous execution).

In the Temporal Platform, it's also acceptable to use Queries as the preferred method for accessing the state and results of Workflow Executions.

To return the results of a Workflow Execution:

```typescript
return (
  'Completed ' +
  wf.workflowInfo().workflowId +
  ', Total Charged: ' +
  totalCharged
);
```

`totalCharged` is just a function declared in your code. For a full example, see [subscription-workflow-project-template-typescript/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/subscription-workflow-project-template-typescript/blob/main/src/workflows.ts).

A Workflow function may return a result. If it doesn't (in which case the return type is `Promise<void>`), the result will be `undefined`.

If you started a Workflow with `client.workflow.start()`, you can choose to wait for the result anytime with `handle.result()`.

```typescript
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
const result = await handle.result();
```

Using a Workflow Handle isn't necessary with `client.workflow.execute()`.

Workflows that prematurely end will throw a `WorkflowFailedError` if you call `result()`.

If you call `result()` on a Workflow that prematurely ended for some reason, it throws a [`WorkflowFailedError` error](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowFailedError/) that reflects the reason. For that reason, it is recommended to catch that error.

```typescript
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
try {
  const result = await handle.result();
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof WorkflowFailedError) {
    throw new Error('Temporal workflow failed: ' + workflowId, {
      cause: err,
    });
  } else {
    throw new Error('error from Temporal workflow ' + workflowId, {
      cause: err,
    });
  }
}
```
