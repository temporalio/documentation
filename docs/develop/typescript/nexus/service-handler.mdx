:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal TypeScript SDK support for Nexus is at
[Pre-release](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#pre-release).

All APIs are experimental and may be subject to backwards-incompatible changes.

:::

Use [Temporal Nexus](/evaluate/nexus) to connect Temporal Applications within and across Namespaces using a Nexus
Endpoint, a Nexus Service contract, and Nexus Operations.

This page shows how to do the following:

- [Run a development Temporal Service with Nexus enabled](/develop/typescript/nexus#run-the-temporal-nexus-development-server)
- [Define the Nexus Service contract](#define-nexus-service-contract)
- [Develop a Nexus Service and Operation handlers](#develop-nexus-service-operation-handlers)
- [Develop a caller Workflow that uses a Nexus Service](#develop-caller-workflow-nexus-service)
- [Understand exceptions in Nexus Operations](#exceptions-in-nexus-operations)
- [Cancel a Nexus Operation](#canceling-a-nexus-operation)
- [Make Nexus calls across Namespaces in Temporal Cloud](#nexus-calls-across-namespaces-temporal-cloud)

## Define the Nexus Service contract {#define-nexus-service-contract}

Defining a clear contract for the Nexus Service is crucial for smooth communication.

In this example, there is a service package that describes the Service and Operation names along with input/output types
for caller Workflows to use the Nexus Endpoint.

Each [Temporal SDK includes and uses a default Data Converter](https://docs.temporal.io/dataconversion). The default
data converter encodes payloads in the following order: Null, Byte array, and JSON. In a polyglot environment, that is
where more than one language and SDK is being used to develop a Temporal solution, JSON is a common choice. This example
uses plain TypeScript objects, serialized into JSON.

Note: By default, the TypeScript SDK
[does not support Protobuf JSON encoding](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.PayloadConverter). If
passing Protobuf payloads use the
[ProtobufJsonPayloadConverter](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/protobufs.ProtobufJsonPayloadConverter)
instead.

## Develop a Nexus Service handler and Operation handlers {#develop-nexus-service-operation-handlers}

A Nexus Service handler is defined using the `nexus-rpc`'s
[`serviceHandler`](https://nexus-rpc.github.io/sdk-typescript/functions/serviceHandler.html) function. {/* Added */}
Nexus Service handlers are typically defined in the same Worker as the underlying Temporal primitives they abstract. A
Service handler must provide Operation handlers for each Operation declared by the Service. {/* Added */} Operation
handlers can decide if a given Nexus Operation will be synchronous or asynchronous. They can execute arbitrary code, and
invoke underlying Temporal primitives such as a Workflow, Query, Signal, or Update.

The `@temporalio/nexus` package provides utilities to help create Nexus Operations that interracts with a Temporal
namespace: {/* Extended */}

- `WorkflowRunOperationHandler` - Create an asynchronous operation handler that starts a Workflow.
- `getClient()` - Get a Temporal Client connected using the same `NativeConnection` as the present Temporal Worker. It
  can be used to implement synchronous handlers backed by Temporal primitives such as Signals and Queries.

### Develop a Synchronous Nexus Operation handler

Simple RPC handlers can be implemented as synchronous Nexus Operation handlers, which is defined in TypeScript as a
simple async function. {/* sync operation vs async func is very confusing in this context */} The handler function can
obtain a Temporal Client, using `getClient()`, which can be used for signaling, querying, and listing Workflows.
However, implementations are free to make arbitrary calls to other services or databases, or perform computations such
as this one:

[nexus-hello/src/service/handler.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/nexus-hello/src/service/handler.ts)

```ts
// ...
import * as nexus from 'nexus-rpc';
// ...
import { helloService, EchoInput, EchoOutput, HelloInput, HelloOutput } from '../api';
// ...

export const helloServiceHandler = nexus.serviceHandler(helloService, {
  echo: async (ctx, input: EchoInput): Promise<EchoOutput> => {
    // A simple async function can be used to defined a Synchronous Nexus Operation.
    // This is often sufficient for Operations that simply make arbitrary short calls to
    // other services or databases, or that perform simple computations such as this one.
    //
    // You may also access a Temporal Client by calling `temporalNexus.getClient()`.
    // That Client can be used to make arbitrary calls, such as signaling, querying,
    // or listing workflows.
    return input;
  },
  // ...
});
```

### Develop an Asynchronous Nexus Operation handler to start a Workflow

Use `@temporalio/nexus`'s `WorkflowRunOperationHandler` helper class to easily expose a Temporal Workflow as a Nexus
Operation. Note that even though a Nexus operation can only take one input parameter, if you need to pass multiple
arguments through to the workflow, you can do so by using multiple properties of the input object, and placing them in
the array provided to the `args` option when calling `startWorkflow`.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-nexus-hello-service-handler {"selectedLines": ["1-7","18-37"]}-->

[nexus-hello/src/service/handler.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/nexus-hello/src/service/handler.ts)

```ts
import { randomUUID } from 'crypto';
import * as nexus from 'nexus-rpc';
import * as temporalNexus from '@temporalio/nexus';
import { helloService, EchoInput, EchoOutput, HelloInput, HelloOutput } from '../api';
import { helloWorkflow } from './workflows';

export const helloServiceHandler = nexus.serviceHandler(helloService, {
  // ...
  hello: new temporalNexus.WorkflowRunOperationHandler<HelloInput, HelloOutput>(
    // WorkflowRunOperationHandler takes a function that receives the Operation's context and input.
    // That function can be used to validate and/or transform the input before passing it to
    // the Workflow, as well as to customize various Workflow start options as appropriate.
    // Call temporalNexus.startWorkflow() to actually start the Workflow from inside the
    // WorkflowRunOperationHandler's delegate function.
    async (ctx, input: HelloInput) => {
      return await temporalNexus.startWorkflow(ctx, helloWorkflow, {
        args: [input],

        // Workflow IDs should typically be business-meaningful IDs and are used to dedupe workflow starts.
        // For this example, we're using the request ID allocated by Temporal when the caller workflow schedules
        // the operation, this ID is guaranteed to be stable across retries of this operation.
        workflowId: ctx.requestId ?? randomUUID(),

        // Task queue defaults to the task queue this Operation is handled on.
      });
    }
  ),
});
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

Workflow IDs should typically be business-meaningful IDs and are used to dedupe Workflow starts. In general, the ID
should be passed in the Operation input as part of the Nexus Service contract.

### Register your Nexus Service handler in a Worker

After developing an asynchronous Nexus Operation handler to start a Workflow, the next step is to register your Nexus
Service handler in a Worker.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-nexus-hello-service-worker {"selectedLines": ["1-3","9-17"]}-->

[nexus-hello/src/service/worker.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/nexus-hello/src/service/worker.ts)

```ts
import { Worker, NativeConnection } from '@temporalio/worker';
import { helloServiceHandler } from './handler';

// ...
const namespace = 'my-target-namespace';
const serviceTaskQueue = 'my-handler-task-queue';
const worker = await Worker.create({
  connection,
  namespace,
  taskQueue: serviceTaskQueue,
  workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
  nexusServices: [helloServiceHandler],
});
```

## Develop a caller Workflow that uses the Nexus Service {#develop-caller-workflow-nexus-service}

To execute a Nexus Operation from a Workflow, import the necessary service definition types, then use
`@temporalio/workflow`'s `createNexusClient` to create a Nexus client for that service. You will need to provide the
Nexus Endpoint name, which you registered previously in
[Create a Nexus Endpoint to route requests from caller to handler](#create-nexus-endpoint).

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-nexus-hello-service-caller-workflow {"selectedLines": ["1-5","21-34"]}-->

[nexus-hello/src/caller/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/nexus-hello/src/caller/workflows.ts)

```ts
import * as wf from '@temporalio/workflow';
import { helloService, LanguageCode } from '../service/api';

const HELLO_SERVICE_ENDPOINT = 'hello-service-endpoint-name';

export async function helloCallerWorkflow(name: string, language: LanguageCode): Promise<string> {
  const nexusClient = wf.createNexusClient({
    service: helloService,
    endpoint: HELLO_SERVICE_ENDPOINT,
  });

  const helloResult = await nexusClient.executeOperation(
    'hello',
    { name, language },
    { scheduleToCloseTimeout: '10s' }
  );

  return helloResult.message;
}
```

### Register the caller Workflow in a Worker and start the caller Workflow

This Workflow can be registered with a Worker and started using `client.startWorkflow()` or `client.executeWorkflow()`,
as usual. Refer to the
[complete TypeScript sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/nexus-hello) for reference.

- [nexus-hello/src/caller/worker.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/nexus-hello/src/caller/worker.ts)
  shows how to register the caller Workflow in a Worker and run the Worker.
- [nexus-hello/src/starter.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/nexus-hello/src/starter.ts)
  shows how to use a Temporal Client to execute the sample caller Workflow.

## Exceptions in Nexus operations {#exceptions-in-nexus-operations}

Temporal provides general guidance on
[Errors in Nexus operations](https://docs.temporal.io/references/failures#errors-in-nexus-operations). In TypeScript,
there are three Nexus-specific exception classes:

- `nexus-rpc`'s [`OperationError`](https://nexus-rpc.github.io/sdk-typescript/classes/OperationError.html): this is the
  exception type you should throw in a Nexus operation to indicate that it has failed according to its own application
  logic and should not be retried.
- `nexus-rpc`'s [`HandlerError`](https://nexus-rpc.github.io/sdk-typescript/classes/HandlerError.html): you can throw
  this exception type in a Nexus operation with a specific
  [HandlerErrorType](https://nexus-rpc.github.io/sdk-typescript/types/HandlerErrorType.html). The error will be marked
  as either retryable or non-retryable according to the type, following the
  [Nexus spec](https://github.com/nexus-rpc/api/blob/main/SPEC.md#predefined-handler-errors). The non-retryable handler
  error types are `BAD_REQUEST`, `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `NOT_FOUND`, `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`; the retryable types
  are `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, `INTERNAL`, `UNAVAILABLE`, `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`.
- `@temporalio/nexus`'s
  [`NexusOperationFailure`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.NexusOperationFailure): this is the error
  thrown inside a Workflow when a Nexus operation fails for any reason. Use the `cause` attribute on the exception to
  access the cause chain.

## Canceling a Nexus Operation {#canceling-a-nexus-operation}

Nexus Operations, just like other cancellable APIs provided by the `@temporalio/workflow` package, execute within
Cancellation Scopes. Requesting cancellation of a Cancellation Scope results in requesting cancellation for all
cancellable operations owned by that scope. The Workflow itself defines the root Cancellation Scope. Requesting
cancellation of the Workflow therefore propagates the cancellation request to all cancellable operations started by that
workflow, including Nexus Operations.

To provide more granular control over cancellation of a specific Nexus Operation, you may explicitly create a new
Cancellation Scope, and start the Nexus Operation from within that scope. An example demonstrating this can be found at
our [nexus cancellation sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/nexus-cancellation).

Only asynchronous operations can be canceled in Nexus, since cancellation is sent using an operation token. The Workflow
or other resources backing the operation may choose to ignore the cancellation request.

Once the caller Workflow completes, the caller's Nexus Machinery will not make any further attempts to cancel operations
that are still running. It's okay to leave operations running in some use cases. To ensure cancellations are delivered,
wait for all pending operations to finish before exiting the Workflow.
