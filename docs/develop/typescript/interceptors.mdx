description: Learn how to implement Interceptors in TypeScript using the Temporal TypeScript SDK to manage inbound and outbound SDK calls, enhance tracing, and add authorization to your Workflows and Activities.
---


Interceptors are a mechanism for modifying inbound and outbound SDK calls.
Interceptors are commonly used to add tracing and authorization to the scheduling and execution of Workflows and Activities.
You can compare these to "middleware" in other frameworks.

## How to implement interceptors in TypeScript {#interceptors}

The TypeScript SDK comes with an optional interceptor package that adds tracing with [OpenTelemetry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@temporalio/interceptors-opentelemetry).
See how to use it in the [interceptors-opentelemetry](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/interceptors-opentelemetry) code sample.

- [WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor/): Intercept Workflow inbound calls like execution, Signals, and Queries.
- [WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor/): Intercept Workflow outbound calls to Temporal APIs like scheduling Activities and starting Timers.
- [ActivityInboundCallsInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.ActivityInboundCallsInterceptor): Intercept inbound calls to an Activity (such as `execute`).
- [WorkflowClientInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowClientInterceptor/): Intercept workflow-related methods of [`Client`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.Client/) and [`WorkflowHandle`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowHandle) like starting or signaling a Workflow.

Interceptors are run in a chain, and all interceptors work similarly.
They accept two arguments: `input` and `next`, where `next` calls the next interceptor in the chain.
All interceptor methods are optionalâ€”it's up to the implementor to choose which methods to intercept.

## Interceptor examples

**Log start and completion of Activities**

```ts
import {
  ActivityInput,
  Next,
  WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor,
} from '@temporalio/workflow';

export class ActivityLogInterceptor
  implements WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor
{
  constructor(public readonly workflowType: string) {}

  async scheduleActivity(
    input: ActivityInput,
    next: Next<WorkflowOutboundCallsInterceptor, 'scheduleActivity'>,
  ): Promise<unknown> {
    console.log('Starting activity', { activityType: input.activityType });
    try {
      return await next(input);
    } finally {
      console.log('Completed activity', {
        workflow: this.workflowType,
        activityType: input.activityType,
      });
    }
  }
}
```

**Authorization**

```ts
import {
  defaultDataConverter,
  Next,
  WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor,
  WorkflowInput,
} from '@temporalio/workflow';

/**
 * WARNING: This demo is meant as a simple auth example.
 * Do not use this for actual authorization logic.
 * Auth headers should be encrypted and credentials
 * stored outside of the codebase.
 */
export class DumbWorkflowAuthInterceptor
  implements WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor
{
  public async execute(
    input: WorkflowInput,
    next: Next<WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor, 'execute'>,
  ): Promise<unknown> {
    const authHeader = input.headers.auth;
    const { user, password } = authHeader
      ? await defaultDataConverter.fromPayload(authHeader)
      : undefined;

    if (!(user === 'admin' && password === 'admin')) {
      throw new Error('Unauthorized');
    }
    return await next(input);
  }
}
```

To properly do authorization from Workflow code, the Workflow would need to access encryption keys and possibly authenticate against an external user database, which requires the Workflow to break isolation.

## Register an Interceptor {#register-interceptor}

### Activity and client interceptors registration

- Activity interceptors are registered on Worker creation by passing an array of [ActivityInboundCallsInterceptor factory functions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.ActivityInboundCallsInterceptorFactory) through [WorkerOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#interceptors).

- Client interceptors are registered on `Client` construction by passing an array of [WorkflowClientInterceptor](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowClientInterceptor) via [ClientOptions.interceptors](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.ClientOptions#interceptors).

### Workflow interceptors registration

Workflow interceptor registration is different from the other interceptors because they run in the Workflow isolate.
To register Workflow interceptors, export an `interceptors` function from a file located in the `workflows` directory and provide the name of that file to the Worker on creation via [WorkerOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#interceptors).

At the time of construction, the Workflow context is already initialized for the current Workflow.
You may call the [`workflowInfo()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#workflowinfo) function to access Workflow-specific information from an interceptor.

`src/workflows/your-interceptors.ts`

```ts
import { workflowInfo } from '@temporalio/workflow';

export const interceptors = () => ({
  outbound: [new ActivityLogInterceptor(workflowInfo().workflowType)],
  inbound: [],
});
```

`src/worker/index.ts`

```ts
const worker = await Worker.create({
  workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
  interceptors: {
    workflowModules: [require.resolve('./workflows/your-interceptors')],
  },
});
```
