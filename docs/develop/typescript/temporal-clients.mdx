A [Temporal Client](https://chatgpt.com/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the
Temporal Service. Communication with a Temporal Service lets you perform actions such as starting Workflow Executions,
sending Signals and Queries to Workflow Executions, getting Workflow results, and more. You cannot initialize a Temporal
Client inside a Workflow. However, they're commonly initialized inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal
Service.

This page shows you how to do the following using the TypeScript SDK with the Temporal Client:

- [Connect to a local development Temporal Service](#connect-to-development-service)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Connect to Temporal Service from a Worker](#connect-to-temporal-service-from-a-worker)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](#start-workflow)
- [Get Workflow results](#get-workflow-results)

In the TypeScript SDK, connecting to Temporal Service from a Temporal Application and from within an Activity rely on a
different type of connection than connecting from a Worker. The sections
[Connect to a local development Temporal Service](#connect-to-development-service) and
[Connect to Temporal Cloud](#connect-to-temporal-cloud) apply to connecting from a Temporal Application or from within
an Activity. See [Connect to Temporal Service from a Worker](#connect-to-temporal-service-from-a-worker) for details on
connecting from a Worker.

## Connect to development Temporal Service {#connect-to-development-service}

To connect to a development Temporal service from a Temporal Application or from within an Activity, use
[`Connect.connect`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.Connection#connect) to create a Connection object
to connect to the Temporal Service, and pass in that connection when you create a new `Client` instance. You can provide
connections directly in code, load them from **environment variables**, or a **TOML configuration file** using the
`@temporalio/envconfig` helpers. We recommend environment variables or a configuration file for secure, repeatable
configuration.

When you’re running a Temporal Service locally, such as with the
[Temporal CLI dev server](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/server#start-dev), the required options are minimal. If you don't
specify a host/port, the SDK defaults to `127.0.0.1:7233` and the `default` Namespace.

<Tabs groupId="connect-options-dotnet" defaultValue="config-file" >

<TabItem value="config-file" label="Configuration File">

You can use a TOML configuration file to set connection options for the Temporal Client. The configuration file lets you
configure multiple profiles, each with its own set of connection options. You can then specify which profile to use when
creating the Temporal Client. You can use the environment variable `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` to specify the location of the
TOML file or provide the path to the file directly in code. If you don't provide the configuration file path, the SDK
looks for it at the path `~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml` or the equivalent on your OS. Refer to
[Environment Configuration](../environment-configuration.mdx#configuration-methods) for more details about configuration
files and profiles.

:::info

The connection options set in configuration files have lower precedence than environment variables. This means that if
you set the same option in both the configuration file and as an environment variable, the environment variable value
overrides the option set in the configuration file.

:::

For example, the following TOML configuration file defines two profiles: `default` and `prod`. Each profile has its own
set of connection options.

```toml title="config.toml"
# Default profile for local development
[profile.default]
address = "localhost:7233"
namespace = "default"

# Optional: Add custom gRPC headers
[profile.default.grpc_meta]
my-custom-header = "development-value"
trace-id = "dev-trace-123"

# Production profile for Temporal Cloud
[profile.prod]
address = "your-namespace.a1b2c.tmprl.cloud:7233"
namespace = "your-namespace"
api_key = "your-api-key-here"

# TLS configuration for production
[profile.prod.tls]
# TLS auto-enables when TLS config or an API key is present
# disabled = false
client_cert_path = "/etc/temporal/certs/client.pem"
client_key_path  = "/etc/temporal/certs/client.key"

# Custom headers for production
[profile.prod.grpc_meta]
environment     = "production"
service-version = "v1.2.3"
```

You can create a Temporal Client using a profile from the configuration file as follows. In this example, you load the
`default` profile for local development:

{/* SNIPSTART typescript-env-config-load-default-profile {"highlightedLines": "{17-19}"} */}
[env-config/src/load-from-file.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/env-config/src/load-from-file.ts)

```ts
import { Connection, Client } from '@temporalio/client';
import { loadClientConnectConfig } from '@temporalio/envconfig';
import { resolve } from 'path';

async function main() {
  console.log('--- Loading default profile from config.toml ---');

  // For this sample to be self-contained, we explicitly provide the path to
  // the config.toml file included in this directory.
  // By default though, the config.toml file will be loaded from
  // ~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml (or the equivalent standard config directory on your OS).
  const configFile = resolve(__dirname, '../config.toml');

  // loadClientConnectConfig is a helper that loads a profile and prepares
  // the configuration for Connection.connect and Client. By default, it loads the
  // "default" profile.
  const config = loadClientConnectConfig({
    configSource: { path: configFile },
  });

  console.log(`Loaded 'default' profile from ${configFile}.`);
  console.log(`  Address: ${config.connectionOptions.address}`);
  console.log(`  Namespace: ${config.namespace}`);
  console.log(`  gRPC Metadata: ${JSON.stringify(config.connectionOptions.metadata)}`);

  console.log('\nAttempting to connect to client...');
  try {
    const connection = await Connection.connect(config.connectionOptions);
    const client = new Client({ connection, namespace: config.namespace });
    console.log('✅ Client connected successfully!');
    await connection.close();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(`❌ Failed to connect: ${err}`);
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

<TabItem value="env-vars" label="Environment Variables">

Use the `EnvConfig` package to set connection options for the Temporal Client using environment variables. For a list of
all available environment variables and their default values, refer to
[Environment Configuration](/references/client-environment-configuration).

For example, the following code snippet loads all environment variables and creates a Temporal Client with the options
specified in those variables. If you have defined a configuration file at either the default location
(`~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml`) or a custom location specified by the `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` environment
variable, this will also load the default profile in the configuration file. However, any options set via environment
variables will take precedence.

Set the following environment variables before running your .NET application. Replace the placeholder values with your
actual configuration. Since this is for a local development Temporal Service, the values connect to `localhost:7233` and
the `default` Namespace. You may omit these variables entirely since they're the defaults.

```bash
export TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE="default"
export TEMPORAL_ADDRESS="localhost:7233"
```

After setting the environment variables, use the following code to create the Temporal Client:

```csharp
using Temporalio.Client;
using Temporalio.Client.EnvConfig;

namespace TemporalioSamples.EnvConfig;

/// <summary>
/// Sample demonstrating loading the default environment configuration profile
/// from a TOML file.
/// </summary>
public static class LoadFromFile
{
    public static async Task RunAsync()
    {
        try
        {
            var connectOptions = ClientEnvConfig.LoadClientConnectOptions();

            Console.WriteLine("\nAttempting to connect to client...");

            var client = await TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(connectOptions);
            Console.WriteLine("✅ Client connected successfully!");
        }
        catch (Exception ex) when (ex is not OperationCanceledException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"❌ Failed to connect: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="code" label="Code">

If you don't want to use environment variables or a configuration file, you can specify connection options directly in
code. This is convenient for local development and testing. You can also load a base configuration from environment
variables or a configuration file, and then override specific options in code.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Temporalio.Client;

namespace TemporalioSamples.Manual
{
    public static class ManualConnect
    {
        public static async Task RunAsync()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("--- Connecting manually to Temporal ---");

            var client = await TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(new TemporalClientConnectOptions
            {
                TargetHost = "localhost:7233",
                Namespace  = "default",
            });

            Console.WriteLine("✅ Connected to local Temporal service!");
        }
    }
}

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Connect to Temporal Cloud {#connect-to-temporal-cloud}

You can connect to Temporal Cloud using either an [API key](/cloud/api-keys) or through mTLS. Connection to Temporal
Cloud or any secured Temporal Service requires additional connection options compared to connecting to an unsecured
local development instance:

- Your credentials for authentication.
  - If you are using an API key, provide the API key value.
  - If you are using mTLS, provide the mTLS CA certificate and mTLS private key.
- Your _Namespace and Account ID_ combination, which follows the format `<namespace_id>.<account_id>`.
- The _endpoint_ may vary. The most common endpoint used is the gRPC regional endpoint, which follows the format:
  `<region>.<cloud_provider>.api.temporal.io:7233`.
- For Namespaces with High Availability features with API key authentication enabled, use the gRPC Namespace endpoint:
  `<namespace>.<account>.tmprl.cloud:7233`. This allows automated failover without needing to switch endpoints.

You can find the Namespace and Account ID, as well as the endpoint, on the Namespaces tab:

![The Namespace and Account ID combination on the left, and the regional endpoint on the right](/img/cloud/apikeys/namespaces-and-regional-endpoints.png)

You can provide these connection options using environment variables, a configuration file, or directly in code.

<Tabs groupId="connect-api-key-options-dotnet" defaultValue="config-file" >

<TabItem value="config-file" label="Configuration File">

You can use a TOML configuration file to set connection options for the Temporal Client. The configuration file lets you
configure multiple profiles, each with its own set of connection options. You can then specify which profile to use when
creating the Temporal Client. For a list of all available configuration options you can set in the TOML file, refer to
[Environment Configuration](/references/client-environment-configuration).

You can use the environment variable `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` to specify the location of the TOML file or provide the path
to the file directly in code. If you don't provide the path to the configuration file, the SDK looks for it at the
default path `~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml`.

:::info

The connection options set in configuration files have lower precedence than environment variables. This means that if
you set the same option in both the configuration file and as an environment variable, the environment variable value
overrides the option set in the configuration file.

:::

For example, the following TOML configuration file defines a `cloud` profile with the necessary connection options to
connect to Temporal Cloud via an API key:

```toml
# Cloud profile for Temporal Cloud
[profile.cloud]
address = "your-namespace.a1b2c.tmprl.cloud:7233"
namespace = "your-namespace"
api_key = "your-api-key-here"
```

If you want to use mTLS authentication instead of an API key, replace the `api_key` field with your mTLS certificate and
private key:

```toml
# Cloud profile for Temporal Cloud
[profile.cloud]
address = "your-namespace.a1b2c.tmprl.cloud:7233"
namespace = "your-namespace"
tls_client_cert_data = "your-tls-client-cert-data"
tls_client_key_path = "your-tls-client-key-path"
```

With the connections options defined in the configuration file, use the `ClientEnvConfig.LoadClientConnectOptions`
method to create a Temporal Client using the `staging` profile as follows. After loading the profile, you can also
programmatically override specific connection options before creating the client.

```csharp title="LoadProfile.cs" {25. 41}
using Temporalio.Client;
using Temporalio.Client.EnvConfig;

namespace TemporalioSamples.EnvConfig;

/// <summary>
/// Sample demonstrating loading a named environment configuration profile and
/// programmatically overriding its values.
/// </summary>
public static class LoadProfile
{
    public static async Task RunAsync()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Loading 'staging' profile with programmatic overrides ---");

        try
        {
            var configFile = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "config.toml");
            var profileName = "staging";

            Console.WriteLine("The 'staging' profile in config.toml has an incorrect address (localhost:9999).");
            Console.WriteLine("We'll programmatically override it to the correct address.");

            // Load the 'staging' profile
            var connectOptions = ClientEnvConfig.LoadClientConnectOptions(new ClientEnvConfig.ProfileLoadOptions
            {
                Profile = profileName,
                ConfigSource = DataSource.FromPath(configFile),
            });

            // Override the target host to the correct address.
            // This is the recommended way to override configuration values.
            connectOptions.TargetHost = "localhost:7233";

            Console.WriteLine($"\nLoaded '{profileName}' profile from {configFile} with overrides.");
            Console.WriteLine($"  Address: {connectOptions.TargetHost} (overridden from localhost:9999)");
            Console.WriteLine($"  Namespace: {connectOptions.Namespace}");

            Console.WriteLine("\nAttempting to connect to client...");

            var client = await TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(connectOptions);
            Console.WriteLine("✅ Client connected successfully!");

            // Test the connection by checking the service
            var sysInfo = await client.Connection.WorkflowService.GetSystemInfoAsync(new());
            Console.WriteLine("✅ Successfully verified connection to Temporal server!\n{0}", sysInfo);
        }
        catch (Exception ex) when (ex is not OperationCanceledException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"❌ Failed to connect: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="env-vars" label="Environment Variables">

The following environment variables are required to connect to Temporal Cloud:

- `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE`: Your Namespace and Account ID combination in the format `<namespace_id>.<account_id>`.
- `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`: The gRPC endpoint for your Temporal Cloud Namespace.
- `TEMPORAL_API_KEY`: Your API key value. Required if you are using API key authentication.
- `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_DATA` or `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`: Your mTLS client certificate data or file path.
  Required if you are using mTLS authentication.
- `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_DATA` or `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`: Your mTLS client private key data or file path.
  Required if you are using mTLS authentication.

Ensure these environment variables exist in your environment before running your .NET application.

Import the `EnvConfig` package to set connection options for the Temporal Client using environment variables. The
`MustLoadDefaultClientOptions` function will automatically load all environment variables. For a list of all available
environment variables and their default values, refer to
[Environment Configuration](/references/client-environment-configuration).

For example, the following code snippet loads all environment variables and creates a Temporal Client with the options
specified in those variables. If you have defined a configuration file at either the default location
(`~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml`) or a custom location specified by the `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` environment
variable, this will also load the default profile in the configuration file. However, any options set via environment
variables will take precedence.

## Start Workflow Execution {#start-workflow-execution}

**How to start a Workflow Execution using the Typescript SDK**

[Workflow Execution](/workflow-execution) semantics rely on several parameters—that is, to start a Workflow Execution
you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type,
language-specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

In the examples below, all Workflow Executions are started using a Temporal Client. To spawn Workflow Executions from
within another Workflow Execution, use either the Child Workflow or External Workflow APIs.

See the [Customize Workflow Type](/develop/typescript/core-application#workflow-type) section to see how to customize
the name of the Workflow Type.

A request to spawn a Workflow Execution causes the Temporal Service to create the first Event
([WorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#workflowexecutionstarted)) in the Workflow Execution Event History. The
Temporal Service then creates the first Workflow Task, resulting in the first
[WorkflowTaskScheduled](/references/events#workflowtaskscheduled) Event.

When you have a Client, you can schedule the start of a Workflow with `client.workflow.start()`, specifying
`workflowId`, `taskQueue`, and `args` and returning a Workflow handle immediately after the Server acknowledges the
receipt.

```typescript
const handle = await client.workflow.start(example, {
  workflowId: 'your-workflow-id',
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
  args: ['argument01', 'argument02', 'argument03'], // this is typechecked against workflowFn's args
});
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
const result = await handle.result();
```

Calling `client.workflow.start()` and `client.workflow.execute()` send a command to Temporal Server to schedule a new
Workflow Execution on the specified Task Queue. It does not actually start until a Worker that has a matching Workflow
Type, polling that Task Queue, picks it up.

You can test this by executing a Client command without a matching Worker. Temporal Server records the command in Event
History, but does not make progress with the Workflow Execution until a Worker starts polling with a matching Task Queue
and Workflow Definition.

Workflow Execution run in a separate V8 isolate context in order to provide a
[deterministic runtime](/workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints).

### Set a Workflow's Task Queue {#set-task-queue}

In most SDKs, the only Workflow Option that must be set is the name of the [Task Queue](/task-queue).

For any code to execute, a Worker Process must be running that contains a Worker Entity that is polling the same Task
Queue name.

A Task Queue is a dynamic queue in Temporal polled by one or more Workers.

Workers bundle Workflow code and node modules using Webpack v5 and execute them inside V8 isolates. Activities are
directly required and run by Workers in the Node.js environment.

Workers are flexible. You can host any or all of your Workflows and Activities on a Worker, and you can host multiple
Workers on a single machine.

The Worker need three main things:

- `taskQueue`: The Task Queue to poll. This is the only required argument.
- `activities`: Optional. Imported and supplied directly to the Worker.
- Workflow bundle. Choose one of the following options:
  - Specify `workflowsPath` pointing to your `workflows.ts` file to pass to Webpack; for example,
    `require.resolve('./workflows')`. Workflows are bundled with their dependencies.
  - If you prefer to handle the bundling yourself, pass a prebuilt bundle to `workflowBundle`.

```ts
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as activities from './activities';

async function run() {
  // Step 1: Register Workflows and Activities with the Worker and connect to
  // the Temporal server.
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    activities,
    taskQueue: 'hello-world',
  });
  // Worker connects to localhost by default and uses console.error for logging.
  // Customize the Worker by passing more options to create():
  // https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker
  // If you need to configure server connection parameters, see docs:
  // /typescript/security#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls

  // Step 2: Start accepting tasks on the `tutorial` queue
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

`taskQueue` is the only required option; however, use `workflowsPath` and `activities` to register Workflows and
Activities with the Worker.

When scheduling a Workflow, you must specify `taskQueue`.

```ts
import { Client, Connection } from '@temporalio/client';
// This is the code that is used to start a Workflow.
const connection = await Connection.create();
const client = new Client({ connection });
const result = await client.workflow.execute(yourWorkflow, {
  // required
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
  // required
  workflowId: 'your-workflow-id',
});
```

When creating a Worker, you must pass the `taskQueue` option to the `Worker.create()` function.

```ts
const worker = await Worker.create({
  // imported elsewhere
  activities,
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
});
```

Optionally, in Workflow code, when calling an Activity, you can specify the Task Queue by passing the `taskQueue` option
to `proxyActivities()`, `startChild()`, or `executeChild()`. If you do not specify `taskQueue`, the TypeScript SDK
places Activity and Child Workflow Tasks in the same Task Queue as the Workflow Task Queue.

### Set a Workflow Id {#workflow-id}

Although it is not required, we recommend providing your own
[Workflow Id](/workflow-execution/workflowid-runid#workflow-id)that maps to a business process or business entity
identifier, such as an order identifier or customer identifier.

Connect to a Client with `client.workflow.start()` and any arguments. Then specify your `taskQueue` and set your
`workflowId` to a meaningful business identifier.

```typescript
const handle = await client.workflow.start(example, {
  workflowId: 'yourWorkflowId',
  taskQueue: 'yourTaskQueue',
  args: ['your', 'arg', 'uments'],
});
```

This starts a new Client with the given Workflow Id, Task Queue name, and an argument.

### Get the results of a Workflow Execution {#get-workflow-results}

If the call to start a Workflow Execution is successful, you will gain access to the Workflow Execution's Run Id.

The Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace may be used to uniquely identify a Workflow Execution in the system and get its
result.

It's possible to both block progress on the result (synchronous execution) or get the result at some other point in time
(asynchronous execution).

In the Temporal Platform, it's also acceptable to use Queries as the preferred method for accessing the state and
results of Workflow Executions.

To return the results of a Workflow Execution:

```typescript
return 'Completed ' + wf.workflowInfo().workflowId + ', Total Charged: ' + totalCharged;
```

`totalCharged` is just a function declared in your code. For a full example, see
[subscription-workflow-project-template-typescript/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/subscription-workflow-project-template-typescript/blob/main/src/workflows.ts).

A Workflow function may return a result. If it doesn’t (in which case the return type is `Promise<void>`), the result
will be `undefined`.

If you started a Workflow with `client.workflow.start()`, you can choose to wait for the result anytime with
`handle.result()`.

```typescript
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
const result = await handle.result();
```

Using a Workflow Handle isn't necessary with `client.workflow.execute()`.

Workflows that prematurely end will throw a `WorkflowFailedError` if you call `result()`.

If you call `result()` on a Workflow that prematurely ended for some reason, it throws a
[`WorkflowFailedError` error](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowFailedError/) that reflects the
reason. For that reason, it is recommended to catch that error.

```typescript
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
try {
  const result = await handle.result();
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof WorkflowFailedError) {
    throw new Error('Temporal workflow failed: ' + workflowId, {
      cause: err,
    });
  } else {
    throw new Error('error from Temporal workflow ' + workflowId, {
      cause: err,
    });
  }
}
```
