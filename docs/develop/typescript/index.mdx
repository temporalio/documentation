This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the structures, primitives, and features used in [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application) development.

## Core Application

The Core Application section of the Develop with Temporal TypeScript SDK covers the essential concepts and implementation details needed to build and run a Temporal Application.

- [Develop a Basic Workflow](/develop/typescript/core-application#develop-workflows)
- [Develop a Basic Activity](/develop/typescript/core-application#develop-activities)
- [Start an Activity Execution](/develop/typescript/core-application#activity-execution)
- [Run Worker Processes](/develop/typescript/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)

## Temporal Client

The Temporal Client section of the Develop with Temporal TypeScript SDK describes how to use the Temporal Client to connect and start a Workflow Execution.

- [Connect to Development Temporal Service](/develop/typescript/temporal-clients#connect-to-development-service)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](/develop/typescript/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](/develop/typescript/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)

## Test Suites

The Testing section of the Develop with Temporal TypeScript SDK describes how to test your Temporal Application.

- [Test Frameworks](/develop/typescript/testing-suite#test-frameworks)
- [Testing Activities](/develop/typescript/testing-suite#test-activities)
- [Testing Workflows](/develop/typescript/testing-suite#test-workflows)
- [How to Replay a Workflow Execution](/develop/typescript/testing-suite#replay)

## Failure Detection

The Failure Detection section of the Develop with Temporal TypeScript SDK describes how to configure timeouts and heartbeat intervals for Activities and Workflows.

- [Workflow Timeouts](/develop/typescript/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts)
- [Set Activity Timeouts](/develop/typescript/failure-detection#activity-timeouts)
- [Heartbeat an Activity](/develop/typescript/failure-detection#activity-heartbeats)

## Messages

The Messages section of the Develop with Temporal TypeScript SDK describes how to use the Temporal Client to send messages to a Workflow Execution.

- [Develop with Signals](/develop/typescript/message-passing#signals)
- [Develop with Queries](/develop/typescript/message-passing#queries)
- [What is a Dynamic Handler](/develop/typescript/message-passing#dynamic-handler)

## Cancellation

The Cancellation section of the Develop with Temporal TypeScript SDK describes how to cancel a Workflow Execution.

- [Cancellation scopes in Typescript](/develop/typescript/cancellation#cancellation-scopes)

## Asynchronous Activity Completion

The Asynchronous Activity Completion section of the Develop with Temporal TypeScript SDK describes how to complete Activities asynchronously.

- [Asynchronously Complete an Activity](/develop/typescript/asynchronous-activity-completion)

## Versioning

The Versioning section of the Temporal Developer's Guide covers how to update Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [Introduction to Versioning](/develop/typescript/versioning)
- [How to Use the Patching API](/develop/typescript/versioning#typescript-sdk-patching-api)
- [How to Use Worker Versioning](/develop/typescript/versioning#worker-versioning)

## Observability

The Observability section of the Temporal Developer's Guide covers how to configure and use the Temporal Observability APIs.

- [Emit Metrics](/develop/typescript/observability#metrics)
- [Setup Tracing](/develop/typescript/observability#tracing)
- [Log from a Workflow](/develop/typescript/observability#logging)
- [Use Visibility APIs](/develop/typescript/observability#visibility)

## Debugging

The Debugging section of the Temporal Developer's Guide covers the various ways to debug your application.

- [Debugging](/develop/typescript/debugging)

## Schedules

The Schedules section of the Develop with Temporal TypeScript SDK covers how to schedule Workflows, run Workflows on a Cron, and configure Workflows to run on a delay.

- [Schedule a Workflow](/develop/typescript/schedules#schedule-a-workflow)
- [Temporal Cron Jobs](/develop/typescript/schedules#temporal-cron-jobs)
- [Temporal Cron Jobs](/develop/typescript/schedules#temporal-cron-jobs)
- [How to use Start Delay](/develop/typescript/schedules#start-delay)

## Data Encryption

The Converters and Codecs section of the Temporal Developer's Guide provides guidance on how to support compression, encryption, and other special data handling by implementing custom converters and codecs.

- [Custom Payload Codec](/develop/typescript/data-encryption#custom-payload-conversion)

## Child Workflows

The Child Workflows section of the Develop with Temporal TypeScript SDK covers how to spawn a Child Workflow Execution and handle Child Workflow Events.

- [Start a Child Workflow Execution](/develop/typescript/child-workflows)

## Continue-As-New

The Continue-As-New section of the Develop with Temporal TypeScript SDK covers how to create a new Workflow Execution using the same Workflow ID as an existing Workflow Execution.

- [Continue-As-New](/develop/typescript/continue-as-new)

## Timers

The Timers section of the Develop with Temporal TypeScript SDK covers how to use timers and sleeps within Workflows.

- [What is a Timer](/develop/typescript/timers)
