## How to install a Temporal SDK {#install-a-temporal-sdk}

A [Temporal SDK](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks) provides a framework for
[Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application) development.

An SDK provides you with the following:

- A [Temporal Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) to communicate with a
  [Temporal Service](/temporal-service).
- APIs to develop [Workflows](/workflows).
- APIs to create and manage [Worker Processes](/workers#worker).
- APIs to author [Activities](/activity-definition).

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/temporalio.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=author%3Atemporal-sdk-team)

This project requires Node.js 18 or later.

**Create a project**

```bash
npx @temporalio/create@latest ./your-app
```

**Add to an existing project**

```bash
npm install @temporalio/client @temporalio/worker @temporalio/workflow @temporalio/activity @temporalio/common
```

:::note

The TypeScript SDK is designed with TypeScript-first developer experience in mind, but it works equally well with
JavaScript.

### How to find the TypeScript SDK API reference {#api-reference}

The Temporal TypeScript SDK API reference is published to [typescript.temporal.io](https://typescript.temporal.io).

### Where are SDK-specific code examples? {#code-samples}

You can find a complete list of executable code samples in
[Temporal's GitHub repository](https://github.com/temporalio?q=samples-&type=all&language=&sort=).

Additionally, several of the [Tutorials](https://learn.temporal.io) are backed by a fully executable template
application.

Use the [TypeScript samples library](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript) stored on GitHub to demonstrate
various capabilities of Temporal.

**Where can I find video demos?**

### How to import an ECMAScript module {#ecmascript-modules}

The JavaScript ecosystem is quickly moving toward publishing ECMAScript modules (ESM) instead of CommonJS modules. For
example, `node-fetch@3` is ESM, but `node-fetch@2` is CommonJS.

For more information about importing a pure ESM dependency, see our
[Fetch ESM](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/fetch-esm) sample for the necessary configuration
changes:

- `package.json` must have include the `"type": "module"` attribute.
- `tsconfig.json` should output in `esnext` format.
- Imports must include the `.js` file extension.

## Linting and types in TypeScript {#linting-and-types}

If you started your project with `@temporalio/create`, you already have our recommended TypeScript and ESLint
configurations.

If you incrementally added Temporal to an existing app, we do recommend setting up linting and types because they help
catch bugs well before you ship them to production, and they improve your development feedback loop. Take a look at our
recommended [.eslintrc](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/.shared/.eslintrc.js) file and tweak
to suit your needs.
