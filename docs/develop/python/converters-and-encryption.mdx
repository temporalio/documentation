Temporal's security model is designed around client-side encryption of Payloads.
A client may encrypt Payloads before sending them to the server, and decrypt them after receiving them from the server.
This provides a high degree of confidentiality because the Temporal Server itself has absolutely no knowledge of the actual data.
It also gives implementers more power and more freedom regarding which client is able to read which data -- they can control access with keys, algorithms, or other security measures.

A Temporal developer adds client-side encryption of Payloads by providing a Custom Payload Codec to its Client.
Depending on business needs, a complete implementation of Payload Encryption may involve selecting appropriate encryption algorithms, managing encryption keys, restricting a subset of their users from viewing payload output, or a combination of these.

The server itself never adds encryption over Payloads.
Therefore, unless client-side encryption is implemented, Payload data will be persisted in non-encrypted form to the data store, and any Client that can make requests to a Temporal namespace (including the Temporal UI and CLI) will be able to read Payloads contained in Workflows.
When working with sensitive data, you should always implement Payload encryption.

## Custom Payload Codec {#custom-payload-codec}

**How to use a custom Payload Codec using Python with the Temporal Python SDK.**

Custom Data Converters can change the default Temporal Data Conversion behavior by adding hooks, sending payloads to external storage, or performing different encoding steps.
If you only need to change the encoding performed on your payloads -- by adding compression or encryption -- you can override the default Data Converter by creating a new `PayloadCodec`.

The `PayloadCodec` needs to implement `encode()` and `decode()` functions at a minimum.
These should loop through all of a Workflow's payloads, perform all of your necessary marshaling, compression, or encryption steps in order, and set an `"encoding"` metadata field.

In this example the `encode` method marshals and then compresses a payload using Python's [cramjam](https://github.com/milesgranger/cramjam) library to provide `snappy` compression.
The `decode()` function implements the `encode()` logic in reverse:


```python
import cramjam
from temporalio.api.common.v1 import Payload
from temporalio.converter import PayloadCodec

class EncryptionCodec(PayloadCodec):
    async def encode(self, payloads: Iterable[Payload]) -> List[Payload]:
        return [
            Payload(
                metadata={
                    "encoding": b"binary/snappy",
                },
                data=(bytes(cramjam.snappy.compress(p.SerializeToString()))),
            )
            for p in payloads
        ]

    async def decode(self, payloads: Iterable[Payload]) -> List[Payload]:
        ret: List[Payload] = []
        for p in payloads:
            if p.metadata.get("encoding", b"").decode() != "binary/snappy":
                ret.append(p)
                continue
            ret.append(Payload.FromString(bytes(cramjam.snappy.decompress(p.data))))
        return ret
```

This example verifies that an encoded payload matches the `binary/snappy` filetype -- i.e., that it was encoded using the same custom `encode()` function -- and if so, performs decompression followed by unmarshaling.

**Set Data Converter to use custom Payload Codec**

Add a `data_converter` parameter to your `Client.connect()` options that overrides the default Converter with your Payload Codec:

```python
from codec import EncryptionCodec

client = await Client.connect(
	"localhost:7233",
	data_converter=dataclasses.replace(
		temporalio.converter.default(), payload_codec=EncryptionCodec()
	),
)
```

- Data **encoding** is performed by the client using the converters and codecs provided by Temporal or your custom implementation when passing input to the Temporal Cluster. For example, plain text input is usually serialized into a JSON object, and can then be compressed or encrypted.
- Data **decoding** may be performed by your application logic during your Workflows or Activities as necessary, but decoded Workflow results are never persisted back to the Temporal Cluster. Instead, they are stored encoded on the Cluster, and you need to provide an additional parameter when using the [temporal workflow show](/cli/workflow#show) command or when browsing the Web UI to view output.

For reference, see the [Encryption](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/tree/main/encryption) sample.

### Using a Codec Server

A Codec Server is an HTTP server that uses your custom Codec logic to decode your data remotely.
The Codec Server is independent of the Temporal Cluster and decodes your encrypted payloads through predefined endpoints.
You create, operate, and manage access to your Codec Server in your own environment.
The Temporal CLI and the Web UI in turn provide built-in hooks to call the Codec Server to decode encrypted payloads on demand.
Refer to the [Codec Server](/production-deployment/data-encryption) documentation for information on how to design and deploy a Codec Server.

## Payload conversion

Temporal SDKs provide a default [Payload Converter](/dataconversion#payload-converter) that can be customized to convert a custom data type to [Payload](/dataconversion#payload) and back.

### Conversion sequence {#conversion-sequence}

The order in which your encoding Payload Converters are applied depends on the order given to the Data Converter.
You can set multiple encoding Payload Converters to run your conversions.
When the Data Converter receives a value for conversion, it passes through each Payload Converter in sequence until the converter that handles the data type does the conversion.

Payload Converters can be customized independently of a Payload Codec.
Temporal's Converter architecture looks like this:

### Custom Payload Converter {#custom-payload-converter}

**How to use a custom Payload Converter using the Temporal Python SDK.**

Data Converters convert raw Temporal payloads to/from actual Python types.
A custom Data Converter of type `temporalio.converter.DataConverter` can be set via the `data_converter` client parameter.

The default Data Converter supports converting multiple types including:

- `None`
- `bytes`
- `google.protobuf.message.Message` - As JSON when encoding, but has ability to decode binary proto from other languages
- Anything that can be converted to JSON including:
  - Anything that [`json.dump`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dump) supports natively
  - [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
  - Iterables including ones JSON dump may not support by default, e.g. `set`
  - Any class with a `dict()` method and a static `parse_obj()` method, e.g.
    [Pydantic models](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models)
    - The default data converter is deprecated for Pydantic models and will warn if used since not all fields work.
      See [this sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/tree/main/pydantic_converter) for the recommended
      approach.
  - [IntEnum, StrEnum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html) based enumerates
  - [UUID](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html)

This notably doesn't include any `date`, `time`, or `datetime` objects, as they may not work across SDKs.

Users are strongly encouraged to use a single `dataclass` for parameter and return types so fields with defaults can be easily added without breaking compatibility.
Classes with generics may not have the generics properly resolved.
The current implementation does not have generic type resolution. Users should use concrete types.

### Custom Type Data Conversion

When converting from JSON, Workflow and Activity type hints are taken into account to convert to the proper types.
All common Python typings including `Optional`, `Union`, all forms of iterables and mappings, and `NewType` are supported in addition the regular JSON values mentioned before.

In Python, Data Converters contain a reference to a Payload Converter class that is used to convert input and output payloads.
By default, the Payload Converter is a `CompositePayloadConverter` which contains multiple `EncodingPayloadConverter`s to try to serialize/deserialize payloads.
Upon serialization, each `EncodingPayloadConverter` is used in order until one succeeds.

To implement a custom encoding for a custom type, a new `EncodingPayloadConverter` can be created.
For example, to support `IPv4Address` types:

```python
class IPv4AddressEncodingPayloadConverter(EncodingPayloadConverter):
    @property
    def encoding(self) -> str:
        return "text/ipv4-address"

    def to_payload(self, value: Any) -> Optional[Payload]:
        if isinstance(value, ipaddress.IPv4Address):
            return Payload(
                metadata={"encoding": self.encoding.encode()},
                data=str(value).encode(),
            )
        else:
            return None

    def from_payload(self, payload: Payload, type_hint: Optional[Type] = None) -> Any:
        assert not type_hint or type_hint is ipaddress.IPv4Address
        return ipaddress.IPv4Address(payload.data.decode())

class IPv4AddressPayloadConverter(CompositePayloadConverter):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # Just add ours as first before the defaults
        super().__init__(
            IPv4AddressEncodingPayloadConverter(),
            *DefaultPayloadConverter.default_encoding_payload_converters,
        )

my_data_converter = dataclasses.replace(
    DataConverter.default,
    payload_converter_className=IPv4AddressPayloadConverter,
)
```

This is good for many custom types. However, you might need to override the behavior of the just the existing JSON encoding payload converter to support a new type.
It is already the last encoding data converter in the list, so it's the fall-through behavior for any otherwise unknown type.
Customizing the existing JSON converter has the benefit of making the type work in lists, unions, etc.
The conversion can be customized for serialization with a custom `json.JSONEncoder` and deserialization with a custom `JSONTypeConverter`.
For example, to support `IPv4Address` types in existing JSON conversion:

```python
class IPv4AddressJSONEncoder(AdvancedJSONEncoder):
    def default(self, o: Any) -> Any:
        if isinstance(o, ipaddress.IPv4Address):
            return str(o)
        return super().default(o)
class IPv4AddressJSONTypeConverter(JSONTypeConverter):
    def to_typed_value(
        self, hint: Type, value: Any
    ) -> Union[Optional[Any], _JSONTypeConverterUnhandled]:
        if issubclass(hint, ipaddress.IPv4Address):
            return ipaddress.IPv4Address(value)
        return JSONTypeConverter.Unhandled

class IPv4AddressPayloadConverter(CompositePayloadConverter):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # Replace default JSON plain with our own that has our encoder and type
        # converter
        json_converter = JSONPlainPayloadConverter(
            encoder=IPv4AddressJSONEncoder,
            custom_type_converters=[IPv4AddressJSONTypeConverter()],
        )
        super().__init__(
            *[
                c if not isinstance(c, JSONPlainPayloadConverter) else json_converter
                for c in DefaultPayloadConverter.default_encoding_payload_converters
            ]
        )

my_data_converter = dataclasses.replace(
    DataConverter.default,
    payload_converter_className=IPv4AddressPayloadConverter,
)
```

Now `IPv4Address` can be used in type hints including collections, optionals, etc.
