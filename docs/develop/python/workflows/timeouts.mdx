## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Before we continue, we want to note that we generally do not recommend setting Workflow Timeouts, because Workflows are designed to be long-running and resilient.
Instead, setting a Timeout can limit its ability to handle unexpected delays or long-running processes.
If you need to perform an action inside your Workflow after a specific period of time, we recommend using a Timer.

Workflow timeouts are set when [starting the Workflow Execution](#workflow-timeouts).

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-execution-timeout)** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-run-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-task-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

Set the timeout to either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

Available timeouts are:

- `execution_timeout`
- `run_timeout`
- `task_timeout`

        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your timeout argument",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        # Set Workflow Timeout duration
        execution_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
        # run_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
        # task_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
    )
```

## Workflow retries {#workflow-retries}

**How to set a Workflow Retry Policy using the Temporal Python SDK**

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

Set the Retry Policy to either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.
