## Raise and Handle Exceptions {#exception-handling}

In each Temporal SDK, error handling is implemented idiomatically, following the conventions of the language.
Temporal uses several different error classes internally — for example, [`CancelledError`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.exceptions.CancelledError.html) in the Python SDK, to handle a Workflow cancellation. 
You should not raise or otherwise implement these manually, as they are tied to Temporal platform logic.

The one Temporal error class that you will typically raise deliberately is [`ApplicationError`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.exceptions.ApplicationError.html).
In fact, *any* other exceptions that are raised from your Python code in a Temporal Activity will be converted to an `ApplicationError` internally.
This way, an error's type, severity, and any additional details can be sent to the Temporal Service, indexed by the Web UI, and even serialized across language boundaries.

In other words, these two code samples do the same thing:

```python 
class MyCustomError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message, error_code):
        super().__init__(message)
        self.error_code = error_code

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.message} (Error Code: {self.error_code})"

@activity.defn
async def my_activity(input: MyActivityInput):
    try:
        # Your activity logic goes here
    except Exception as e:
        raise MyCustomError(
            f"Error encountered on attempt {attempt}",
        ) from e
```

```python 
from temporalio.exceptions import ApplicationError

@activity.defn
async def my_activity(input: MyActivityInput):
    try:
        # Your activity logic goes here
    except Exception as e:
        raise ApplicationError(
            type="MyCustomError",
            message=f"Error encountered on attempt {attempt}",
        ) from e
```

Depending on your implementation, you may decide to use either method.
One reason to use the Temporal `ApplicationError` class is because it allows you to set an additional `non_retryable` parameter.
This way, you can decide whether an error should not be retried automatically by Temporal.
This can be useful for deliberately failing a Workflow due to bad input data, rather than waiting for a timeout to elapse:

```python
from temporalio.exceptions import ApplicationError

@activity.defn
async def my_activity(input: MyActivityInput):
    try:
        # Your activity logic goes here
    except Exception as e:
        raise ApplicationError(
            type="MyNonRetryableError",
            message=f"Error encountered on attempt {attempt}",
            non_retryable=True,
        ) from e
```

You can alternately specify a list of errors that are non-retryable in your Activity [Retry Policy](#activity-retries).

## Failing Workflows {#workflow-failure}

One of the core design principles of Temporal is that an Activity Failure will never directly cause a Workflow Failure — a Workflow should never return as Failed unless deliberately.
The default retry policy associated with Temporal Activities is to retry them until reaching a certain timeout threshold.
Activities will not actually *return* a failure to your Workflow until this condition or another non-retryable condition is met.
At this point, you can decide how to handle an error returned by your Activity the way you would in any other program.
For example, you could implement a [Saga Pattern](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/python/trip-booking-app/) that uses `try` and `except` blocks to "unwind" some of the steps your Workflow has performed up to the point of Activity Failure.

**You will only fail a Workflow by manually raising an `ApplicationError` from the Workflow code.**
You could do this in response to an Activity Failure, if the failure of that Activity means that your Workflow should not continue:

```python
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ProcessCreditCard, order.Address).Get(ctx, &chargestatus)
if err != nil {
	var applicationErr *temporal.ApplicationError
	if errors.As(err, &applicationErr) {
		logger.Error("Unable to charge credit card", "Error", err)
	}
	return OrderConfirmation{}, err
}
```

This works differently in a Workflow than raising exceptions from Activities.
In an Activity, any Python exceptions or custom exceptions are converted to a Temporal `ApplicationError`.
In a Workflow, any exceptions that are raised other than an explicit Temporal `ApplicationError` will only fail that particular [Workflow Task](https://docs.temporal.io/tasks#workflow-task-execution) and be retried.
This includes any typical Python runtime errors like a `NameError` or a `TypeError` that are raised automatically.
These errors are treated as bugs that can be corrected with a fixed deployment, rather than a reason for a Temporal Workflow Execution to return unexpectedly.

## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

**How to set Workflow timeouts using the Temporal Python SDK**

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Before we continue, we want to note that we generally do not recommend setting Workflow Timeouts, because Workflows are designed to be long-running and resilient.
Instead, setting a Timeout can limit its ability to handle unexpected delays or long-running processes.
If you need to perform an action inside your Workflow after a specific period of time, we recommend using a Timer.

Workflow timeouts are set when [starting the Workflow Execution](#workflow-timeouts).

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-execution-timeout)** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-run-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-task-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

Set the timeout to either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

Available timeouts are:

- `execution_timeout`
- `run_timeout`
- `task_timeout`

    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
# ...
    result = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your timeout argument",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        # Set Workflow Timeout duration
        execution_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
        # run_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
        # task_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
    )
```

### Workflow retries {#workflow-retries}

**How to set a Workflow Retry Policy using the Temporal Python SDK**

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

Set the Retry Policy to either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

</div>

```python
# ...
    handle = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your retry policy argument",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=2)),
    )
```

## Set Activity timeouts {#activity-timeouts}

**How to set an Activity Execution Timeout using the Temporal Python SDK**

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **[Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall [Activity Execution](/activity-execution).
- **[Start-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum time allowed for a single [Activity Task Execution](/tasks#activity-task-execution).
- **[Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-start-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/tasks#activity-task) is scheduled to when a [Worker](/workers#worker) starts that Activity Task.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

Activity options are set as keyword arguments after the Activity arguments.

Available timeouts are:

- schedule_to_close_timeout
- schedule_to_start_timeout
- start_to_close_timeout

  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

# ...
        activity_timeout_result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams(greeting, "Activity Timeout option"),
            # Activity Execution Timeout
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            # schedule_to_start_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            # schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```

### Set an Activity Retry Policy {#activity-retries}

**How to set an Activity Retry Policy using the Temporal Python SDK**

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) if a custom one is not provided.

To create an Activity Retry Policy in Python, set the [RetryPolicy](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.common.RetryPolicy.html) class within the [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) or [`execute_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_activity) function.

  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/activity_timeouts_retires/your_workflows_dacx.py">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
from temporalio.common import RetryPolicy
# ...
        activity_result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams(greeting, "Retry Policy options"),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            # Retry Policy
            retry_policy=RetryPolicy(
                backoff_coefficient=2.0,
                maximum_attempts=5,
                initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=1),
                maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=2),
                # non_retryable_error_types=["ValueError"],
            ),
        )
```

### Override the retry interval with `next_retry_delay` {#next-retry-delay}

To override the next retry interval set by the current policy, pass `next_retry_delay` when raising an [ApplicationError](/references/failures#application-failure) in an Activity.
This value replaces and overrides whatever the retry interval would normally be on the retry policy.

For example, you can set the delay interval based on an Activity's attempt count.
In the following example, the retry delay starts at 3 seconds after the first attempt.
It increases to 6 seconds for the second attempt, 9 seconds for the third attempt, and so forth.
This creates a steadily increasing backoff, versus the exponential approach used by [backoff coefficients](/encyclopedia/retry-policies#backoff-coefficient):

```python
from temporalio.exceptions import ApplicationError
from datetime import timedelta

@activity.defn
async def my_activity(input: MyActivityInput):
    try:
        # Your activity logic goes here
    except Exception as e:
        attempt = activity.info().attempt
        raise ApplicationError(
            f"Error encountered on attempt {attempt}",
            next_retry_delay=timedelta(seconds=3 * attempt),
        ) from e
```

## Heartbeat an Activity {#activity-heartbeats}

**How to Heartbeat an Activity using the Temporal Python SDK**

An [Activity Heartbeat](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat) is a ping from the [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) that is executing the Activity to the [Temporal Service](/temporal-service).
Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Service that the [Activity Execution](/activity-execution) is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.
If the Temporal Service does not receive a Heartbeat within a [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout) time period, the Activity will be considered failed and another [Activity Task Execution](/tasks#activity-task-execution) may be scheduled according to the Retry Policy.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Temporal Service—they may be [throttled](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#throttling) by the Worker.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Temporal Service when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Temporal Service.

To Heartbeat an Activity Execution in Python, use the [`heartbeat()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.activity.html#heartbeat) API.

```python
@activity.defn
async def your_activity_definition() -> str:
    activity.heartbeat("heartbeat details!")
```

In addition to obtaining cancellation information, Heartbeats also support detail data that persists on the server for retrieval during Activity retry.
If an Activity calls `heartbeat(123, 456)` and then fails and is retried, `heartbeat_details` returns an iterable containing `123` and `456` on the next Run.

#### Set a Heartbeat Timeout {#heartbeat-timeout}

**How to set a Heartbeat Timeout using the Temporal Python SDK**

A [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout) works in conjunction with [Activity Heartbeats](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat).

[`heartbeat_timeout`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.StartActivityInput.html#heartbeat_timeout) is a class variable for the [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) function used to set the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.

```python
workflow.start_activity(
    activity="your-activity",
    schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
    heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=1),
)
```

`execute_activity()` is a shortcut for [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) that waits on its result.

To get just the handle to wait and cancel separately, use `start_activity()`. `execute_activity()` should be used in most cases unless advanced task capabilities are needed.

```python
workflow.execute_activity(
    activity="your-activity",
    name,
    schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
    heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=1),
)
```
