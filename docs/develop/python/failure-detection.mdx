## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

**How to set Workflow timeouts using the Temporal Python SDK.**

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when [starting the Workflow Execution](#workflow-timeouts).

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-execution-timeout)** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-run-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-task-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

Set the timeout to either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

Available timeouts are:

- `execution_timeout`
- `run_timeout`
- `task_timeout`

  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
# ...
    result = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your timeout argument",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        # Set Workflow Timeout duration
        execution_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
        # run_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
        # task_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
    )
```

### Workflow retries {#workflow-retries}

**How to set a Workflow Retry Policy using the Temporal Python SDK.**

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

Set the Retry Policy to either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

# ...
    handle = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your retry policy argument",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=2)),
    )
```

## Set Activity timeouts {#activity-timeouts}

**How to set an Activity Execution Timeout using the Temporal Python SDK.**

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **[Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution).
- **[Start-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum time allowed for a single [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution).
- **[Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-start-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/workers#activity-task) is scheduled to when a [Worker](/workers#worker) starts that Activity Task.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

Activity options are set as keyword arguments after the Activity arguments.

Available timeouts are:

- schedule_to_close_timeout
- schedule_to_start_timeout
- start_to_close_timeout

        activity_timeout_result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams(greeting, "Activity Timeout option"),
            # Activity Execution Timeout
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            # schedule_to_start_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            # schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```

### Set an Activity Retry Policy {#activity-retries}

**How to set an Activity Retry Policy using the Temporal Python SDK.**

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) if a custom one is not provided.

To create an Activity Retry Policy in Python, set the [RetryPolicy](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.common.RetryPolicy.html) class within the [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) or [`execute_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_activity) function.

```python
from temporalio.common import RetryPolicy
# ...
        activity_result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams(greeting, "Retry Policy options"),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            # Retry Policy
            retry_policy=RetryPolicy(
                backoff_coefficient=2.0,
                maximum_attempts=5,
                initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=1),
                maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=2),
                # non_retryable_error_types=["ValueError"],
            ),
        )
```

## Heartbeat an Activity {#activity-heartbeats}

**How to Heartbeat an Activity using the Temporal Python SDK.**

An [Activity Heartbeat](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat) is a ping from the [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) that is executing the Activity to the [Temporal Service](/clusters).
Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Service that the [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution) is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.
If the Temporal Service does not receive a Heartbeat within a [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout) time period, the Activity will be considered failed and another [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution) may be scheduled according to the Retry Policy.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Temporal Serviceâ€”they may be [throttled](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#throttling) by the Worker.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Temporal Service when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Temporal Service.

To Heartbeat an Activity Execution in Python, use the [`heartbeat()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.activity.html#heartbeat) API.

```python
@activity.defn
async def your_activity_definition() -> str:
    activity.heartbeat("heartbeat details!")
```

In addition to obtaining cancellation information, Heartbeats also support detail data that persists on the server for retrieval during Activity retry.
If an Activity calls `heartbeat(123, 456)` and then fails and is retried, `heartbeat_details` returns an iterable containing `123` and `456` on the next Run.

#### Set a Heartbeat Timeout {#heartbeat-timeout}

**How to set a Heartbeat Timeout using the Temporal Python SDK.**

A [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout) works in conjunction with [Activity Heartbeats](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat).

[`heartbeat_timeout`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.StartActivityInput.html#heartbeat_timeout) is a class variable for the [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) function used to set the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.

```python
workflow.start_activity(
    activity="your-activity",
    schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
    heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=1),
)
```

`execute_activity()` is a shortcut for [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) that waits on its result.

To get just the handle to wait and cancel separately, use `start_activity()`. `execute_activity()` should be used in most cases unless advanced task capabilities are needed.

```python
workflow.execute_activity(
    activity="your-activity",
    name,
    schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
    heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=1),
)
```
