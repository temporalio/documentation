**How to Continue-As-New using the Temporal Python SDK.**

[Continue-As-New](/workflows#continue-as-new) enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation if the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.
The Workflow Execution spawned from the use of Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.

To Continue-As-New in Python, call the [`continue_as_new()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#continue_as_new) function from inside your Workflow, which will stop the Workflow immediately and Continue-As-New.

class LoopingWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, iteration: int) -> None:
        if iteration == 5:
            return
        await asyncio.sleep(10)
        workflow.continue_as_new(iteration + 1)
```
