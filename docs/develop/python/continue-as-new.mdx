This page answers the following questions for Python developers:

- [What is Continue-As-New?](#what)
- [How to Continue-As-New?](#how)
- [When is it right to Continue-as-New?](#when)
- [How to test Continue-as-New?](#how-to-test)

## What is Continue-As-New? {#what}

[Continue-As-New](/workflow-execution/continue-as-new) enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution. This is necessary when the workflow is approaching certain scaling limits.

Continue-As-New is an atomic operation. The Workflow Execution spawned from the use of Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.

## How to Continue-As-New using the Python SDK. {#how}

To Continue-As-New in Python, call the [`continue_as_new()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#continue_as_new) function from inside your Workflow, which will stop the Workflow immediately and Continue-As-New.

    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn
class LoopingWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, iteration: int) -> None:
        if iteration == 5:
            return
        await asyncio.sleep(10)
        workflow.continue_as_new(iteration + 1)
```

### Considerations for Workflows with Message Handlers

If you're using Updates or Signals, don't call Continue-as-New from the handlers. Instead, make sure your handlers finish running before executing `continue_as_new`. See how with [`all_handlers_finished`](message-passing#wait-for-message-handlers).

## When is it right to Continue-as-New using the Python SDK? {#when}

You should Continue-as-New when your Workflow is in danger of reaching scaling limits.

- the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.
- the Workflow is in danger of receiving too many Updates or Signals.

Temporal tracks when it's right to do so, so you only need to call `workflow.info().is_continue_as_new_suggested()` to see if it's time.

## How to test Continue-as-New using the Python SDK {#how-to-test}

Running test Workflows that will naturally Continue-as-New is slow and expensive. Instead, consider offering a test hook to test your Workflow's Continue-as-New behavior much more cheaply and quickly in automated tests. For example, you could create a test-only variable, `self.max_history_length`, populate it with a smallish value, and write a helper like this inside your Workflow:

<div class="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/blob/main/message_passing/safe_message_handlers/workflow.py">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>
```python
def should_continue_as_new(self) -> bool:
    if workflow.info().is_continue_as_new_suggested():
        return True
    # For testing
    if (
        self.max_history_length
        and workflow.info().get_current_history_length() > self.max_history_length
    ):
        return True
    return False
```

Check this helper each time you're thinking of Continuing-as-New.
