## Signals {#signals}

**How to develop with Signals using the Python SDK.**

A [Signal](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#sending-signals) is a message sent asynchronously to a running Workflow Execution which can be used to change the state and control the flow of a Workflow Execution.
It can only deliver data to a Workflow Execution that has not already closed.

Signals are defined in your code and handled in your Workflow Definition.
Signals can be sent to Workflow Executions from a Temporal Client or from another Workflow Execution.

There are two steps for adding support for a Signal to your Workflow code:

1. **[Defining the Signal](#define-signal)** - You specify the name and data structure used by Temporal Clients when sending the Signal.
2. **[Handling the Signal](#handle-signal)** - You write code that will be invoked when the Signal is received from a Temporal Client.

After defining and handling your Signal, you can send it from a [Temporal Client](#send-signal-from-client) or from another [Workflow Execution](#send-signal-from-workflow).

### Define Signal {#define-signal}

**How to define a Signal using the Python SDK.**

A Signal has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Signal type, is a string.
- The arguments must be serializable.
  To define a Signal, set the Signal decorator [`@workflow.signal`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#signal) on the Signal function inside your Workflow.

Non-dynamic methods can only have positional arguments.
Temporal suggests taking a single argument that is an object or data class of fields that can be added to as needed.

Return values from Signal methods are ignored.

**How to customize names**

You can have a name parameter to customize the Signal's name, otherwise it defaults to the name of the Signal method.

from temporalio import workflow
# ...

    async def submit_greeting(self, name: str) -> None:
        await self._pending_greetings.put(name)

    @workflow.signal
    def exit(self) -> None:
# ...
    @workflow.signal(name="Custom Signal Name")
    async def custom_signal(self, name: str) -> None:
        await self._pending_greetings.put(name)
```

### Handle Signal {#handle-signal}

**How to handle a Signal using the Python SDK.**

Workflows listen for Signals by the Signal's name.

Signal handlers are functions defined in the Workflow that listen for incoming Signals of a given type.
These handlers define how a Workflow should react when it receives a specific type of Signal.

To send a Signal to the Workflow, use the [signal](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#signal) method from the [WorkflowHandle](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html) class.

  </a>

</div>

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
# ...
# ...
    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.submit_greeting, "User 1")
```

### Send a Signal from a Temporal Client {#send-signal-from-client}

**How to send a Signal from a Temporal Client using the Python SDK.**

When a Signal is sent successfully from the Temporal Client, the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.

To send a Signal from the Client, use the [signal()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#signal) function on the Workflow handle.

To get the Workflow handle, you can use any of the following options.

- Use the [get_workflow_handle()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle) method.
- Use the [get_workflow_handle_for()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle_for) method to get a type-safe Workflow handle by its Workflow Id.
- Use the [start_workflow()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) to start a Workflow and return its handle.

</div>

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
# ...
# ...
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = await client.start_workflow(
        GreetingWorkflow.run,
        id="your-greeting-workflow",
        task_queue="signal-tq",
    )
    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.submit_greeting, "User 1")
```

### Send a Signal from a Workflow {#send-signal-from-workflow}

**How to send a Signal from a Workflow using the Python SDK.**

A Workflow can send a Signal to another Workflow, in which case it's called an _External Signal_.

When an External Signal is sent:

- A [SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated) Event appears in the sender's Event History.
- A [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the recipient's Event History.

Use [`get_external_workflow_handle_for`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#get_external_workflow_handle_for) to get a typed Workflow handle to an existing Workflow by its identifier.
Use [`get_external_workflow_handle`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#get_external_workflow_handle) when you don't know the type of the other Workflow.

:::note

The Workflow Type passed is only for type annotations and not for validation.

        handle = workflow.get_external_workflow_handle_for(WorkflowA.run, "workflow-a")
        await handle.signal(WorkflowA.your_signal, "signal argument")
```

### Signal-With-Start {#signal-with-start}

**How to send a Signal-With-Start using the Python SDK.**

Signal-With-Start is used from the Client.
It takes a Workflow Id, Workflow arguments, a Signal name, and Signal arguments.

If there's a Workflow running with the given Workflow Id, it will be signaled. If there isn't, a new Workflow will be started and immediately signaled.

To send a Signal-With-Start in Python, use the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) method and pass the `start_signal` argument with the name of your Signal.

    await client.start_workflow(
        GreetingWorkflow.run,
        id="your-signal-with-start-workflow",
        task_queue="signal-tq",
        start_signal="submit_greeting",
        start_signal_args=["User Signal with Start"],
    )
```

## Queries {#queries}

A [Query](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#sending-queries) is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.

### How to define a Query {#define-query}

A Query has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Query type, is a string.
- The arguments must be [serializable](/dataconversion).

To define a Query, set the Query decorator [`@workflow.query`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#query) on the Query function inside your Workflow.

**Customize names**

You can have a name parameter to customize the Query's name, otherwise it defaults to the name of the Query method.

:::note

You can either set the `name` or the `dynamic` parameter in a Query's decorator, but not both.

  </a>{' '}

</div>

```python
# ...
    @workflow.query
    def greeting(self) -> str:
        return self._greeting
```

### Handle a Query {#handle-query}

**How to handle a Query**

Queries are handled by your Workflow.

Donâ€™t include any logic that causes [Command](/workflows#command) generation within a Query handler (such as executing Activities).
Including such logic causes unexpected behavior.

To send a Query to the Workflow, use the [`query`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#query) method from the [`WorkflowHandle`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html) class.

  </a>{' '}

</div>

```python
# ...
    result = await handle.query(GreetingWorkflow.greeting)
```

### Send a Query {#send-query}

**How to send a Query**

Queries are sent from a Temporal Client.

To send a Query to a Workflow Execution from Client code, use the `query()` method on the Workflow handle.

<div class="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/query_your_workflow/query_dacx.py">

  </a>{' '}

</div>

```python
# ...
    result = await handle.query(GreetingWorkflow.greeting)
```

## Develop with Updates {#updates}

An [Update](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#sending-updates) is an operation that can mutate the state of a Workflow Execution and return a response.

### How to define an Update {#define-update}

Workflow Updates handlers are methods in your Workflow Definition designed to handle updates.
These updates can be triggered during the lifecycle of a Workflow Execution.

**Define an Update Handler**

To define an update handler, use the [@workflow.update](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#update) decorator on a method within your Workflow. This decorator can be applied to both asynchronous and synchronous methods.

- **Decorator Usage:** Apply `@workflow.update` to the method intended to handle updates.
- **Overriding:** If a method with this decorator is overridden, the overriding method should also be decorated with `@workflow.update`.
- **Validator Method:** Optionally, you can define a validator method for the update handler. This validator is specified using `@update_handler_method_name.validator` and is invoked before the update handler.
- **Method Parameters:** Update handlers should only use positional parameters. For non-dynamic methods, it's recommended to use a single parameter that is an object or data class, which allows for future expansion of fields.
- **Return Values:** The update handler can return a serializable value. This value is sent back to the caller of the update.

```python
# ...
    @workflow.update
    async def update_workflow_status(self) -> str:
        self.is_complete = True
        return "Workflow status updated"
```

### Send an Update from a Temporal Client {#send-update-from-client}

**How to send an Update from a Temporal Client**

To send a Workflow Update from a Temporal Client, call the [execute_update](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#execute_update) method on the [WorkflowHandle](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html) class.

```python
# ...
    update_result = await handle.execute_update(
        HelloWorldWorkflow.update_workflow_status
    )
    print(f"Update Result: {update_result}")
```

## Dynamic Handler {#dynamic-handler}

**What is a Dynamic Handler?**

Temporal supports Dynamic Workflows, Activities, Signals, and Queries.
These are unnamed handlers that are invoked if no other statically defined handler with the given name exists.

Dynamic Handlers provide flexibility to handle cases where the names of Workflows, Activities, Signals, or Queries aren't known at run time.

:::caution

Dynamic Handlers should be used judiciously as a fallback mechanism rather than the primary approach.
Overusing them can lead to maintainability and debugging issues down the line.

Instead, Workflows, Activities, Signals, and Queries should be defined statically whenever possible, with clear names that indicate their purpose.
Use static definitions as the primary way of structuring your Workflows.

Reserve Dynamic Handlers for cases where the handler names are not known at compile time and need to be looked up dynamically at runtime.
They are meant to handle edge cases and act as a catch-all, not as the main way of invoking logic.

:::

### Set a Dynamic Signal {#set-a-dynamic-signal}

**How to set a Dynamic Signal**

A Dynamic Signal in Temporal is a Signal that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Signal with the same input is registered.
A Signal can be made dynamic by adding `dynamic=True` to the `@signal.defn` decorator.

The Signal Handler should accept `self`, a string input, and a `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`.
The [payload_converter()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#payload_converter) function is used to convert a `RawValue` object to the desired type.

</div>

```python
# ...
    @workflow.signal(dynamic=True)
    async def dynamic_signal(self, name: str, args: Sequence[RawValue]) -> None:
        await self._pending_greetings.put(name)
```

### Set a Dynamic Query {#set-a-dynamic-query}

**How to set a Dynamic Query**

A Dynamic Query in Temporal is a Query that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Query with the same name is registered.
A Query can be made dynamic by adding `dynamic=True` to the `@query.defn` decorator.

The Query Handler should accept `self`, a string name, and a `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`.
The [payload_converter()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#payload_converter) function is used to convert a `RawValue` object to the desired type.

</div>

```python
# ...
    @workflow.query(dynamic=True)
    def dynamic_query(self, input: str, args: Sequence[RawValue]) -> str:
        return self._greeting
```

### Set a Dynamic Workflow {#set-a-dynamic-workflow}

**How to set a Dynamic Workflow**

A Dynamic Workflow in Temporal is a Workflow that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Workflow with the same name is registered.
A Workflow can be made dynamic by adding `dynamic=True` to the `@workflow.defn` decorator.
You must register the Workflow with the [Worker](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.html) before it can be invoked.

The Workflow Definition must then accept a single argument of type `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`.
The [payload_converter()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#payload_converter) function is used to convert a `RawValue` object to the desired type.

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn(dynamic=True)
class DynamicWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, args: Sequence[RawValue]) -> str:
        name = workflow.payload_converter().from_payload(args[0].payload, str)
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            default_greeting,
            YourDataClass("Hello", name),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```

### Set a Dynamic Activity {#set-a-dynamic-activity}

**How to set a Dynamic Activity**

A Dynamic Activity in Temporal is an Activity that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Activity with the same name is registered.
An Activity can be made dynamic by adding `dynamic=True` to the `@activity.defn` decorator.
You must register the Activity with the [Worker](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.html) before it can be invoked.

The Activity Definition must then accept a single argument of type `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`.
The [payload_converter()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.activity.html#payload_converter) function is used to convert a `RawValue` object to the desired type.

  </a>{' '}

</div>

```python
# ...
@activity.defn(dynamic=True)
async def dynamic_greeting(args: Sequence[RawValue]) -> str:
    arg1 = activity.payload_converter().from_payload(args[0].payload, YourDataClass)
    return (
        f"{arg1.greeting}, {arg1.name}!\nActivity Type: {activity.info().activity_type}"
    )
# ...
@workflow.defn
class GreetingWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            "unregistered_activity",
            YourDataClass("Hello", name),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```
