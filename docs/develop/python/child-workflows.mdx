## Start a Child Workflow Execution {#child-workflows}

**How to start a Child Workflow Execution using the Temporal Python SDK.**

A [Child Workflow Execution](/encyclopedia/child-workflows) is a Workflow Execution that is scheduled from within another Workflow using a Child Workflow API.

When using a Child Workflow API, Child Workflow related Events ([StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#startchildworkflowexecutioninitiated), [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted), [ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutioncompleted), etc...) are logged in the Workflow Execution Event History.

Always block progress until the [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted) Event is logged to the Event History to ensure the Child Workflow Execution has started.
After that, Child Workflow Executions may be abandoned using the default _Abandon_ [Parent Close Policy](/encyclopedia/child-workflows#parent-close-policy) set in the Child Workflow Options.

To be sure that the Child Workflow Execution has started, first call the Child Workflow Execution method on the instance of Child Workflow future, which returns a different future.

Then get the value of an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, which is what waits until the Child Workflow Execution has spawned.

To spawn a Child Workflow Execution in Python, use the [`execute_child_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_child_workflow) function which starts the Child Workflow and waits for completion or
use the [`start_child_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_child_workflow) function to start a Child Workflow and return its handle.
This is useful if you want to do something after it has only started, or to get the Workflow/Run ID, or to be able to signal it while running.

:::note

`execute_child_workflow()` is a helper function for `start_child_workflow()` plus `await handle`.

### Set a Parent Close Policy {#parent-close-policy}

**How to set a Parent Close Policy**

A [Parent Close Policy](/encyclopedia/child-workflows#parent-close-policy) determines what happens to a Child Workflow Execution if its Parent changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, or Timed Out).

The default Parent Close Policy option is set to terminate the Child Workflow Execution.

Set the `parent_close_policy` parameter inside the [`start_child_workflow`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_child_workflow) function or the [`execute_child_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_child_workflow) function to specify the behavior of the Child Workflow when the Parent Workflow closes.

            ComposeGreetingWorkflow.run,
            ComposeGreetingInput("Hello", name),
            id="hello-child-workflow-workflow-child-id",
            parent_close_policy=ParentClosePolicy.ABANDON,
        )
```
