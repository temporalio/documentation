# User Metadata

User metadata allows you to attach arbitrary information to workflows and events in the form of Markdown. This information can be displayed in the Temporal UI, making it easier to identify and understand workflows and their operations.

Users of this feature are cautioned not to put untrusted content into their metadata.

## Adding Metadata

### Workflow

#### Starting a Workflow

When starting a workflow, you can provide a static summary and details to help identify the workflow in the UI:

```python
# Start a workflow with static summary and details
handle = await client.start_workflow(
    YourWorkflow.run,
    "workflow input",
    id="your-workflow-id",
    task_queue="your-task-queue",
    static_summary="Order processing for customer #12345",
    static_details="Processing premium order with expedited shipping"
)
```

The `static_summary` is a single-line description that appears in the workflow list view, with a limit of 200 bytes.
The `static_details` can be multi-line and provides more comprehensive information that appears in the workflow details view, and has a limit of 20K bytes.

You can also use the `execute_workflow` method with the same parameters:

```python
result = await client.execute_workflow(
    YourWorkflow.run,
    "workflow input",
    id="your-workflow-id",
    task_queue="your-task-queue",
    static_summary="Order processing for customer #12345",
    static_details="Processing premium order with expedited shipping"
)
```

#### Inside the Workflow

Within a workflow, you can get and set its _current workflow details_. Unlike static summary/details set at workflow start, this value can be updated throughout the life of the workflow. _Current workflow details_ also takes Markdown format and can span multiple lines. 

```python
@workflow.defn
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, input: str) -> str:
        # Get the current details
        current_details = workflow.get_current_details()
        print(f"Current details: {current_details}")
        
        # Set/update the current details
        workflow.set_current_details("Updated workflow details with new status")
        
        return "Workflow completed"
```

### Activity

You can attach a `summary` to activities when starting them from within a workflow:

```python
@workflow.defn
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, input: str) -> str:
        # Start an activity with a summary
        result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            input,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            summary="Processing user data"
        )
        return result
```

Activity `summary` has a limit of 200 bytes.

### Timer

You can attach a `summary` to timers within a workflow:

```python
@workflow.defn
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, input: str) -> str:
        # Create a timer with a summary
        await workflow.sleep(timedelta(minutes=5), summary="Waiting for payment confirmation")
        return "Timer completed"
```

Timer `summary` has a limit of 200 bytes.
