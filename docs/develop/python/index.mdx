Build [Temporal Applications](/temporal#temporal-application) with the Python SDK.

## [Core Application](/develop/python/core-application)

Use the essential components of a Temporal Application (Workflows, Activities, and Workers) to build and run a Temporal application.

- [Develop a Basic Workflow](/develop/python/core-application#develop-workflows)
- [Develop a Basic Activity](/develop/python/core-application#develop-activities)
- [Start an Activity Execution](/develop/python/core-application#activity-execution)
- [Run Worker Processes](/develop/python/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)

## [Temporal Client](/develop/python/temporal-clients)

Connect to a Temporal Service and start a Workflow Execution.

- [Connect to Development Temporal Service](/develop/python/temporal-clients#connect-to-development-service)
- [Connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Service](/develop/python/temporal-clients#connect-to-a-dev-cluster)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](/develop/python/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](/develop/python/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)

## [Testing](/develop/python/testing-suite)

Set up the testing suite and test Workflows and Activities.

- [Test Frameworks](/develop/python/testing-suite#test-frameworks)
- [Testing Activities](/develop/python/testing-suite#test-activities)
- [Testing Workflows](/develop/python/testing-suite#test-workflows)
- [How to Replay a Workflow Execution](/develop/python/testing-suite#replay)

## [Failure detection](/develop/python/failure-detection)

Explore how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

- [Workflow Timeouts](/develop/python/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts)
- [Set Activity Timeouts](/develop/python/failure-detection#activity-timeouts)
- [Heartbeat an Activity](/develop/python/failure-detection#activity-heartbeats)

## [Workflow message passing](/develop/python/message-passing)

Send messages to and read the state of Workflow Executions.

- [Develop with Signals](/develop/python/message-passing#signals)
- [Develop with Queries](/develop/python/message-passing#queries)
- [Develop with Updates](/develop/python/message-passing#updates)
- [What is a Dynamic Handler](/develop/python/message-passing#dynamic-handler)

## [Interrupt a Workflow feature guide](/develop/python/cancellation)

Interrupt a Workflow Execution with a Cancel or Terminate action.

- [Cancel a Workflow](/develop/python/cancellation#cancellation)
- [Terminate a Workflow](/develop/python/cancellation#termination)
- [Cancel an Activity from a Workflow](/develop/python/cancellation#cancel-activity)

## [Asynchronous Activity completion](/develop/python/asynchronous-activity-completion)

Complete Activities asynchronously.

- [Asynchronously Complete an Activity](/develop/python/asynchronous-activity-completion)

## [Versioning](/develop/python/versioning)

Change Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [Introduction to Versioning](/develop/python/versioning#introduction-to-versioning)
- [How to Use the Patching API](/develop/python/versioning#python-sdk-patching-api)
- [How to Use Worker Versioning](/develop/python/versioning#worker-versioning)

## [Observability](/develop/python/observability)

Configure and use the Temporal Observability APIs.

- [Emit Metrics](/develop/python/observability#metrics)
- [Set up tracing](/develop/python/observability#tracing)
- [Log from a Workflow](/develop/python/observability#logging)
- [Use Visibility APIs](/develop/python/observability#visibility)

## [Debugging](/develop/python/debugging)

Explore various ways to debug your application.

- [Debugging](/develop/python/debugging)

## [Schedules](/develop/python/schedules)

Run Workflows on a schedule and delay the start of a Workflow.

- [Schedule a Workflow](/develop/python/schedules#schedule-a-workflow)
- [Temporal Cron Jobs](/develop/python/schedules#temporal-cron-jobs)
- [Start Delay](/develop/python/schedules#start-delay)

## [Data encryption](/develop/python/converters-and-encryption)

Use compression, encryption, and other data handling by implementing custom converters and codecs.

- [Custom Payload Codec](/develop/python/converters-and-encryption#custom-payload-codec)
- [Payload Conversion](/develop/python/converters-and-encryption#payload-conversion)

## [Durable Timers](/develop/python/timers)

Use Timers to make a Workflow Execution pause or "sleep" for seconds, minutes, days, months, or years.

- [Sleep](/develop/python/timers)

## [Child Workflows](/develop/python/child-workflows)

Explore how to spawn a Child Workflow Execution and handle Child Workflow Events.

- [Start a Child Workflow Execution](/develop/python/child-workflows)

## [Continue-As-New](/develop/python/continue-as-new)

Continue the Workflow Execution with a new Workflow Execution using the same Workflow ID.

- [Continue-As-New](/develop/python/continue-as-new)
