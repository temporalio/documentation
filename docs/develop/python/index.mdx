## [Failure detection](/develop/python/failure-detection)

Explore how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

- [Workflow Timeouts](/develop/python/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts)
- [Set Activity Timeouts](/develop/python/failure-detection#activity-timeouts)
- [Heartbeat an Activity](/develop/python/failure-detection#activity-heartbeats)

## [Workflow message passing](/develop/python/message-passing)

Send messages to and read the state of Workflow Executions.

- [Develop with Signals](/develop/python/message-passing#signals)
- [Develop with Queries](/develop/python/message-passing#queries)
- [Develop with Updates](/develop/python/message-passing#updates)
