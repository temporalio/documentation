These Temporal Python SDK feature guides aim to show how to use Temporal features when developing [Temporal Applications](/temporal#temporal-application).

## Core application

The [Core Application feature guide](/develop/python/core-application) shows how to use the basic building blocks of a Temporal Application (Workflows, Activities, and Workers).

- [Develop a Basic Workflow](/develop/python/core-application#develop-workflows)
- [Develop a Basic Activity](/develop/python/core-application#develop-activities)
- [Start an Activity Execution](/develop/python/core-application#activity-execution)
- [Run Worker Processes](/develop/python/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)

## Temporal Client

The [Temporal Client feature guide](/develop/python/temporal-clients) shows how to connect to a Temporal Service and start a Workflow Execution.

- [Connect to Development Temporal Service](/develop/python/temporal-clients#connect-to-development-service)
- [Connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Service](/develop/python/temporal-clients#connect-to-a-dev-cluster)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](/develop/python/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](/develop/python/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)

## Testing suites

The [Testing suite feature guide](/develop/python/testing-suite) shows how to setup the testing suite and test Workflows and Activities.

- [Test Frameworks](/develop/python/testing-suite#test-frameworks)
- [Testing Activities](/develop/python/testing-suite#test-activities)
- [Testing Workflows](/develop/python/testing-suite#test-workflows)
- [How to Replay a Workflow Execution](/develop/python/testing-suite#replay)

## Failure detection

The [Failure detection feature guide](/develop/python/failure-detection) shows how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

- [Workflow Timeouts](/develop/python/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts)
- [Set Activity Timeouts](/develop/python/failure-detection#activity-timeouts)
- [Heartbeat an Activity](/develop/python/failure-detection#activity-heartbeats)

## Messages

The [Workflow messages feature guide](/develop/python/message-passing) shows how to send messages to and read the state of Workflow Executions.

- [Develop with Signals](/develop/python/message-passing#signals)
- [Develop with Queries](/develop/python/message-passing#queries)
- [Develop with Updates](/develop/python/message-passing#updates)
- [What is a Dynamic Handler](/develop/python/message-passing#dynamic-handler)

## Cancellation

The [Cancellation feature guide](/develop/python/cancellation) shows how to cancel a Workflow Execution.

- [Cancel an Activity from a Workflow](/develop/python/cancellation)

## Asynchronous Activity Completion

The [Asynchronous Activity Completion feature guide](/develop/python/asynchronous-activity-completion) shows how to complete Activities asynchronously.

- [Asynchronously Complete an Activity](/develop/python/asynchronous-activity-completion)

## Versioning

The [Versioning feature guide](/develop/python/versioning) shows how to change Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [Introduction to Versioning](/develop/python/versioning#introduction-to-versioning)
- [How to Use the Patching API](/develop/python/versioning#python-sdk-patching-api)
- [How to Use Worker Versioning](/develop/python/versioning#worker-versioning)

## Observability

The [Observability feature guide](/develop/python/observability) shows how to configure and use the Temporal Observability APIs.

- [Emit Metrics](/develop/python/observability#metrics)
- [Setup Tracing](/develop/python/observability#tracing)
- [Log from a Workflow](/develop/python/observability#logging)
- [Use Visibility APIs](/develop/python/observability#visibility)

## Debugging

The [Debugging feature guide](/develop/python/debugging) covers the various ways to debug your application.

- [Debugging](/develop/python/debugging)

## Schedules

The [Schedules feature guide](/develop/python/schedules) shows how to schedule Workflows, run Workflows on a Cron, and to delay the start of a Workflow.

- [Schedule a Workflow](/develop/python/schedules#schedule-a-workflow)
- [Temporal Cron Jobs](/develop/python/schedules#temporal-cron-jobs)
- [Start Delay](/develop/python/schedules#start-delay)

## Data encryption

The [Data encryption feature guide](/develop/python/data-encryption) provides guidance on how to support compression, encryption, and other data handling by implementing custom converters and codecs.

- [Custom Payload Codec](/develop/python/data-encryption#custom-payload-codec)
- [Payload Conversion](/develop/python/data-encryption#payload-conversion)

## Child Workflows

The [Child Workflows feature guide](/develop/python/child-workflows) shows how to spawn a Child Workflow Execution and handle Child Workflow Events.

- [Start a Child Workflow Execution](/develop/python/child-workflows)

## Continue-As-New

The [Continue-As-New feature guide](/develop/python/continue-as-new) shows how to continue the Workflow Execution with a new Workflow Execution using the same Workflow ID.

- [Continue-As-New](/develop/python/continue-as-new)

## Timers

The [Durable Timers feature guide](/develop/python/timers) shows how to use Timers and sleep within Workflows.

- [Sleep](/develop/python/timers)

## Interrupt a Workflow Execution

The [Interrupt a Workflow feature guide](/develop/python/interrupt-a-workflow-execution) shows how to interrupt a Workflow Execution with a Cancel or Terminate action.

- [Interrupt a Workflow Execution](/develop/python/interrupt-a-workflow-execution)
