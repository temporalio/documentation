## Install and get started

You can find detailed installation instructions for the Python SDK in the [Quickstart](/develop/python/set-up-your-local-python).

There's also a short walkthrough of how to use the Temporal primitives (Activities, Workflows, and Workers) to build and run a Temporal application to get you up and running.

Once your local Temporal Service is set up, continue building with the following resources:

- [Activity Basics](/develop/python/activities/basics)
- [Workflow Basics](/develop/python/workflows/basics)
- [Start an Activity Execution](/develop/python/activities/execution)
- [Run Worker Processes](/develop/python/workers/run-worker-process)

From there, you can dive deeper into any of the Temporal primitives to start building Workflows that fit your use cases.
