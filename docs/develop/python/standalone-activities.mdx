:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Python SDK support for Standalone Activities is at
[Pre-release](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#pre-release).

:::

Standalone Activities are Activity Executions that run independently, without being orchestrated by a Workflow. Instead
of starting an Activity from within a Workflow Definition, you start a Standalone
Activity directly from a Temporal Client.

The Activity definition and Worker registration are identical to regular Activities, and only the execution path differs.

This page covers the following:

- [Run the Temporal Development Server with Standalone Activities enabled](#run-the-temporal-standalone-activity-development-server)
- [Run a worker with the activity registered](#run-worker)
- [Execute a Standalone Activity](#execute-activity)
- [Get the result of a Standalone Activity](#get-activity-result)
- [Get a handle to an existing Standalone Activity](#get-activity-handle)
- [List Standalone Activities](#list-activities)
- [Count Standalone Activities](#count-activities)

:::note

This documentation uses source code derived from the
[Python sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python).
<!-- TODO: Update with actual sample path when available -->

## Run the Temporal Development Server with Standalone Activities enabled {#run-the-temporal-standalone-activity-development-server}

Prerequisites:

- [Install the latest Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/python/core-application#run-a-development-server)
- [Install the latest Temporal Python SDK](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/python/core-application#install-a-temporal-sdk)

The first step in running a Standalone Activity involves starting a Temporal server.

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

This command automatically starts the Temporal development server with the Web UI, and creates the `default` Namespace.
It uses an in-memory database, so do not use it for real use cases.

The Temporal Web UI should now be accessible at [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233), and the Temporal Server
should now be available for client connections on `localhost:7233`.

## Run a worker with the activity registered {#run-worker}

Running a Worker for Standalone Activities is the same as running a Worker for Workflow-driven Activities — you create a
Worker, register the Activity, and run it. The Worker doesn't need to know whether the Activity will be invoked
from a Workflow or as a Standalone Activity. See
[How to develop a Worker in Python](/develop/python/core-application#run-a-dev-worker) for more details on Worker setup and
configuration options.
