The definition code of a Temporal Workflow must be deterministic because Temporal uses event sourcing
to reconstruct the Workflow state by replaying the saved history event data on the Workflow
definition code. This means that any incompatible update to the Workflow Definition code could cause
a non-deterministic issue if not handled correctly.

## Introduction to Versioning

Because we design for potentially long running Workflows at scale, versioning with Temporal works differently. We explain more in this optional 30 minute introduction:

## How to use the Python SDK Patching API {#python-sdk-patching-api}

In principle, the Python SDK's patching mechanism operates similarly to other SDKs in a "feature-flag" fashion. However, the "versioning" API now uses the concept of "patching in" code.

To understand this, you can break it down into three steps, which reflect three stages of migration:

- Running `pre_patch_activity` code while concurrently patching in `post_patch_activity`.
- Running `post_patch_activity` code with deprecation markers for `my-patch` patches.
- Running only the `post_patch_activity` code.

Let's walk through this process in sequence.

Suppose you have an initial Workflow version called `pre_patch_activity`:

<div className="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/version_your_workflows/workflow_1_initial_dacx.py">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
from datetime import timedelta

from temporalio import workflow

with workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():
    from activities import pre_patch_activity
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            pre_patch_activity,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )
```

Now, you want to update your code to run `post_patch_activity` instead. This represents your desired end state.

<div className="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/version_your_workflows/workflow_4_patch_complete_dacx.py">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
from datetime import timedelta

from temporalio import workflow

with workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():
    from activities import post_patch_activity
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            post_patch_activity,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )
```

**Problem: You cannot deploy `post_patch_activity` directly until you're certain there are no more running Workflows created using the `pre_patch_activity` code, otherwise you are likely to cause a nondeterminism error.**

Instead, you'll need to deploy `post_patched_activity` and use the [patched](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#patched) function to determine which version of the code to execute.

Implementing patching involves three steps:

1. Use [patched](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#patched) to patch in new code and run it alongside the old code.
2. Remove the old code and apply [deprecate_patch](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#deprecate_patch).
3. Once you're confident that all old Workflows have finished executing, remove `deprecate_patch`.

### Patching in new code {#using-patched-for-workflow-history-markers}

Using `patched()` inserts a marker into the Workflow History.

<CaptionedImage

    title="Using `patched` inserts a marker into the Workflow History"
    zoom="true"
/>

During replay, if a Worker encounters a history with that marker, it will fail the Workflow task when the Workflow code doesn't produce the same patch marker (in this case, `my-patch`). This ensures you can safely deploy code from `post_patch_activity` as a "feature flag" alongside the original version (`pre_patch_activity`).

    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        if workflow.patched("my-patch"):
            self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
                post_patch_activity,
                schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
            )
        else:
            self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
                pre_patch_activity,
                schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
            )
```

### Understanding deprecated Patches in the Python SDK {#deprecated-patches}

After ensuring that all Workflows started with `pre_patch_activity` code have finished, you can [deprecate the patch](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#deprecate_patch).

Once you're confident that your Workflows are no longer running the pre-patch code paths, you can deploy your code with `deprecate_patch()`.
These Workers will be running the most up-to-date version of the Workflow code, which no longer requires the patch.
The `deprecate_patch()` function works similarly to the `patched()` function by recording a marker in the Workflow history.
This marker does not fail replay when Workflow code does not emit it.
Deprecated patches serve as a bridge between the pre-patch code paths and the post-patch code paths, and are useful for avoiding errors resulting from patched code paths in your Workflow history.

  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        workflow.deprecate_patch("my-patch")
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            post_patch_activity,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )
```

### Safe Deployment of post_patch_activity {#deploy-new-code}

Once you're sure that you will no longer need to Query or Replay any of your pre-patch Workflows, you can then safely deploy Workers that no longer use either the `patched()` or `deprecate_patch()` calls:

<div className="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/version_your_workflows/workflow_4_patch_complete_dacx.py">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            post_patch_activity,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )
```

### Detailed Description of the Patched Function

This video series examines into the behavior of the `patched()` function:

#### Behavior When Not Replaying

If the execution is not replaying, when it encounters a call to `patched()`, it first checks the event history.

- If the patch ID is not in the event history, the execution adds a marker to the event history, upserts a search attribute, and returns `true`.
  This happens in the first block of the patch ID.
- If the patch ID is in the event history, the execution doesn't modify the history, and returns `true`.
  This happens in a patch ID's subsequent blocks, because the event history was updated in the first block.

There is a caveat to this behavior, which we will cover below.

#### Behavior When Replaying With Marker Before-Or-At Current Location

If the execution is replaying and has a call to `patched()`, and if the event history has a marker from a call to `patched()` in the same place
(which means it will match the original event history), then it writes a marker to the replay event history and returns `true`.

This is similar to the behavior of the non-replay case, and
also happens in a given patch ID's first block.

If the code has a call to `patched()`, and the event history
has a marker with that Patch ID earlier in the history,
it will return `true` and will not modify the
replay event history.

This is also similar to the behavior of the non-replay case, and
also happens in a given patch ID's subsequent blocks.

#### Behavior When Replaying With Marker After Current Location

If the Event History's Marker Event is after the current execution point,
that means the new patch is too early.
The execution will encounter the new patch before the original.
The execution will
attempt to write the marker to the replay event
history, but it will throw a non-deterministic
exception because the replay and original event
histories don't match.

#### Behavior When Replaying With No Marker For that Patch ID

During a Replay, if there is no marker for a given patch ID, the execution will return `false` and will not add a marker to
the event history. In addition, all future calls to `patched()`
with that ID will return `false` -- even after it is done replaying
and is running new code.

The [preceding section](#behavior-when-not-replaying) states that if the execution is not replaying,
the `patched()` function will always return `true`. If
the marker doesn't exist, it will be added, and if
the marker already exists, it won't be re-added.

However, this behavior doesn't occur if there was already
a call to `patched()` with that ID in the replay code, but not
in the event history. In this situation, the function won't return
`true`.

#### A Summary of the Two Potentially Unexpected Behaviors

Recapping the potentially unexpected behaviors that may occur during a Replay:

If the execution hits a call to `patched()`, but that patch ID isn't _at or before
that point_ in the event history, you may not realize that
the event history _after_ the current execution location matters.
This behavior occurs because:

- If that patch ID exists later, you get a non-determinism error
- If the patch doesn't exist later, you don't get a non-determinism error, and the call returns `false`

If the execution hits a call to `patched()` with an ID that
doesn't exist in the history, then not only will it return
`false` in that occurence, but it will also return `false` if
the execution surpasses the Replay threshold and is running new code.

#### Implications of the Behaviors

If you deploy new code while Workflows are executing,
any Workflows that were in the middle of executing will Replay
up to the point they were at when the Worker was shut down.
When they do this Replay, they will not follow the `patched()` branches in the code.
For the rest of the execution after they have replayed to the point
before the deployment and worker restart, they will either:

- Use new code if there was no call to `patched()` in the replay code
- If there was a call to `patched()` in the replay code, they will
  run the non-patched code during and after replay

This might sound odd, but it's actually exactly what's needed because
that means that if the future patched code depends on earlier patched code,
then it won't use the new code -- it will use the old code instead.

But if
there's new code in the future, and there was no code earlier in the
body that required the new patch, then it can switch over to the new code,
which it will do.

Note that this behavior means that the Workflow _does not always run
the newest code_. It only does that if not replaying or if replay is
surpassed and there hasn't been a call to `patched()` (with that ID) throughout
the replay.

#### Recommendations

Based on this behavior and the implications, when patching in new code, always put the newest code at the top of an if-patched-block.

<!--SNIPSTART python-patching-example-->

```python
if patched('v3'):
    # This is the newest version of the code.
    # put this at the top, so when it is running
    # a fresh execution and not replaying,
    # this patched statement will return true
    # and it will run the new code.
    pass
elif patched('v2'):
    pass
else:
    pass
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

The following sample shows how `patched()` will behave in a conditional block that's arranged differently.
In this case, the code's conditional block doesn't have the newest code at the top.
Because `patched()` will return `True` when not Replaying (except with the preceding caveats), this snippet will run the `v2` branch instead of `v3` in new executions.

<!--SNIPSTART python-patching-anti-example-->

```python
if patched('v2'):
    # This is bad because when doing a new execution (i.e. not replaying),
    # patched statements evaluate to True (and put a marker
    # in the event history), which means that new executions
    # will use v2, and miss v3 below
    pass
elif patched('v3'):
    pass
else:
  pass
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

### Best Practice of Using Python Dataclasses as Arguments and Returns

As a side note on the Patching API, its behavior is why Temporal recommends using single dataclasses as arguments and returns from Signals, Queries, Updates, and Activities, rather than using multiple arguments.
The Patching API's main use case is to support branching in an `if` block of a method body.
It is not designed to be used to set different methods or method signatures for different Workflow Versions.

Because of this, Temporal recommends that each Signal, Activity, etc, accepts a single dataclass and returns a single dataclass, so the method signature can stay constant, and you can do your versioning logic using `patched()` within the method body.

## How to use Worker Versioning in Python {#worker-versioning}

This feature is coming soon!

For now, please join #safe-deploys in our [Community Slack](https://temporal.io/slack) to find the latest status and pre-release docs.

If you were using a previous pre-release version of Worker Versioning, it's now deprecated.

See [Legacy Worker Versioning](worker-versioning-legacy) if you still need those docs.
