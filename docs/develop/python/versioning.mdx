The definition code of a Temporal Workflow must be deterministic because Temporal uses event sourcing
to reconstruct the Workflow state by replaying the saved history event data on the Workflow
definition code. This means that any incompatible update to the Workflow Definition code could cause
a non-deterministic issue if not handled correctly.

## Introduction to Versioning

Because we design for potentially long running Workflows at scale, versioning with Temporal works differently. We explain more in this optional 30 minute introduction: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkP899WxgzY)

## How to use the Python SDK Patching API {#python-sdk-patching-api}

In principle, the Python SDK's patching mechanism operates similarly to other SDKs in a "feature-flag" fashion. However, the "versioning" API now uses the concept of "patching in" code.

To understand this, you can break it down into three steps, which reflect three stages of migration:

- Running `pre_patch_activity` code while concurrently patching in `post_patch_activity`.
- Running `post_patch_activity` code with deprecation markers for `my-patch` patches.
- Running only the `post_patch_activity` code.

Let's walk through this process in sequence.

Suppose you have an initial Workflow version called `pre_patch_activity`:

<div className="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/version_your_workflows/workflow_1_initial_dacx.py">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
from datetime import timedelta

from temporalio import workflow

with workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():
    from activities import pre_patch_activity
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            pre_patch_activity,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )
```

Now, you want to update your code to run `post_patch_activity` instead. This represents your desired end state.

<div className="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/version_your_workflows/workflow_4_patch_complete_dacx.py">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
from datetime import timedelta

from temporalio import workflow

with workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():
    from activities import post_patch_activity
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            post_patch_activity,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )
```

**Problem: You cannot deploy `post_patch_activity` directly until you're certain there are no more running Workflows created using the `pre_patch_activity` code, otherwise you are likely to cause a nondeterminism error.**

Instead, you'll need to deploy `post_patched_activity` and use the [patched](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#patched) function to determine which version of the code to execute.

Implementing patching involves three steps:

1. Use [patched](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#patched) to patch in new code and run it alongside the old code.
2. Remove the old code and apply [deprecate_patch](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#deprecate_patch).
3. Once you're confident that all old Workflows have finished executing, remove `deprecate_patch`.

### Patching in new code {#using-patched-for-workflow-history-markers}

Using `patched` inserts a marker into the Workflow History.

<CaptionedImage

    title="Using `patched` inserts a marker into the Workflow History"
    zoom="true"
/>

During replay, if a Worker encounters a history with that marker, it will fail the Workflow task when the Workflow code doesn't produce the same patch marker (in this case, `my-patch`). This ensures you can safely deploy code from `post_patch_activity` as a "feature flag" alongside the original version (`pre_patch_activity`).

    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        if workflow.patched("my-patch"):
            self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
                post_patch_activity,
                schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
            )
        else:
            self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
                pre_patch_activity,
                schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
            )
```

### Understanding deprecated Patches in the Python SDK {#deprecated-patches}

After ensuring that all Workflows started with `pre_patch_activity` code have finished, you can [deprecate the patch](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#deprecate_patch).

Once you're confident that your Workflows are no longer running the pre-patch code paths, you can deploy your code with `deprecate_patch()`.
These Workers will be running the most up-to-date version of the Workflow code, which no longer requires the patch.
The `deprecate_patch()` function works similarly to the `patched()` function by recording a marker in the Workflow history.
This marker does not fail replay when Workflow code does not emit it.
Deprecated patches serve as a bridge between the pre-patch code paths and the post-patch code paths, and are useful for avoiding errors resulting from patched code paths in your Workflow history.

  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/version_your_workflows/workflow_3_patch_deprecated_dacx.py">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        workflow.deprecate_patch("my-patch")
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            post_patch_activity,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )
```

### Safe Deployment of post_patch_activity {#deploy-new-code}

Once you're sure that you will no longer need to Query or Replay any of your pre-patch Workflows, you can then safely deploy Workers that no longer use either the `patched()` or `deprecate_patch()` calls:

<div className="copycode-notice-container">
  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/version_your_workflows/workflow_4_patch_complete_dacx.py">
    View the source code
  </a>{' '}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn
class MyWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        self._result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            post_patch_activity,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )
```

## How to use Worker Versioning in Python {#worker-versioning}

This feature is coming soon!

For now, please join #safe-deploys in our [Community Slack](https://temporal.io/slack) to find the latest status and pre-release docs.

If you were using a previous pre-release version of Worker Versioning, it's now deprecated.

See [Legacy Worker Versioning](worker-versioning-legacy) if you still need those docs.
