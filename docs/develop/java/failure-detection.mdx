## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when [starting the Workflow Execution](#workflow-timeouts).

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/workflows#workflow-execution-timeout)** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/workflows#workflow-run-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/workflows#workflow-task-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

Create an instance of [`WorkflowStub`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowStub.html) in the Client code and set your timeout.

Available timeouts are:

- [setWorkflowExecutionTimeout()](<https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html#setWorkflowExecutionTimeout(java.time.Duration)>)
- [setWorkflowRunTimeout()](<https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html#setWorkflowRunTimeout(java.time.Duration)>)
- [setWorkflowTaskTimeout()](<https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html#setWorkflowTaskTimeout(java.time.Duration)>)

```java
//create Workflow stub for YourWorkflowInterface
YourWorkflowInterface workflow1 =
    WorkerGreet.greetclient.newWorkflowStub(
        GreetWorkflowInterface.class,
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                .setWorkflowId("YourWorkflow")
                .setTaskQueue(WorkerGreet.TASK_QUEUE)
                // Set Workflow Timeout duration
                .setWorkflowExecutionTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                // .setWorkflowRunTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                // .setWorkflowTaskTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                .build());
```

### Workflow retries {#workflow-retries}

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/retry-policies) to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

To set a Workflow Retry Options in the [`WorkflowStub`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowStub.html) instance use [`WorkflowOptions.Builder.setWorkflowRetryOptions`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html).

- Type: `RetryOptions`
- Default: `Null` which means no retries will be attempted.

```java
//create Workflow stub for GreetWorkflowInterface
GreetWorkflowInterface workflow1 =
    WorkerGreet.greetclient.newWorkflowStub(
        GreetWorkflowInterface.class,
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                .setWorkflowId("GreetWF")
                .setTaskQueue(WorkerGreet.TASK_QUEUE)
                // Set Workflow Retry Options
                .setRetryOptions(RetryOptions.newBuilder()
                .build());
```

## How to set Activity timeouts {#activity-timeouts}

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **[Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution).
- **[Start-To-Close Timeout](/activities#start-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum time allowed for a single [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution).
- **[Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/activities#schedule-to-start-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/workers#activity-task) is scheduled to when a [Worker](/workers#worker) starts that Activity Task.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

Set your Activity Timeout from the [`ActivityOptions.Builder`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/activity/ActivityOptions.Builder.html) class.

Available timeouts are:

- ScheduleToCloseTimeout()
- ScheduleToStartTimeout()
- StartToCloseTimeout()

You can set Activity Options using an `ActivityStub` within a Workflow implementation, or per-Activity using `WorkflowImplementationOptions` within a Worker.

The following uses `ActivityStub`.

```java
GreetingActivities activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(GreetingActivities.class,
                ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setScheduleToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                        // .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2)
                        // .setScheduletoCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(20))
                        .build());
```

The following uses `WorkflowImplementationOptions`.

```java
WorkflowImplementationOptions options =
            WorkflowImplementationOptions.newBuilder()
                    .setActivityOptions(
                            ImmutableMap.of(
                                    "GetCustomerGreeting",
                                    // Set Activity Execution timeout
                                    ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                                        .setScheduleToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                                        // .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
                                        // .setScheduleToStartTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                                        .build()))
                    .build();
```

:::note

If you define options per-Activity Type options with `WorkflowImplementationOptions.setActivityOptions()`, setting them again specifically with `ActivityStub` in a Workflow will override this setting.

### How to set an Activity Retry Policy {#activity-retries}

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default [Retry Policy](/retry-policies) if a custom one is not provided.

To set a Retry Policy, known as the [Retry Options](/retry-policies) in Java, use [`ActivityOptions.newBuilder.setRetryOptions()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/activity/ActivityOptions.Builder.html).

- Type: `RetryOptions`
- Default: Server-defined Activity Retry policy.

- With `ActivityStub`

  ```java
  private final ActivityOptions options =
      ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
          // note that either StartToCloseTimeout or ScheduleToCloseTimeout are
          // required when setting Activity options.
          .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
          .setRetryOptions(
              RetryOptions.newBuilder()
                  .setInitialInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
                  .setMaximumInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                  .build())
          .build();
  ```

- With `WorkflowImplementationOptions`

  ```java
  WorkflowImplementationOptions options =
          WorkflowImplementationOptions.newBuilder()
                 .setActivityOptions(
                      ImmutableMap.of(
                          "EmailCustomerGreeting",
                          ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                                // note that either StartToCloseTimeout or ScheduleToCloseTimeout are
                                // required when setting Activity options.
                                .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                                .setRetryOptions(
                                      RetryOptions.newBuilder()
                                          .setDoNotRetry(NullPointerException.class.getName())
                                          .build())
                                .build()))
                .build();
  ```

## How to Heartbeat an Activity {#activity-heartbeats}

An [Activity Heartbeat](/activities#activity-heartbeat) is a ping from the [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) that is executing the Activity to the [Temporal Cluster](/clusters).
Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Cluster that the [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution) is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.
If the Cluster does not receive a Heartbeat within a [Heartbeat Timeout](/activities#heartbeat-timeout) time period, the Activity will be considered failed and another [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution) may be scheduled according to the Retry Policy.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Clusterâ€”they may be [throttled](/activities#throttling) by the Worker.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Cluster when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Cluster.

To Heartbeat an Activity Execution in Java, use the `Activity.getExecutionContext().heartbeat()` Class method.

```java
public class YourActivityDefinitionImpl implements YourActivityDefinition {

  @Override
  public String yourActivityMethod(YourActivityMethodParam param) {
    // ...
    Activity.getExecutionContext().heartbeat(details);
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

The method takes an optional argument, the `details` variable above that represents latest progress of the Activity Execution.
This method can take a variety of types such as an exception object, custom object, or string.

If the Activity Execution times out, the last Heartbeat `details` are included in the thrown `ActivityTimeoutException`, which can be caught by the calling Workflow.
The Workflow can then use the `details` information to pass to the next Activity invocation if needed.

In the case of Activity retries, the last Heartbeat's `details` are available and can be extracted from the last failed attempt by using `Activity.getExecutionContext().getHeartbeatDetails(Class<V> detailsClass)`

#### How to set a Heartbeat Timeout {#heartbeat-timeout}

A [Heartbeat Timeout](/activities#heartbeat-timeout) works in conjunction with [Activity Heartbeats](/activities#activity-heartbeat).

To set a [Heartbeat Timeout](/activities#heartbeat-timeout), use [`ActivityOptions.newBuilder.setHeartbeatTimeout`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/activity/ActivityOptions.Builder.html).

- Type: `Duration`
- Default: None

You can set Activity Options using an `ActivityStub` within a Workflow implementation, or per-Activity using `WorkflowImplementationOptions` within a Worker.
Note that if you define options per-Activity Type options with `WorkflowImplementationOptions.setActivityOptions()`, setting them again specifically with `ActivityStub` in a Workflow will override this setting.

- With `ActivityStub`

  ```java
  private final GreetingActivities activities =
      Workflow.newActivityStub(
          GreetingActivities.class,
          ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
              // note that either StartToCloseTimeout or ScheduleToCloseTimeout are
              // required when setting Activity options.
              .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
              .setHeartbeatTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
              .build());
  ```

- With `WorkflowImplementationOptions`

  ```java
  WorkflowImplementationOptions options =
              WorkflowImplementationOptions.newBuilder()
                      .setActivityOptions(
                              ImmutableMap.of(
                                "EmailCustomerGreeting",
                                      ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                                          // note that either StartToCloseTimeout or ScheduleToCloseTimeout are
                                          // required when setting Activity options.
                                            .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                                            .setHeartbeatTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
                                            .build()))
                      .build();
  ```


#### How to set a Parent Close Policy {#parent-close-policy}

A [Parent Close Policy](/encyclopedia/child-workflows#parent-close-policy) determines what happens to a Child Workflow Execution if its Parent changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, or Timed Out).

The default Parent Close Policy option is set to terminate the Child Workflow Execution.

Set [Parent Close Policy](/encyclopedia/child-workflows#parent-close-policy) on an instance of `ChildWorkflowOptions` using [`ChildWorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setParentClosePolicy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/workflow/ChildWorkflowOptions.Builder.html).

- Type: `ChildWorkflowOptions.Builder`
- Default: `PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_TERMINATE`

```java
 public void parentWorkflow() {
     ChildWorkflowOptions options =
        ChildWorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
            .setParentClosePolicy(ParentClosePolicy.PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_ABANDON)
            .build();
     MyChildWorkflow child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(MyChildWorkflow.class, options);
     Async.procedure(child::<workflowMethod>, <args>...);
     Promise<WorkflowExecution> childExecution = Workflow.getWorkflowExecution(child);
     // Wait for child to start
     childExecution.get()
}
```

In this example, we are:

1. Setting `ChildWorkflowOptions.ParentClosePolicy` to `ABANDON` when creating a Child Workflow stub.
2. Starting Child Workflow Execution asynchronously using `Async.function` or `Async.procedure`.
3. Calling `Workflow.getWorkflowExecution(â€¦)` on the child stub.
4. Waiting for the `Promise` returned by `getWorkflowExecution` to complete.
   This indicates whether the Child Workflow started successfully (or failed).
5. Completing parent Workflow Execution asynchronously.

Steps 3 and 4 are needed to ensure that a Child Workflow Execution starts before the parent closes.
If the parent initiates a Child Workflow Execution and then completes immediately after, the Child Workflow will never execute.
