## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

**How to set Workflow timeouts using the Java SDK.**

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when [starting the Workflow Execution](#workflow-timeouts).

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-execution-timeout)** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-run-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-task-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

Create an instance of [`WorkflowStub`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowStub.html) in the Client code and set your timeout.

Available timeouts are:

- [setWorkflowExecutionTimeout()](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html#setWorkflowExecutionTimeout(java.time.Duration))
- [setWorkflowRunTimeout()](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html#setWorkflowRunTimeout(java.time.Duration))
- [setWorkflowTaskTimeout()](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html#setWorkflowTaskTimeout(java.time.Duration))

```java
//create Workflow stub for YourWorkflowInterface
YourWorkflowInterface workflow1 =
    WorkerGreet.greetclient.newWorkflowStub(
        GreetWorkflowInterface.class,
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                .setWorkflowId("YourWorkflow")
                .setTaskQueue(WorkerGreet.TASK_QUEUE)
                // Set Workflow Timeout duration
                .setWorkflowExecutionTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                // .setWorkflowRunTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                // .setWorkflowTaskTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                .build());
```

### Workflow Retry Policy {#workflow-retries}

**How to set a Workflow Retry Policy in Java.**

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

To set a Workflow Retry Options in the [`WorkflowStub`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowStub.html) instance use [`WorkflowOptions.Builder.setWorkflowRetryOptions`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html).

- Type: `RetryOptions`
- Default: `Null` which means no retries will be attempted.

```java
//create Workflow stub for GreetWorkflowInterface
GreetWorkflowInterface workflow1 =
    WorkerGreet.greetclient.newWorkflowStub(
        GreetWorkflowInterface.class,
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                .setWorkflowId("GreetWF")
                .setTaskQueue(WorkerGreet.TASK_QUEUE)
                // Set Workflow Retry Options
                .setRetryOptions(RetryOptions.newBuilder()
                .build());
```

## Activity timeouts {#activity-timeouts}

**How to set Activity timeouts using the Java SDK.**

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **[Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution).
- **[Start-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum time allowed for a single [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution).
- **[Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-start-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/workers#activity-task) is scheduled to when a [Worker](/workers#worker) starts that Activity Task.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

Set your Activity Timeout from the [`ActivityOptions.Builder`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/activity/ActivityOptions.Builder.html) class.

Available timeouts are:

- ScheduleToCloseTimeout()
- ScheduleToStartTimeout()
- StartToCloseTimeout()

You can set Activity Options using an `ActivityStub` within a Workflow implementation, or per-Activity using `WorkflowImplementationOptions` within a Worker.

The following uses `ActivityStub`.

```java
GreetingActivities activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(GreetingActivities.class,
                ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setScheduleToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                        // .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2)
                        // .setScheduletoCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(20))
                        .build());
```

The following uses `WorkflowImplementationOptions`.

```java
WorkflowImplementationOptions options =
            WorkflowImplementationOptions.newBuilder()
                    .setActivityOptions(
                            ImmutableMap.of(
                                    "GetCustomerGreeting",
                                    // Set Activity Execution timeout
                                    ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                                        .setScheduleToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                                        // .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
                                        // .setScheduleToStartTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                                        .build()))
                    .build();
```

:::note

If you define options per-Activity Type options with `WorkflowImplementationOptions.setActivityOptions()`, setting them again specifically with `ActivityStub` in a Workflow will override this setting.

### Custom Activity Retry Policy {#activity-retries}

**How to set a custom Activity Retry Policy in Java.**

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) if a custom one is not provided.

To set a Retry Policy, known as the [Retry Options](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) in Java, use [`ActivityOptions.newBuilder.setRetryOptions()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/activity/ActivityOptions.Builder.html).

- Type: `RetryOptions`
- Default: Server-defined Activity Retry policy.

- With `ActivityStub`

  ```java
  private final ActivityOptions options =
      ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
          // note that either StartToCloseTimeout or ScheduleToCloseTimeout are
          // required when setting Activity options.
          .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
          .setRetryOptions(
              RetryOptions.newBuilder()
                  .setInitialInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
                  .setMaximumInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                  .build())
          .build();
  ```

- With `WorkflowImplementationOptions`

  ```java
  WorkflowImplementationOptions options =
          WorkflowImplementationOptions.newBuilder()
                 .setActivityOptions(
                      ImmutableMap.of(
                          "EmailCustomerGreeting",
                          ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                                // note that either StartToCloseTimeout or ScheduleToCloseTimeout are
                                // required when setting Activity options.
                                .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                                .setRetryOptions(
                                      RetryOptions.newBuilder()
                                          .setDoNotRetry(NullPointerException.class.getName())
                                          .build())
                                .build()))
                .build();
  ```

### Overriding the retry interval with Next Retry Delay {#next-retry-delay}

You may throw an [Application Failure](/references/failures#application-failure) with the NextRetryDelay field set. This value will replace and override whatever the retry interval would be on the retry policy.

For example, if in an activity, you want to base the interval on the number of attempts, you might do:

```java
int attempt = Activity.getExecutionContext().getInfo().getAttempt();

throw ApplicationFailure.newFailureWithCauseAndDelay(
    "Something bad happened on attempt " + attempt,
    "my_failure_type",
    null,
    3 * Duration.ofSeconds(attempt));
```

## Heartbeat an Activity {#activity-heartbeats}

**How to Heartbeat an Activity using the Java SDK.**

An [Activity Heartbeat](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat) is a ping from the [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) that is executing the Activity to the [Temporal Service](/clusters).
Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Service that the [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution) is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.
If the Temporal Service does not receive a Heartbeat within a [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout) time period, the Activity will be considered failed and another [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution) may be scheduled according to the Retry Policy.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Temporal Service—they may be [throttled](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#throttling) by the Worker.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Temporal Service when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Temporal Service.

To Heartbeat an Activity Execution in Java, use the `Activity.getExecutionContext().heartbeat()` Class method.

```java
public class YourActivityDefinitionImpl implements YourActivityDefinition {

  @Override
  public String yourActivityMethod(YourActivityMethodParam param) {
    // ...
    Activity.getExecutionContext().heartbeat(details);
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

The method takes an optional argument, the `details` variable above that represents latest progress of the Activity Execution.
This method can take a variety of types such as an exception object, custom object, or string.

If the Activity Execution times out, the last Heartbeat `details` are included in the thrown `ActivityTimeoutException`, which can be caught by the calling Workflow.
The Workflow can then use the `details` information to pass to the next Activity invocation if needed.

In the case of Activity retries, the last Heartbeat's `details` are available and can be extracted from the last failed attempt by using `Activity.getExecutionContext().getHeartbeatDetails(Class<V> detailsClass)`

### Heartbeat Timeout {#heartbeat-timeout}

**How to set a Heartbeat Timeout using the Java SDK.**

A [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout) works in conjunction with [Activity Heartbeats](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat).

To set a [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout), use [`ActivityOptions.newBuilder.setHeartbeatTimeout`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/activity/ActivityOptions.Builder.html).

- Type: `Duration`
- Default: None

You can set Activity Options using an `ActivityStub` within a Workflow implementation, or per-Activity using `WorkflowImplementationOptions` within a Worker.
Note that if you define options per-Activity Type options with `WorkflowImplementationOptions.setActivityOptions()`, setting them again specifically with `ActivityStub` in a Workflow will override this setting.

- With `ActivityStub`

  ```java
  private final GreetingActivities activities =
      Workflow.newActivityStub(
          GreetingActivities.class,
          ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
              // note that either StartToCloseTimeout or ScheduleToCloseTimeout are
              // required when setting Activity options.
              .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
              .setHeartbeatTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
              .build());
  ```

- With `WorkflowImplementationOptions`

  ```java
  WorkflowImplementationOptions options =
              WorkflowImplementationOptions.newBuilder()
                      .setActivityOptions(
                              ImmutableMap.of(
                                "EmailCustomerGreeting",
                                      ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                                          // note that either StartToCloseTimeout or ScheduleToCloseTimeout are
                                          // required when setting Activity options.
                                            .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                                            .setHeartbeatTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
                                            .build()))
                      .build();
  ```
