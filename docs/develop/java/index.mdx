Build [Temporal Applications](/temporal#temporal-application) with the Java SDK.

## [Core application](/develop/java/core-application)

Use the essential components of a Temporal Application (Workflows, Activities, and Workers) to build and run a Temporal application.

- [How to develop a Workflow Definition in Java](/develop/java/core-application#develop-workflows)
- [How to develop a basic Activity](/develop/java/core-application#develop-activities)
- [How to start an Activity Execution](/develop/java/core-application#activity-execution)
- [How to develop a Worker Program in Java](/develop/java/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)

## [Temporal Client](/develop/java/temporal-clients)

Connect to a Temporal Service and start a Workflow Execution.

- [Connect to a development Temporal Service](/develop/java/temporal-clients#connect-to-development-service)
- [Connect to a custom Namespace](/develop/java/temporal-clients#connect-to-custom-namespace)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](/develop/java/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](/develop/java/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)

## [Testing](/develop/java/testing-suite)

Set up the testing suite and test Workflows and Activities.

- [Test frameworks](/develop/java/testing-suite#test-frameworks)
- [Test Activities](/develop/java/testing-suite#test-activities)
- [Testing Workflows](/develop/java/testing-suite#test-workflows)
- [How to Replay a Workflow Execution](/develop/java/testing-suite#replay)


## [Failure detection](/develop/java/failure-detection)

Explore how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

- [Workflow timeouts](/develop/java/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts)
- [How to set Activity timeouts](/develop/java/failure-detection#activity-timeouts)
- [How to Heartbeat an Activity](/develop/java/failure-detection#activity-heartbeats)

## [Workflow message passing](/develop/java/message-passing)

Send messages to and read the state of Workflow Executions.

- [How to develop with Signals](/develop/java/message-passing#signals)
- [How to develop with Queries](/develop/java/message-passing#queries)
- [What is a Dynamic Handler?](/develop/java/message-passing#dynamic-handler)
- [How to develop with Updates](/develop/java/message-passing#updates)

## [Asynchronous Activity completion](/develop/java/asynchronous-activity-completion)

Complete Activities asynchronously.

- [How to asynchronously complete an Activity](/develop/java/asynchronous-activity-completion)

## [Versioning](/develop/java/versioning)

Change Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [How to patch Workflows in Java](/develop/java/versioning#patching)
- [How to use Worker Versioning in Java](/develop/java/versioning#worker-versioning)


## [Observability](/develop/java/observability)

Configure and use the Temporal Observability APIs.

- [How to emit metrics](/develop/java/observability#metrics)
- [How to setup Tracing](/develop/java/observability#tracing)
- [How to log from a Workflow](/develop/java/observability#logging)
- [How to use Visibility APIs](/develop/java/observability#visibility)


## [Debugging](/develop/java/debugging)

Explore various ways to debug your application.

- [How to debug in a development environment](/develop/java/debugging#debug-in-a-development-environment)
- [How to debug in a production environment](/develop/java/debugging#debug-in-a-production-environment)

## [Schedules](/develop/java/schedules)

Run Workflows on a schedule and delay the start of a Workflow.

- [How to Schedule a Workflow](/develop/java/schedules#schedule-a-workflow)
- [How to set a Cron Schedule in Java](/develop/java/schedules#cron-schedule)

## [Data encryption](/develop/java/converters-and-encryption)

Use compression, encryption, and other data handling by implementing custom converters and codecs.

- [How to use a custom Payload Codec in Java](/develop/java/converters-and-encryption#custom-payload-codec)
- [How to use custom Payload conversion](/develop/java/converters-and-encryption#custom-payload-conversion)

- [Set a Parent Close Policy](/develop/java/child-workflows#parent-close-policy)

## [Continue-As-New](/develop/java/continue-as-new)

Continue the Workflow Execution with a new Workflow Execution using the same Workflow ID.

- [Continue a Workflow as New](/develop/java/continue-as-new)

## [Durable Timers](/develop/java/timers)
