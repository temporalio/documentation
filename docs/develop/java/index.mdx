## Install and get started

You can find detailed installation instructions for the Java SDK in the [Quickstart](/develop/java/set-up-your-local-java).

There's also a short walkthrough of how to use the Temporal primitives (Activities, Workflows, and Workers) to build and run a Temporal application to get you up and running.

Once your local Temporal Service is set up, continue building with the following resources:

- [Develop a Basic Activity](/develop/java/activities/basic-activity)
- [Develop a Basic Workflow](/develop/java/workflows/basic-workflow)
- [Start an Activity Execution](/develop/java/activities/execution)
- [Run Worker Processes](/develop/java/workers/run-worker-process)

From there, you can dive deeper into any of the Temporal primitives to start building Workflows that fit your use cases.
