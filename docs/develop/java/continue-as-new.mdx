description: Learn how to use Continue-As-New with the Java SDK to manage Workflow Executions efficiently in Temporal, ensuring optimal Event History management and flexible Workflow transitions.
---

This page shows how to Continue-As-New using the Java SDK.

[Continue-As-New](/workflows#continue-as-new) enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation if the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.
The Workflow Execution spawned from the use of Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.

Temporal SDK allows you to use [Continue-As-New](/workflows#continue-as-new) in various ways.

To continue execution of the same Workflow that is currently running, use:

```java
Workflow.continueAsNew(input1, ...);
```

To continue execution of a currently running Workflow as a completely different Workflow Type, use `Workflow.newContinueAsNewStub()`.
For example, in a Workflow class called `YourWorkflow`, we can create a Workflow stub with a different type, and call its Workflow method to continue execution as that type:

```java
MyOtherWorkflow continueAsNew = Workflow.newContinueAsNewStub(MyOtherWorkflow.class);
coninueAsNew.greet(input);
```

To provide `ContinueAsNewOptions` options in `Workflow.newContinueAsNewStub()` use:

```java
ContinueAsNewOptions options = ContinueAsNewOptions.newBuilder()
        .setTaskQueue("newTaskQueueName")
        .build();

MyOtherWorkflow continueAsNew = Workflow.newContinueAsNewStub(MyOtherWorkflow.class, options);
// ...
continueAsNew.greet(input);
```

Providing these options allows you to continue Workflow Execution as a new Workflow run, with a different Workflow Type, and on a different Task Queue.

:::warning Using Continue-as-New and Updates

- Temporal _does not_ support Continue-as-New functionality within Update handlers.
- Complete all handlers _before_ using Continue-as-New.
- Use Continue-as-New from your main Workflow Definition method, just as you would complete or fail a Workflow Execution.
