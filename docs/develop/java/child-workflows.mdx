## How to start a Child Workflow Execution {#child-workflows}

A [Child Workflow Execution](/encyclopedia/child-workflows) is a Workflow Execution that is scheduled from within another Workflow using a Child Workflow API.

When using a Child Workflow API, Child Workflow related Events ([StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#startchildworkflowexecutioninitiated), [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted), [ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutioncompleted), etc...) are logged in the Workflow Execution Event History.

Always block progress until the [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted) Event is logged to the Event History to ensure the Child Workflow Execution has started.
After that, Child Workflow Executions may be abandoned using the default _Abandon_ [Parent Close Policy](/encyclopedia/child-workflows#parent-close-policy) set in the Child Workflow Options.

To be sure that the Child Workflow Execution has started, first call the Child Workflow Execution method on the instance of Child Workflow future, which returns a different future.

Then get the value of an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, which is what waits until the Child Workflow Execution has spawned.

The first call to the Child Workflow stub must always be its Workflow method (method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`).
Similar to Activities, invoking Child Workflow methods can be made synchronous or asynchronous by using `Async#function` or `Async#procedure`.
The synchronous call blocks until a Child Workflow method completes.
The asynchronous call returns a `Promise` which can be used to wait for the completion of the Child Workflow method, as in the following example:

```java
GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);
Promise<String> greeting = Async.function(child::composeGreeting, "Hello", name);
// ...
greeting.get()
```

To execute an untyped Child Workflow asynchronously, call `executeAsync` on the `ChildWorkflowStub`, as shown in the following example.

```java
//...
ChildWorkflowStub childUntyped =
    Workflow.newUntypedChildWorkflowStub(
        "GreetingChild", // your workflow type
        ChildWorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setWorkflowId("childWorkflow").build());

Promise<String> greeting =
    childUntyped.executeAsync(String.class, String.class, "Hello", name);
String result = greeting.get();
//...
```

The following examples show how to spawn a Child Workflow:

- Spawn a Child Workflow from a Workflow:

  ```java
  // Child Workflow interface
  @WorkflowInterface
  public interface GreetingChild {
  @WorkflowMethod
  String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name);
  }
  // Child Workflow implementation not shown

  // Parent Workflow implementation
  public class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {

  @Override
  public String getGreeting(String name) {
      GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);

      // This is a blocking call that returns only after child has completed.
      return child.composeGreeting("Hello", name );
  }
  }
  ```

- Spawn two Child Workflows (with the same type) in parallel:

  ```java
  // Parent Workflow implementation
  public class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {

      @Override
      public String getGreeting(String name) {

          // Workflows are stateful, so a new stub must be created for each new child.
          GreetingChild child1 = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);
          Promise<String> greeting1 = Async.function(child1::composeGreeting, "Hello", name);

          // Both children will run concurrently.
          GreetingChild child2 = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);
          Promise<String> greeting2 = Async.function(child2::composeGreeting, "Bye", name);

          // Do something else here.
          ...
          return "First: " + greeting1.get() + ", second: " + greeting2.get();
      }
  }
  ```

- Send a Signal to a Child Workflow from the parent:

  ```java
  // Child Workflow interface
  @WorkflowInterface
  public interface GreetingChild {
      @WorkflowMethod
      String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name);

      @SignalMethod
      void updateName(String name);
  }

  // Parent Workflow implementation
  public class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {

      @Override
      public String getGreeting(String name) {
          GreetingChild child = Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub(GreetingChild.class);
          Promise<String> greeting = Async.function(child::composeGreeting, "Hello", name);
          child.updateName("Temporal");
          return greeting.get();
      }
  }
  ```

- Sending a Query to Child Workflows from within the parent Workflow code is not supported. However, you can send a Query to Child Workflows from Activities using `WorkflowClient`.
