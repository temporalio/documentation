:::note

It is never possible for a new Workflow Execution to spawn with the same Workflow Id as another Open Workflow Execution.
An attempt to spawn a Workflow Execution with a Workflow Id that is the same as the Id of a currently Open Workflow Execution results in a "Workflow execution already started" error.
