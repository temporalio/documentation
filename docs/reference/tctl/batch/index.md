The `tctl batch` commands enable batch jobs. A batch job can signal, cancel, or terminate [Workflow Executions](/docs/content/what-is-a-workflow-execution).

Terminating a batch job does not roll back the operation performed by the batch job. However, you can use `tctl workflow reset` to roll back Workflow Executions.
