# Worker/SDK Metrics

The Temporal SDKs emit a largely common set of metrics. Note that all the below metrics are prefixed
with `temporal_` before being exported to their configured destination(s). The `Core` SDK type
includes all SDKs based on it, which as of now is only the Typescript SDK.

### Keys

The metrics always have some keys/labels attached to them. Their definitions:

- `task-queue` - Task queue the worker polls on
- `namespace` - Namespace the worker is bound to
- `poller_type` - One of `workflow_task`, `activity_task`, or `sticky_workflow_task`
- `worker_type` - One of `ActivityWorker`, `WorkflowWorker`, or `LocalActivityWorker` (Go only)
- `activity_type` - The function name / class name / etc of the activity the metric is associated with
- `workflow_type` - The function name / class name / etc of the workflow the metric is associated with
- `operation` - Only for client gRPC requests, is the name of the RPC method

### Metrics definitions

Note that `Core` includes the Typescript SDK.

#### Code definitions

If you're curious about how the metrics are defined in source, see:

- Core - [Worker metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/blob/master/core/src/telemetry/metrics.rs) and [Service Client metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/blob/master/client/src/metrics.rs)
- Java - [Worker metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/worker/MetricsType.java) and [Service Client metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-serviceclient/src/main/java/io/temporal/serviceclient/MetricsType.java)
- Go - [Worker & Service Client metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/c32b04729cc7691f80c16f80eed7f323ee5ce24f/internal/common/metrics/constants.go)

### Notes on differences between SDKs

- Histograms may have different buckets in different languages.
- Some labels may not apply in every SDK
