This guide provides an overview of data handling using a Data Converter on the Temporal Platform.

A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Cluster.
It is used by the Temporal SDK framework to serialize/deserialize data such as input and output of Activities and Workflows that need to be sent over the wire to the Temporal Cluster.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Data Converter encodes and decodes data</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/default-data-converter.svg" alt="Data Converter encodes and decodes data" height="1240" width="2300" /></div></div>

The Data Converter encodes data from your application before it is sent to the Temporal Cluster in the Client call.
When the Temporal Server sends the encoded data back to the Worker, the Data Converter decodes the data for processing within your application.
This technique ensures that all your sensitive data exists in its original format only on hosts that you control.

The main pieces of data that run through the Data Converter are arguments and return values:

- The Client:
  - Encodes Workflow, Signal, and Query arguments.
  - Decodes Workflow and Query return values.
- The Worker:
  - Decodes Workflow, Signal, and Query arguments.
  - Encodes Workflow and Query return values.
  - Decodes and encodes Activity arguments and return values.

Each piece of data (like a single argument or return value) is encoded as a [Payload](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.common.v1.Payload) Protobuf message, which consists of binary data and key-value metadata.

See API reference for details:

- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#DataConverter)
- [Java](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html)
- [Python](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.converter.DataConverter.html)
- [TypeScript](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.DataConverter)

## Default Data Converter

Each Temporal SDK includes and uses a default Data Converter.
The default Data Converter converts objects to bytes using a series of Payload Converters and supports binary, Protobufs, and JSON formats.
It encodes values in the following order:

- Null
- Byte array
- Protobuf JSON
- JSON

In SDKs that cannot determine parameter types at runtime (for example, TypeScript), Protobufs aren't included in the default converter.

For example:

- If a value is an instance of a Protobuf message, it is encoded with [proto3 JSON](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
- If a value isn't null, binary, or a Protobuf, it is encoded as JSON.
  If any part of it is not serializable as JSON <!--(for example, a Date—see JSON data types)--> an error is thrown.

## Custom Data Converter

A custom Data Converter extends the default <a class="tdlp" href="#">Data Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering, stored on, and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> with custom logic for payload conversion or payload encoding.

You can create a custom Data Converter to alter formats (for example, using [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) instead of JSON) or add compression and encryption.

You can customize the default Data Converter behavior in two ways:

- A Payload Converter serializes data, converting objects to bytes and back.
  To convert custom objects or data types to payloads and back, use a custom `PayloadConverter` and set it on a Data Converter.
- A Payload Codec encodes and decodes data, with bytes-to-bytes conversion.
  To use custom encryption and/or compression logic, create a custom `PayloadCodec` with your encryption/compression logic in the `encode` function, and your decryption/decompression logic in your `decode` function.

Custom Data Converters are not applied to all data; for example, Search Attributes are simple values and persisted unencoded so they can be indexed for searching.

<!--
Commenting this bit for reference later; the Headers detail might change.
- Search Attributes are simple values and are persisted unencoded so they can be indexed for searching.
- Headers are not encoded by the SDK. (The one exception—when implemented—will be the SDK [running OTel baggage through custom codecs](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/514).) -->

A customized Data Converter can have the following three components:

## Payload Converter

A Payload Converter serializes data, converting values to bytes and back.

When you request a Workflow Execution through your Client and pass a data input, the input is serialized using a Data Converter that runs it through a set of Payload Converters.
When your Workflow Execution starts, this data input is deserialized and passed as input to your Workflow.

See the API reference for more information.

- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.20.0/converter#PayloadConverter)
- [Java](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/PayloadConverter.html)
- [Python](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.converter.PayloadConverter.html)
- [TypeScript](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.PayloadConverter)

#### Custom payload conversion

If you use custom objects or types that are not supported by the Payload Converters provided in the SDKs, you can create a custom Payload Converter and use it with a Data Converter to run the specific conversions.

You can set multiple custom Payload Converters to run your conversions.
However, the order in which encoding Payload Converters are applied is important because during serialization, each encoding Payload Converter is tried in sequence until one properly serializes the value.

See <a class="tdlp" href="/application-development/features#custom-payload-conversion">Custom Payload Conversion<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to use custom payload conversion</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Create your custom `PayloadConverter` and set it on a `DataConverter` in your Client options.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/application-development/features#custom-payload-conversion">Learn more</a></span></span></a> for details on how to use the Payload Converter for custom data types.

## Failure Converter

A Failure Converter converts error objects to proto Failures and back.
The default Failure Converter copies error messages and stack traces as plain text.

See the API reference for details.

- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.21.0/converter#FailureConverter)
- [Java](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/failure/FailureConverter.html)
- [Python](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.converter.FailureConverter.html)
- [TypeScript](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.FailureConverter)

You can make a custom Failure Converter, but if you use multiple SDKs, you must implement the same logic in each.
Creating a custom Failure Converter is not yet supported in Java.

If your errors might contain sensitive information, you can encrypt the message and stack trace by configuring the default Failure Converter to use your encoded attributes, in which case it moves your `message` and `stack_trace` fields to a payload that's run through your codec.

## Payload Codec

A Payload Codec transforms an array of Payloads (for example, a list of Workflow arguments) into another array of Payloads.

The Payload Codec is an optional step that happens between the wire and the Payload Converter:

```bash
User code <--> Payload Converter <--> Payload Codec <--> Wire <--> Temporal Server
```

When serializing to Payloads, the Payload Converter is applied first to convert your objects to bytes, followed by codecs convert bytes to bytes.
When deserializing from Payloads, codecs are applied first to last to reverse the effect, followed by the Payload Converter.

See the API reference for details.

- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#PayloadCodec)
- [Java](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/payload/codec/PayloadCodec.html)
- [Python](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.converter.PayloadCodec.html)
- [TypeScript](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.PayloadCodec)

Use a custom Payload Codec to transform your payloads, for example implementing compression and/or encryption on your Workflow Execution data.

#### Encryption

Using end-to-end encryption in your custom Data Converter ensures that sensitive application data is secure when handled by the Temporal Server.

Apply your encryption logic in a custom Payload Codec and use it locally to encrypt data.
You maintain all the encryption keys, and the Temporal Server sees only encrypted data.
Your data exists unencrypted only on the Client and the Worker process that is executing the Workflows and Activities, on hosts that you control.

See [Data encryption](/production-readiness/develop#data-encryption) for details.

The following samples use encryption (AES GCM with 256-bit key) in a custom Data Converter:

- [Go sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/encryption)
- [Java sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/main/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/encryptedpayloads)
- [Python sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/tree/main/encryption)
- [TypeScript sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/encryption)

## Remote data encoding

Remote data encoding is exposing your Payload Codec via HTTP to support remote encoding and decoding.

Running your encoding remotely allows you to use it with `tctl` to encode/decode data for several commands including `tctl workflow start` and with Temporal Web UI to encode and decode data in your Workflow Execution details view.

To run data encoding/decoding remotely, use a <a class="tdlp" href="#codec-server">Codec Server<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Codec Server?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Codec Server is an HTTP server that is configured to use your custom Payload Codec to run encoding and decoding on your data remotely through endpoints.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#codec-server">Learn more</a></span></span></a>. A Codec Server is an HTTP server that is configured to use your custom Payload Codec.

<!-- Note that currently only Go and Java SDKs support setting a remote Payload Codec with a custom Data Converter.
You can however create a Codec Server in any of the SDKs, and use it to decode payloads on the Web UI and in `tctl`.-->

Before you use a remote data encoder to encode/decode your data, ensure that you consider all the security implications of running codecs remotely. For example, codecs that perform encryption may need to be secured to prevent decryption by untrusted callers.

#### Encoding data on the Web UI and tctl

You can perform some operations on your Workflow Execution using tctl and the Web UI, such as starting or sending a Signal to an active Workflow Execution using tctl or canceling a Workflow Execution from the Web UI, which might require inputs that contain sensitive data.

To encode this data, specify your Codec Server endpoints with the tctl command and configure your Web UI to use the Codec Server endpoints.

#### Decoding data on the Web UI and tctl

If you use custom encoding in your custom Data Converter, all the data handled by the Temporal Cluster is encoded. Since the Web UI uses the <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#">Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Visibility?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> database to show events and data stored on the Temporal Server, all data in the Workflow Execution History in your Web UI or tctl shows in the encoded format.

To see the original format of data in your Web UI and tctl, create a <a class="tdlp" href="#codec-server">Codec Server<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Codec Server?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Codec Server is an HTTP server that is configured to use your custom Payload Codec to run encoding and decoding on your data remotely through endpoints.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#codec-server">Learn more</a></span></span></a> with a remote data encoder and use the Payload Codec to decode your data locally.

Note that a remote data encoder is a separate system with access to your encryption keys and exposes APIs to encode and decode any data with the Payload Codec used. Evaluate and ensure that your remote data encoder endpoints are secured and only authorized users have access to them.

## Codec Server

A Codec Server is an HTTP server that is configured to use your custom <a class="tdlp" href="#payload-codec">Payload Codec<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering, stored on, and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#payload-codec">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to run encoding and decoding on your data remotely through endpoints.

![](/img/tctl-diagram-codec-server.svg)

You can create a custom <a class="tdlp" href="//production-readiness/develop#data-encryption">Payload Codec<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to encrypt data using a custom Data Converter</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Configure your custom encryption logic with `PayloadCodec` and set it with a custom Data Converter.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="//production-readiness/develop#data-encryption">Learn more</a></span></span></a> with your encoding logic (such as encryption and/or compression), and apply it to the data processed in your Workflows.

Using a custom Payload Codec in your Codec Server enables encoding and decoding data remotely through the endpoints that you expose on the Codec Server.

A Codec Server follows the Temporal [Codec Server Protocol](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server#codec-server-protocol).
It implements two endpoints:

- `POST /encode`
- `POST /decode`

Each endpoint receives and responds with a JSON body that has a `payloads` property with an array of Payloads.
The endpoints run the Payloads through a <a class="tdlp" href="#payload-codec">Payload Codec<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering, stored on, and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#payload-codec">Learn more</a></span></span></a> before returning them.

Most SDKs provide example Codec Server implementation samples, listed here:

- [Go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server)
- [Java](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/tree/master/temporal-remote-data-encoder)
- [Python](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/blob/main/encryption/codec_server.py)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/encryption/src/codec-server.ts)

#### Usage

When using tctl or the Web UI to perform some operations on a Workflow Execution, you can configure the exposed Codec Server endpoints to remotely encode data sent to the Temporal Server and decode data received from the Temporal Server.

When you apply custom encoding with encryption or compression on your Workflow data, it is stored in the encrypted/compressed format on the Temporal Server.

For example, the following objects are persisted in your encoded format in the Workflow Execution Event History:

- Inputs and outputs/results in your <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Workflow<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution.

### Setting Codec Server endpoints

To use a <a class="tdlp" href="#codec-server">Codec Server<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Codec Server?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Codec Server is an HTTP server that is configured to use your custom Payload Codec to run encoding and decoding on your data remotely through endpoints.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#codec-server">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, first run it with your Payload Codec and then configure [tctl](/tctl-v1) and the [Web UI](/web-ui) to use it.

#### tctl

Once the Codec Server is started, provide the exposed endpoint to tctl using the `--codec_endpoint` global option.

For example, if you are running your Codec Server locally and expose port 8888 as your endpoint, you can run the following command to see the decoded output of "yourWorkflow" Workflow Execution in the Namespace "yourNamespace".

```bash
tctl --codec-endpoint "http://localhost:8888" --namespace "yourNamespace" workflow show --workflow-id "yourWorkflow"  --run-id "<yourRunId>" --output "table"
```

#### Web UI

You can set the codec endpoints either in the Web UI or in the Web UI server configuration file before starting the Web UI server.

**In the Web UI**

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Data Encoder icon</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/img/docs/data-encoder-button.png" alt="Data Encoder icon" height="304" width="406" /></div></div>

Select the icon with an up-down arrow on the bottom left of the screen.
This action displays the codec endpoint dialog.

Enter the URL and port number for your codec endpoint.
Refresh your Workflow Execution page to see encoded/decoded data.

**In the Web UI server configuration file**

Specify the codec endpoint in the Web UI server [configuration file](/references/web-ui-configuration#codec):

```yaml
codec:
    endpoint: {{ default .Env.TEMPORAL_CODEC_ENDPOINT "{namespace}"}}
```

Start the Web UI server to use this endpoint for decoding data in Workflow Executions in the specified Namespace.
