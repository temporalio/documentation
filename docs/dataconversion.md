This guide provides an overview of data handling using a Data Converter on the Temporal Platform.

A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering, stored on, and exiting a Temporal Cluster.
It is used by the Temporal SDK framework to serialize/deserialize input and output of Activities and Workflows that need to be sent over the wire to the Temporal Cluster.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Data Converter encodes and decodes data</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/default-data-converter.svg" alt="Data Converter encodes and decodes data" height="1240" width="2300" /></div></div>

The Data Converter encodes all data from your application before it is sent to the Temporal Cluster in the Client call. When the Temporal Server sends the encoded data back to the Worker, the Data Converter decodes the data for processing within your application. This ensures that all your sensitive data exists in its original format only on hosts that you control.

The main pieces of data that run through the Data Converter are arguments and return values:

- The Client:
  - Encodes Workflow, Signal, and Query arguments.
  - Decodes Workflow and Query return values.
- The Worker:
  - Decodes Workflow, Signal, and Query arguments.
  - Encodes Workflow and Query return values.
  - Decodes and encodes Activity arguments and return values.

Each piece of data (like a single argument or return value) is encoded as a [Payload](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.common.v1.Payload) Protobuf message, which consists of binary data and key-value metadata.

## Default Data Converter

Each Temporal SDK includes and uses a default Data Converter.
The default Data Converter converts objects to bytes using a series of Payload Converters.
In most SDKs, the default converter supports binary, Protobufs, and JSON and encodes values in the following order:

- Null
- Binary
- Protobuf JSON
- JSON

In SDKs that cannot determine parameter types at runtime (for example, TypeScript) Protobufs aren't included in the default converter.

For example:

- If a value is an instance of a Protobuf message, it will be encoded with [proto3 JSON](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
- If a value isn't null, binary, or a Protobuf, it will be encoded as JSON. If any part of it is not serializable as JSON (for example, a Date—see JSON data types), an error will be thrown.

The default converter also supports decoding binary Protobufs.

## Custom Data Converter

A custom Data Converter uses custom logic for payload conversion or payload encryption to customize the default <a class="tdlp" href="/security#data-converter">Data Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering, stored on, and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#data-converter">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

You can create a custom Data Converter to alter formats (for example using [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) instead of JSON) or add compression and encryption.

You can customize the default Data Converter behavior in two ways:

- A Payload Converter serializes data, converting objects to bytes and back. To convert custom objects or data types to payloads and back, use a custom `PayloadConverter` and set it to alter the default Data Converter.
- A Payload Codec encodes and decodes data, with bytes to bytes conversion. To use custom encryption and/or compression logic, create a custom `PayloadCodec` with your encryption/compression logic in the `encode` function, and your decryption/decompression logic in your `decode` function.

Custom Data Converters are not applied to all data:

- Search Attributes are simple values and are persisted unencoded.
- Headers are not encoded by the SDK (the one exception will be—when implemented—the SDK [running OTel baggage through custom Codecs](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/514)).

A customized Data Converter can have the following three components:

## Payload Converter

A Payload Converter serializes data, converting objects or values to bytes and back.

When you request a Workflow Execution through your Client and pass a data input, the input is deserialized using the default Data Converter that runs it through a set of Payload Converters.
When your Workflow Execution starts, this data input is serialized and passed as input to your Workflow.

Some SDKs have a Payload Converter as a part of the Data Converter, that does the conversion from a value to a bytes and back.
See the API reference for more information.

- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.20.0/converter#PayloadConverter)
- [Java](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/PayloadConverter.html)
- [TypeScript](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.DefaultPayloadConverter#converters)
- [Python](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.converter.PayloadConverter.html)

#### Custom Payload Conversion

If you use custom objects or types that are not supported by the Payload Converters provided in the SDKs, you can create a custom Payload Converter and use it with the default Data Converter to run the specific conversions.

You can set multiple custom Payload Converters to run your conversions. However, the order in which encoding payload converters are applied is important because during serialization, each encoding Payload Converter is tried in order until one properly serializes the value.

See <a class="tdlp" href="/application-development/features#custom-payload-conversion">Custom Payload Conversion<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to use custom payload-conversion</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Define your custom `PayloadConverter` with your custom logic and set the `DefaultDataConverter` with your custom `PayloadConverter` in your Client options.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/application-development/features#custom-payload-conversion">Learn more</a></span></span></a> for details on how to use the Payload Converter for custom data types.

## Failure Converter

A Failure Converter converts error objects to proto Failures and back.
The default Failure Converter copies error messages and stack traces as plain text. See the API reference for details.

- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.21.0/converter#FailureConverter)
- [Java](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/failure/FailureConverter.html)
- [TypeScript](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.FailureConverter)
- [Python](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.converter.FailureConverter.html)

You can make a custom Failure Converter, but if you use multiple SDKs, you will have to implement the same logic in each.
Custom/customizable failure converter is not yet supported in Java.

If your errors may contain sensitive information, you can encrypt the message and stack trace by configuring the default Failure Converter to use your Payload Codec, in which case it will move your `message` and `stack_trace` fields to a payload that's run through your codec.

## Payload Codec

A Payload Codec transforms an array of Payloads (for example, a list of Workflow arguments) into another array of Payloads.

The Payload Codec is an optional step that happens between the wire and the Payload Converter:

```bash
User code <--> Payload Converter <--> Payload Codec <--> Wire <--> Temporal Server
```

A Payload Codec encodes and decodes data. When serializing to Payloads, the Payload Converter is applied first to convert your objects to bytes, followed by codecs. The codecs are applied last to first, which means that the earlier encoders wrap the later ones.

When deserializing from Payloads, codecs are applied first to last to reverse the effect, followed by the Data Converter.

Use a custom Payload Codec to transform your payloads, for example by implementing compression and/or encryption and decryption.

#### Encryption​ and Decryption

Using end-to-end encryption in your custom Data Converter ensures that all your sensitive application data is secure when handled by the Temporal Server.
You can apply your encryption logic in a custom Payload Codec and use it locally to encrypt data.
You maintain all the encryption keys, and the Temporal Server sees only encrypted data.
Your data exists unencrypted only on the Client and the Worker process that is executing the Workflows and Activities, on hosts that you control.

See [Data encryption](/production-readiness/develop#data-encryption) for details.

The following samples use encryption (AES GCM with 256-bit key) in a custom Data Converter:

- [Go sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/encryption)
- [Java sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/main/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/encryptedpayloads)
- [TypeScript sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/encryption)
- [Python sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/tree/main/encryption)

## Remote data encoding

Remote data encoding is using your custom Data Converter to decode (and encode) your payloads remotely through endpoints.

Running your encoding remotely allows you to use it with `tctl` to encode payloads for `tctl workflow start` and with Temporal WebUI to [decode encrypted payloads](#decoding-payloads-on-the-web-ui-and-tctl)

To run data encoding/decoding remotely, use a <a class="tdlp" href="/security#codec-server">Codec Server<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Codec Server?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Codec Server is an HTTP server that runs data from tctl or the Web UI through a Payload Codec.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#codec-server">Learn more</a></span></span></a>. A Codec Server is an HTTP server that is configured to use your custom Payload Codec with encryption/compression and decryption/decompression logic.

Note that currently only Go and Java SDKs support setting a remote Payload Codec with a custom Data Converter.
You can however create a Codec Server in any of the SDKs, and use it to decode payloads on the WebUI and in `tctl`.

Before you use a remote data encoder to encode your payloads and allowing decryption or decoding through a service call, ensure that you consider all the security implications of running encryptions remotely.

#### Decoding payloads on the Web UI and tctl

If you use custom encryption/encoding with your custom Data Converter, all the data handled by the Temporal Cluster is encrypted/encoded. Since the WebUI uses the <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#">Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Visibility?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> database to show events and data stored on the Temporal Server, all data in the Workflow Execution History in your WebUI or tctl is encoded/encrypted.

To see the original format of data in your WebUI and tctl, create a <a class="tdlp" href="/security#codec-server">Codec Server<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Codec Server?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Codec Server is an HTTP server that runs data from tctl or the Web UI through a Payload Codec.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#codec-server">Learn more</a></span></span></a> with a remote data encoder and use the Payload Codec to decode your data locally.

Note that an encryption/decryption remote data encoder is a separate system with access to your encryption keys and exposes APIs to encode and decode any payloads that are encrypted with the Payload Codec used. Evaluate and ensure that your remote data encoder endpoints are secured and only authorized users have access to them.

## Codec Server

A Codec Server is an HTTP server that runs data from [tctl](/tctl-v1) or the [Web UI](/web-ui) through a <a class="tdlp" href="/security#payload-codec">Payload Codec<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering, stored on, and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#payload-codec">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- <a class="tdlp" href="/security#codec-server">How to set up a Codec Server<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to set up a Codec Server</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Run a Codec Server with your Payload Codec and then configure tctl and the Web UI to use the server.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#codec-server">Learn more</a></span></span></a>

By default, tctl and the Web UI use the <a class="tdlp" href="/security#default-data-converter">Default Data Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering, stored on, and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#default-data-converter">Learn more</a></span></span></a> without a <a class="tdlp" href="/security#payload-codec">Payload Codec<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering, stored on, and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#payload-codec">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
If you use a Payload Codec with your SDK, you may not be able to understand the Payload data displayed in the Web UI/tctl (for example, it may be encrypted or compressed).
In order to convert the data to its original format, you can configure the Web UI/tctl to use a Codec Server that uses your Payload Codec.

![](/img/tctl-diagram-codec-server.svg)

## Use case: tctl

Suppose that you want to view Workflow History.
This information needs to be decoded before it can be viewed.

You can use [tctl workflow showid](/tctl-v1/workflow#show) to view a Workflow Execution Event History.

```bash
tctl workflow showid <workflowID>
```

With a Codec Server, Payloads that are part of the Event History will be sent to the Codec Server to be decoded before being deserialized by the Default Data Converter and displayed in your terminal.

- <a class="tdlp" href="/security#configure-tctl">How to configure tctl with a Codec Server<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to set up a Codec Server</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Run a Codec Server with your Payload Codec and then configure tctl and the Web UI to use the server.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#configure-tctl">Learn more</a></span></span></a>

## Use case: Web UI

Workflow Execution Event History is available in the Web UI.
Payload information for each Event is captured within Event 'input' and 'result' fields.
Without a Codec Server, this information remains encoded.

Passing these Payloads through a Codec Server returns decoded results to the Web UI.

### Codec Server

To use a <a class="tdlp" href="/security#codec-server">Codec Server<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Codec Server?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Codec Server is an HTTP server that runs data from tctl or the Web UI through a Payload Codec.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#codec-server">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, first run it with your Payload Codec and then configure [tctl](/tctl-v1) and the [Web UI](/web-ui) to use it.

### Run the server

A Codec Server is an HTTP server that follows the Temporal [Codec Server Protocol](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server#codec-server-protocol).
It implements two endpoints:

- `POST /encode`
- `POST /decode`

Each endpoint receives and responds with a JSON body that has a `payloads` property with an array of Payloads.
The endpoints run the Payloads through a <a class="tdlp" href="/security#payload-codec">Payload Codec<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering, stored on, and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#payload-codec">Learn more</a></span></span></a> before returning them.

Sample Codec Servers:

- [Go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/codec-server)
- [Java](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/tree/master/temporal-remote-data-encoder)
- [Python](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/blob/main/encryption/codec_server.py)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/encryption/src/codec-server.ts)

### Configure tctl

Once the Codec Server is started, for example on `http://localhost:8888`, provide it to tctl using the `--codec_endpoint` global option:

```bash
tctl --codec_endpoint 'http://localhost:8888' workflow show --wid workflow-id-123
```

### Configure the Web UI

Once the Codec Server is started, there are two ways to provide it to the Web UI:

#### In the UI

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Data Encoder icon</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/img/docs/data-encoder-button.png" alt="Data Encoder icon" height="304" width="406" /></div></div>

Select the icon with an up-down arrow on the bottom left of the screen.
This action displays the codec endpoint dialog.

Enter the URL and port number for your codec endpoint.
Exit the dialog, go back to the previous page, and refresh the page.

The button should now be light blue, and your Payloads should be displayed in a readable format.

#### In the config file

The codec endpoint can be specified in the [configuration file](/references/web-ui-configuration#codec):

```yaml
codec:
    endpoint: {{ default .Env.TEMPORAL_CODEC_ENDPOINT "{namespace}"}}
```
