To follow the Java SDK tutorials we recommend that you have the following environments set up.

## Java JDK

Make sure you have the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed. These tutorials were produced using Java SE 14.0.1.

## IntelliJ IDEA

Download and install the [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). The IDE automates much of the project setup for you. It comes packaged with Gradle, a dependency management and build tool which we you will use for these tutorials.

## Temporal server

Download, install, and run the [Temporal server](/docs/install-temporal-server) via docker-compose. It is easy to do and you can keep it running in the background while you build applications.

## Tutorial directory

Create a place where you can group the Temporal Java tutorials. Creating a "temporal-java-tutorials" directory in the location of your choice:

```bash
mkdir temporal-java-tutorials
```
