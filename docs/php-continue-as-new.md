Workflows that need to rerun periodically could naively be implemented as a big **while** loop with
a sleep where the entire logic of the Workflow is inside the body of the **while** loop. The problem
with this approach is that the history for that Workflow will keep growing to a point where it
reaches the maximum size enforced by the service.

**ContinueAsNew** is the low level construct that enables implementing such Workflows without the
risk of failures down the road. The operation atomically completes the current execution and starts
a new execution of the Workflow with the same **Workflow Id**. The new execution will not carry
over any history from the old execution.

To trigger this behavior, use `Workflow::continueAsNew` or `Workflow::newContinueAsNewStub` method:

```php
#[Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
public function periodic(string $name, int $value = 0)
{
    for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++) {
        // do something
        $value++;
    }
    
    // maintain $value counter between runs
    return Workflow::newContinueAsNewStub(self::class)->periodic($name, $value);
}
```
