To follow the Go SDK tutorials we recommend that you have the following environments set up.

## Go

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed. These tutorials were produced using Go 1.14.

## Temporal server

Download, install, and run the Temporal server via `docker-compose`. You can [find Temporal server setup instructions](/docs/install-temporal-server) here. You should keep it running in the background while you build applications.
