To follow the Go SDK tutorials we recommend that you have the following environments set up.

## Go

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed. These tutorials were produced using Go 1.14.

## Temporal server

Download, install, and run the Temporal server via `docker-compose`. You can find Temporal server setup instructions here: [https://docs.temporal.io/docs/server-quick-install](/docs/server-quick-install). It is easy to do and you can keep it running in the background while you build applications.
