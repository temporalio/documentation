### Scenario-based samples

- [**File Processing Sample**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/fileprocessing): Demonstrates how to route tasks to specific Workers. This sample has a set of Activities that download a file, processes it, and uploads the result to a destination. Any Worker can execute the first Activity. However, the second and third Activities must be executed on the same host as the first one.

- [**Booking SAGA**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/bookingsaga): Demonstrates Temporals take on the Camunda BPMN "trip booking" example.

- [**Money Transfer**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/moneytransfer): Demonstrates the use of a dedicated Activity Worker.

- [**Money Batch**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/moneybatch): Demonstrates a situation where a single deposit should be initiated for multiple withdrawals. For example, a seller might want to be paid once per fixed number of transactions. This sample can be easily extended to perform a payment based on more complex criteria, such as at a specific time or an accumulated amount. The sample also demonstrates how to Signal the Workflow when it executes (*Signal with start*). If the Workflow is already executing, it just receives the Signal. If it is not executing, then the Workflow executes first, and then the Signal is delivered to it. *Signal with start* is a "lazy" way to execute Workflows when Signaling them.

- [**Customer Application Approval DSL**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/dsl): Demonstrates execution of a customer application approval workflow defined in a DSL (like JSON or YAML)

- [**Workflow Interceptor**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/interceptor): Demonstrates how to create and register a simple Workflow Interceptor.

- [**List Workflows**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/listworkflows): Demonstrates the use of custom search attributes and ListWorkflowExecutionsRequest with custom queries.

- [**Terminate Workflow**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/terminateworkflow): Demonstrates how to terminate a workflow using client API.

- [**Get Workflow Results Async**](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/master/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/getresultsasync): Demonstrates how to start and get workflow results in async manner.
