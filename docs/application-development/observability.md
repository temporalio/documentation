This section provides documentation on how to observe your Temporal application.

This section covers features related to measuring the state of the application, including:

- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [Tracing](#tracing)
- [Logging](#logging)
- [Visibility](#visibility)
- [Replays](#replays)

## Metrics

Each Temporal SDK is capable of emitting an optional set of metrics from either the Client or the Worker process.
For a complete list of metrics capable of being emitted, see the [SDK metrics reference](/references/sdk-metrics).

Metrics can be scraped and stored in time series databases, such as:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
- [M3db](https://m3db.io/docs/)
- [statsd](https://github.com/statsd/statsd)

Temporal also provides a dashboard you can integrate with graphing services like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/). For more information, see:

- Temporal's implementation of the [Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards)
- [How to export metrics in Grafana](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts#exploring-metrics-via-grafana)

To emit metrics from the Temporal Client in Go, create a [metrics handler](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal/common/metrics#Handler) from the [Client Options](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ClientOptions) and specify a listener address to be used by Prometheus.

```go
client.Options{
		MetricsHandler: sdktally.NewMetricsHandler(newPrometheusScope(prometheus.Configuration{
			ListenAddress: "0.0.0.0:9090",
			TimerType:     "histogram",
		}
```

The Go SDK currently supports the [Tally](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/tally) library; however, Tally offers [extensible custom metrics reporting](https://github.com/uber-go/tally#report-your-metrics), which is exposed through the [`WithCustomMetricsReporter`](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/server/options/#withcustommetricsreporter) API.

For more information, see the [Go sample for metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/metrics).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

To emit metrics in Java, you should use the following steps:

- Set the scope
- Set the scrape end point
- Initialize the Workflow service stub
- Add metrics scope in the Workflow service stubs options
- Initialize the Client

In addition to the `client workflow workflowservicestubs workflowservicestubsoptions` options, set the following:

```java
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;
import com.uber.m3.tally.RootScopeBuilder;
import com.uber.m3.tally.Scope;
import com.uber.m3.util.ImmutableMap;
import io.micrometer.prometheus.PrometheusConfig;
import io.micrometer.prometheus.PrometheusMeterRegistry;
import io.temporal.common.reporter.MicrometerClientStatsReporter;
```

The following code example demonstrates how to emit metrics from your Workflow.

```java
// task queue to be used for this sample
  public static final String DEFAULT_TASK_QUEUE_NAME = "metricsqueue";

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    PrometheusMeterRegistry registry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry(PrometheusConfig.DEFAULT);
```

Set your scope.
In this example, the scope will report once a second.

```java
Scope scope =
        new RootScopeBuilder()
            .reporter(new MicrometerClientStatsReporter(registry))
            .reportEvery(com.uber.m3.util.Duration.ofSeconds(1));
```

Next, set an endpoint to allow Prometheus to scrape metrics from. In this example, the endpoint is set to a http server at `8080`.

```java
HttpServer scrapeEndpoint = MetricsUtils.startPrometheusScrapeEndpoint(registry, 8080);
```

Stopping the Worker will stop the http server that exposes the scrape endpoint.

```java
    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> scrapeEndpoint.stop(1)));
```

Add the metrics scope to Workflow service stub options.

```java
 WorkflowServiceStubsOptions stubOptions =
        WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder().setMetricsScope(scope).build();
```

For more information, see the [Setting up SDK metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/main/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/metrics) in the Java Samples repository.

Workers can emit metrics and traces. There are a few [telemetry options](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.TelemetryOptions) that can be provided to [`Runtime.install`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.runtime/#install). The common options are:

- `metrics: { otel: { url } }`: The URL of a gRPC [OpenTelemetry collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).
- `metrics: { prometheus: { bindAddress } }`: Address on the Worker host that will have metrics for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to scrape.

To set up tracing of Workflows and Activities, use our [opentelemetry-interceptors](/typescript/logging#opentelemetry-tracing) package.

```typescript
  telemetryOptions: {
      metrics: {
        prometheus: { bindAddress: '0.0.0.0:9464' },
      },
      logging: { forward: { level: 'DEBUG' } },
    },

## Tracing

Tracing allows you to view the call graph of a Workflow along with its Activities and any child Workflows.

Temporal Web's tracing capabilities mainly track Activity Execution within a Temporal context. If you need custom tracing specific for your use case, you should make use of context propagation to add tracing logic accordingly.

For more information, see [Tracing Temporal Workflows with DataDog](https://spiralscout.com/blog/tracing-temporal-workflow-with-datadog).

<TabItem value="go">

The Go SDK provides support for distributed tracing through [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/).
Tracing allows you to view the call graph of a Workflow along with its Activities and any child Workflows.

Tracing can be configured by providing an [opentracing.Tracer](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go#Tracer)
implementation in [ClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions) during client instantiation.

For more details on how to configure and leverage tracing, see the [OpenTracing documentation](https://opentracing.io/docs/getting-started/).

The OpenTracing support has been validated using [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), but other implementations mentioned [here](https://opentracing.io/docs/supported-tracers/) should also work.

Tracing functionality utilizes generic context propagation provided by the Client.

The [`interceptors-opentelemetry`](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/interceptors-opentelemetry) sample shows how to use the SDK's built-in OpenTelemetry tracing to trace everything from starting a Workflow to Workflow Execution to running an Activity from that Workflow.

The built-in tracing uses protobuf message headers (like [this one](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/b2b8ae6592a8730dd5be6d90569d1aea84e1712f/temporal/api/workflowservice/v1/request_response.proto#L161) when starting a Workflow) to propagate the tracing information from the client to the Workflow and from the Workflow to its successors (when Continued As New), children, and Activities.
All of these executions are linked with a single trace identifier and have the proper `parent -> child` span relation.

Tracing is compatible between different Temporal SDKs as long as compatible [context propagators](https://opentelemetry.lightstep.com/core-concepts/context-propagation/) are used.

**Context propagation**

The TypeScript SDK uses the global OpenTelemetry propagator.

To extend the default ([Trace Context](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/packages/opentelemetry-core/README.md#w3ctracecontextpropagator-propagator) and [Baggage](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/packages/opentelemetry-core/README.md#baggage-propagator) propagators) to also include the [Jaeger propagator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger), follow these steps:

- `npm i @opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger`

- At the top level of your Workflow code, add the following lines:

  ```js
  import {propagation} from "@opentelemetry/api";
  import {
    CompositePropagator,
    W3CTraceContextPropagator,
    W3CBaggagePropagator,
  } from "@opentelemetry/core";
  import {JaegerPropagator} from "@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger";

  propagation.setGlobalPropagator(
    new CompositePropagator({
      propagators: [
        new W3CTraceContextPropagator(),
        new W3CBaggagePropagator(),
        new JaegerPropagator(),
      ],
    })
  );
  ```

Similarly, you can customize the OpenTelemetry `NodeSDK` propagators by following the instructions in the [Initialize the SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/experimental/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-node#initialize-the-sdk) section of the README.

## Logging

Send logs and errors to a logging service, so that when things go wrong, you can see what happened.

#### Custom logging

Use a custom logger for logging.

groupId="site-lang"

<TabItem value="go">

This field sets a custom Logger that is used for all logging actions of the instance of the Temporal Client.

Although the Go SDK does not support most third-party logging solutions natively, [our friends at Banzai Cloud](https://github.com/sagikazarmark) built the adapter package [logur](https://github.com/logur/logur) which makes it possible to use third party loggers with minimal overhead.
Most of the popular logging solutions have existing adapters in Logur, but you can find a full list [in the Logur Github project](https://github.com/logur?q=adapter-).

Here is an example of using Logur to support [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus):

```go
package main
import (
  "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"

	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
	logrusadapter "logur.dev/adapter/logrus"
	"logur.dev/logur"
)

func main() {
  // ...
  logger := logur.LoggerToKV(logrusadapter.New(logrus.New()))
  clientOptions := client.Options{
    Logger: logger,
  }
  temporalClient, err := client.NewClient(clientOptions)
  // ...
}
```

**Logging in Workers and Clients**

The Worker comes with a default logger which defaults to log any messages with level `INFO` and higher to `STDERR` using `console.error`.
The following [log levels](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/worker#loglevel) are listed in increasing order of severity.

**Customizing the default logger**

Temporal uses a [`DefaultLogger`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.defaultlogger/) that implements the basic interface:

```ts
import {Runtime, DefaultLogger} from "@temporalio/worker";

const logger = new DefaultLogger("WARN", ({level, message}) => {
  console.log(`Custom logger: ${level} — ${message}`);
});
Runtime.install({logger});
```

The previous code example sets the default logger to only log messages with level `WARN` and higher.

**Accumulate logs for testing and reporting**

```ts
import {DefaultLogger, LogEntry} from "@temporalio/worker";

const logs: LogEntry[] = [];
const logger = new DefaultLogger("TRACE", (entry) => logs.push(entry));
log.debug("hey", {a: 1});
log.info("ho");
log.warn("lets", {a: 1});
log.error("go");
```

A common logging use case is logging to a file to be picked up by a collector like the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/nodejs/?tab=winston30).

```ts
import {Runtime} from "@temporalio/worker";
import winston from "winston";

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: "info",
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [new transports.File({filename: "/path/to/worker.log"})],
});
Runtime.install({logger});
```

In Workflow Definitions you can use `workflow.GetLogger(ctx)` to write logs.

```go
import (
	"context"
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/activity"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

// Workflow is a standard workflow definition.
// Note that the Workflow and Activity don't need to care that
// their inputs/results are being compressed.
func Workflow(ctx workflow.Context, name string) (string, error) {
// ...

workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)

// Getting the logger from the context.
	logger := workflow.GetLogger(ctx)
// Logging a message with the key value pair `name` and `name`
	logger.Info("Compressed Payloads workflow started", "name", name)

	info := map[string]string{
		"name": name,
	}


	logger.Info("Compressed Payloads workflow completed.", "result", result)

	return result, nil
}
```

Logging from Workflows is tricky for two reasons:

1. Workflows run in a sandboxed environment and cannot do any I/O.
1. Workflow code might get replayed at any time, generating duplicate log messages.

To work around these limitations, we recommend using the Sinks feature in the TypeScript SDK.
Sinks enable one-way export of logs, metrics, and traces from the Workflow isolate to the Node.js environment.

<!--
Workflows in Temporal may be replayed from the beginning of their history when resumed. In order for Temporal to recreate the exact state Workflow code was in, the code is required to be fully deterministic. To prevent breaking [determinism](/typescript/determinism), in the TypeScript SDK, Workflow code runs in an isolated execution environment and may not use any of the Node.js APIs or communicate directly with the outside world. -->

Sinks are written as objects with methods. Similar to Activities, they are declared in the Worker and then proxied in Workflow code, and it helps to share types between both.

<details>
  <summary>Comparing Sinks, Activities and Interceptors</summary>
  
Sinks are similar to Activities in that they are both registered on the Worker and proxied into the Workflow.
However, they differ from Activities in important ways:

- Sink functions don't return any value back to the Workflow and cannot not be awaited.
- Sink calls are not recorded in Workflow histories (no timeouts or retries).
- Sink functions are _always_ run on the same Worker that runs the Workflow they are called from.

</details>

**Declaring the Sink Interface**

Explicitly declaring a Sink's interface is optional, but is useful for ensuring type safety in subsequent steps:

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-interface-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

**Implementing Sinks**

Implementing Sinks is a two-step process.

Implement and inject the Sink function into a Worker

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-worker-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

- Sink function implementations are passed as an object into [WorkerOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.workeroptions/#sinks)
- You can specify whether you want the injected function to be called during Workflow replay by setting the `callDuringReplay` boolean option.

**Proxy and call a Sink function from a Workflow**

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-workflow-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

Some important features of the [InjectedSinkFunction](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.InjectedSinkFunction) interface:

- **Injected WorkflowInfo argument**: The first argument of a Sink function implementation is a [`workflowInfo` object](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.workflowinfo/) that contains useful metadata.
- **Limited arguments types**: The remaining Sink function arguments are copied between the sandbox and the Node.js environment using the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm).
- **No return value**: To prevent breaking determinism, Sink functions cannot return values to the Workflow.

**Advanced: Performance considerations and non-blocking Sinks**

The injected sink function contributes to the overall Workflow Task processing duration.

- If you have a long-running sink function, such as one that tries to communicate with external services, you might start seeing Workflow Task timeouts.
- The effect is multiplied when using `callDuringReplay: true` and replaying long Workflow histories because the Workflow Task timer starts when the first history page is delivered to the Worker.

## Visibility

The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.

The typical method of retrieving a Workflow Execution is by its Workflow Id.

However, sometimes you'll want to retrieve one or more Workflow Executions based on another property. For example, imagine you want to get all Workflow Executions of a certain type that have failed within a time range, so that you can start new ones with the same arguments.

You can do this with [Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute/).

- [**Default** Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute/#default-search-attributes) like `WorkflowType`, `StartTime` and `ExecutionStatus` are automatically added to Workflow Executions.
- _Custom Search Attributes_ can contain their own domain-specific data (like `customerId` or `numItems`).
  - A few [generic Custom Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute/#custom-search-attributes) like `CustomKeywordField` and `CustomIntField` are created by default in Temporal's [Docker Compose](/clusters/quick-install/#docker-compose).

The steps to using Search Attributes are:

- Create a new Search Attribute in your Cluster [using `tctl`](/tctl/how-to-add-a-custom-search-attribute-to-a-cluster-using-tctl/).
- Set the value of the Search Attribute for a Workflow Execution:
  - On the Client by including it as an option when starting the Execution.
  - In the Workflow by calling `UpsertSearchAttributes`.
- Read the value of the Search Attribute:
  - On the Client by calling `DescribeWorkflow`.
  - In the Workflow by looking at `WorkflowInfo`.
- Query Workflow Executions by the Search Attribute using a [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter/):
  - [In `tctl`](/tctl/workflow/list/#--query).
  - In code by calling `ListWorkflowExecutions`.

- Type: `map[string]interface{}`
- Default: Empty.

These are the corresponding [Search Attribute value types](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute/#types) in Go:

- Keyword = string
- Int = int64
- Double = float64
- Bool = bool
- Datetime = time.Time
- Text = string

The following code starts a Workflow Execution with a Search Attribute of `CustomIntField` and `MiscData`.

```go
searchAttributes := map[string]interface{}{
  "CustomIntField": 1,
  "MiscData": "yellow",
}
workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
  SearchAttributes: searchAttributes,
  // ...
}

if err != nil {
  // ...

You can provide key-value pairs as Search Attributes in [StartWorkflowOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#StartWorkflowOptions).
In Go, Search Attributes are represented as `map[string]interface{}`.
The value provided in the map must be the same type that was added to a Cluster.

This can be useful for tagging executions with useful attributes you may want to search up later. For example:

```go
func (c *Client) CallMyWorkflow(ctx context.Context, workflowID string, payload map[string]interface{}) error {
    // ...
    searchAttributes := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomerId": payload["customer"],
        "MiscData": payload["miscData"]
    }
    options := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
        ID:                 workflowID,
        TaskQueue:          app.MyTaskQueue,
        SearchAttributes:   searchAttributes
    }
    we, err := c.Client.ExecuteWorkflow(ctx, options, app.MyWorkflow, payload)
    // ...
}

### Upsert custom search attributes

Upsert Search Attributes is used to add or update Search Attributes from within Workflow code.

<TabItem value="go">

In advanced cases, you may want to dynamically update these attributes as the Workflow progresses.
[UpsertSearchAttributes](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#UpsertSearchAttributes) is used to add or update Search Attributes from within Workflow code.

`UpsertSearchAttributes` will merge attributes to the existing map in the Workflow.
Consider this example Workflow code:

```go
func MyWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, input string) error {

    attr1 := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomIntField": 1,
        "CustomBoolField": true,
    }
    workflow.UpsertSearchAttributes(ctx, attr1)

    attr2 := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomIntField": 2,
        "CustomKeywordField": "seattle",
    }
    workflow.UpsertSearchAttributes(ctx, attr2)
}
```

After the second call to `UpsertSearchAttributes`, the map will contain:

```go
map[string]interface{}{
    "CustomIntField": 2, // last update wins
    "CustomBoolField": true,
    "CustomKeywordField": "seattle",
}
```

### Remove search attributes

To remove a Search Attribute that was previously set, set it to an empty array, `[]`.

<TabItem value="go">

**There is no support for removing a field.**

However, to achieve a similar effect, set the field to some placeholder value.
For example, you could set `CustomKeywordField` to `impossibleVal`.
Then searching `CustomKeywordField != 'impossibleVal'` will match Workflows with `CustomKeywordField` not equal to `impossibleVal`, which includes Workflows without the `CustomKeywordField` set.

## Replays

Replays recreate the exact state the Workflow code was in. You can replay Workflows from the beginning of their history when resumed.

Replays allow code to resume only if it is compatible from a deterministic point of view.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Python', value: 'python'},{label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

Use the [worker.WorflowReplayer](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#WorkflowReplayer) to replay an existing Workflow Execution from its Event History to replicate errors.

For example, the following code retrieves the Event History of a Workflow:

```go
import (
	"context"

	"go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1"
	"go.temporal.io/api/history/v1"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)

func GetWorkflowHistory(ctx context.Context, client client.Client, id, runID string) (*history.History, error) {
	var hist history.History
	iter := client.GetWorkflowHistory(ctx, id, runID, false, enums.HISTORY_EVENT_FILTER_TYPE_ALL_EVENT)
	for iter.HasNext() {
		event, err := iter.Next()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		hist.Events = append(hist.Events, event)
	}
	return &hist, nil
}
```

This history can then be used to _replay_.
For example, the following code creates a `WorkflowReplayer` and register the `MyWorkflow` Workflow function.
Then it calls the `ReplayWorkflowHistory` to _replay_ the Event History and return an error code.

```go
import (
	"context"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
)

func ReplayWorkflow(ctx context.Context, client client.Client, id, runID string) error {
	hist, err := GetWorkflowHistory(ctx, client, id, runID)

```

The code above will cause the Worker to re-execute the Workflow's Workflow Function using the original Event History.
If a noticeably different code path was followed or some code caused a deadlock, it will be returned in the error code.
Replaying a Workflow Execution locally is a good way to see exactly what code path was taken for given input and events.

Workflows in Temporal may be replayed from the beginning of their history when resumed. In order for Temporal to recreate the exact state Workflow code was in, the code is required to be fully deterministic. To prevent breaking [determinism](/typescript/determinism), in the TypeScript SDK, Workflow code runs in an isolated execution environment and may not use any of the Node.js APIs or communicate directly with the outside world.

See how to replay in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN5bIL7wc5M).
