The observability section of the Temporal Application development guide covers the many ways to view the current state of your [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application)—that is, ways to view which [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution) are tracked by the [Temporal Platform](/temporal#temporal-platform) and the state of any specified Workflow Execution, either currently or at points of an execution.

:::info WORK IN PROGRESS

This guide is a work in progress.
Some sections may be incomplete or missing for some languages.
Information may change at any time.

If you can't find what you are looking for in the Application development guide, it could be in [older docs for SDKs](/sdks).

:::

This section covers features related to viewing the state of the application, including:

- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [Tracing](#tracing)
- [Logging](#logging)
- [Visibility](#visibility)

## Metrics

Each Temporal SDK is capable of emitting an optional set of metrics from either the Client or the Worker process.
For a complete list of metrics capable of being emitted, see the [SDK metrics reference](/references/sdk-metrics).

Metrics can be scraped and stored in time series databases, such as:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
- [M3db](https://m3db.io/docs/)
- [statsd](https://github.com/statsd/statsd)

Temporal also provides a dashboard you can integrate with graphing services like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/). For more information, see:

- Temporal's implementation of the [Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards)
- [How to export metrics in Grafana](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts#exploring-metrics-via-grafana)

<TabItem value="go">

To emit metrics from the Temporal Client in Go, create a [metrics handler](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal/common/metrics#Handler) from the [Client Options](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ClientOptions) and specify a listener address to be used by Prometheus.

```go
client.Options{
		MetricsHandler: sdktally.NewMetricsHandler(newPrometheusScope(prometheus.Configuration{
			ListenAddress: "0.0.0.0:9090",
			TimerType:     "histogram",
		}
```

The Go SDK currently supports the [Tally](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/tally) library; however, Tally offers [extensible custom metrics reporting](https://github.com/uber-go/tally#report-your-metrics), which is exposed through the [`WithCustomMetricsReporter`](/references/server-options#withcustommetricsreporter) API.

For more information, see the [Go sample for metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/metrics).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

To emit metrics with the Java SDK, use [`MicrometerClientStatsReporter`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/55ee7894aec427d7e384c3519732bdd61119961a/src/main/java/io/temporal/common/reporter/MicrometerClientStatsReporter.java#L34) class to integrate with Micrometer MeterRegistry configured for your metrics backend.
[Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/docs) is a popular Java framework that provides integration with Prometheus and other backends.

The following example shows how to use `MicrometerClientStatsReporter` to define the metrics scope and set it with the `WorkflowServiceStubsOptions`.

```java
//...
   // see the Micrometer documentation for configuration details on other supported monitoring systems.
   // in this example shows how to set up Prometheus registry and stats reported.
   PrometheusMeterRegistry registry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry(PrometheusConfig.DEFAULT);
   StatsReporter reporter = new MicrometerClientStatsReporter(registry);
    // set up a new scope, report every 10 seconds
     Scope scope = new RootScopeBuilder()
             .reporter(reporter)
             .reportEvery(com.uber.m3.util.Duration.ofSeconds(10));
   // for Prometheus collection, expose a scrape endpoint.
   //...
   // add metrics scope to WorkflowServiceStub options
   WorkflowServiceStubsOptions stubOptions =
       WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder().setMetricsScope(scope).build();
//...
```

For more details, see the [Java SDK Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/main/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/metrics).

Workers can emit metrics and traces. There are a few [telemetry options](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.TelemetryOptions) that can be provided to [`Runtime.install`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.runtime/#install). The common options are:

- `metrics: { otel: { url } }`: The URL of a gRPC [OpenTelemetry collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).
- `metrics: { prometheus: { bindAddress } }`: Address on the Worker host that will have metrics for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to scrape.

To set up tracing of Workflows and Activities, use our [opentelemetry-interceptors](/typescript/logging#opentelemetry-tracing) package.

```typescript
  telemetryOptions: {
      metrics: {
        prometheus: { bindAddress: '0.0.0.0:9464' },
      },
      logging: { forward: { level: 'DEBUG' } },
    },
```

## Tracing

Tracing allows you to view the call graph of a Workflow along with its Activities and any child Workflows.

Temporal Web's tracing capabilities mainly track Activity Execution within a Temporal context. If you need custom tracing specific for your use case, you should make use of context propagation to add tracing logic accordingly.

For information about Workflow tracing, see [Tracing Temporal Workflows with DataDog](https://spiralscout.com/blog/tracing-temporal-workflow-with-datadog).

For information about how to configure exporters and instrument your code, see [Tracing Temporal Services with OTEL](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/develop/docs/tracing.md).

<TabItem value="go">

The Go SDK provides support for distributed tracing through [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/).
Tracing allows you to view the call graph of a Workflow along with its Activities and any child Workflows.

Tracing can be configured by providing an [opentracing.Tracer](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go#Tracer)
implementation in [ClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions) during client instantiation.

For more details on how to configure and leverage tracing, see the [OpenTracing documentation](https://opentracing.io/docs/getting-started/).

The OpenTracing support has been validated using [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), but other implementations mentioned [here](https://opentracing.io/docs/supported-tracers/) should also work.

Tracing functionality utilizes generic context propagation provided by the Client.

The [`interceptors-opentelemetry`](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/interceptors-opentelemetry) sample shows how to use the SDK's built-in OpenTelemetry tracing to trace everything from starting a Workflow to Workflow Execution to running an Activity from that Workflow.

The built-in tracing uses protobuf message headers (like [this one](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/b2b8ae6592a8730dd5be6d90569d1aea84e1712f/temporal/api/workflowservice/v1/request_response.proto#L161) when starting a Workflow) to propagate the tracing information from the client to the Workflow and from the Workflow to its successors (when Continued As New), children, and Activities.
All of these executions are linked with a single trace identifier and have the proper `parent -> child` span relation.

Tracing is compatible between different Temporal SDKs as long as compatible [context propagators](https://opentelemetry.lightstep.com/core-concepts/context-propagation/) are used.

**Context propagation**

The TypeScript SDK uses the global OpenTelemetry propagator.

To extend the default ([Trace Context](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/packages/opentelemetry-core/README.md#w3ctracecontextpropagator-propagator) and [Baggage](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/packages/opentelemetry-core/README.md#baggage-propagator) propagators) to also include the [Jaeger propagator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger), follow these steps:

- `npm i @opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger`

- At the top level of your Workflow code, add the following lines:

  ```js
  import {propagation} from "@opentelemetry/api";
  import {
    CompositePropagator,
    W3CTraceContextPropagator,
    W3CBaggagePropagator,
  } from "@opentelemetry/core";
  import {JaegerPropagator} from "@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger";

  propagation.setGlobalPropagator(
    new CompositePropagator({
      propagators: [
        new W3CTraceContextPropagator(),
        new W3CBaggagePropagator(),
        new JaegerPropagator(),
      ],
    })
  );
  ```

Similarly, you can customize the OpenTelemetry `NodeSDK` propagators by following the instructions in the [Initialize the SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/experimental/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-node#initialize-the-sdk) section of the README.

## Logging

Send logs and errors to a logging service, so that when things go wrong, you can see what happened.

The SDK core uses `WARN` for its default logging level.

In Workflow Definitions you can use [`workflow.GetLogger(ctx)`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLogger) to write logs.

```go
import (
	"context"
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/activity"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

// Workflow is a standard workflow definition.
// Note that the Workflow and Activity don't need to care that
// their inputs/results are being compressed.
func Workflow(ctx workflow.Context, name string) (string, error) {
// ...

workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)

// Getting the logger from the context.
	logger := workflow.GetLogger(ctx)
// Logging a message with the key value pair `name` and `name`
	logger.Info("Compressed Payloads workflow started", "name", name)

	info := map[string]string{
		"name": name,
	}


	logger.Info("Compressed Payloads workflow completed.", "result", result)

	return result, nil
}
```

You can log from a Workflow using Python's standard library, by importing the logging module `import logging`.

Set your logging configuration to a level you want to expose logs to.
The following example sets the logging information level to `INFO`.

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

Then in your Workflow, set your [`logger`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#logger) and level on the Workflow. The following example logs the Workflow.

```python
@workflow.defn
class SayHelloWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        workflow.logger.info(f"Running workflow with parameter {name}")
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity, name, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10)
        )
```

The following is an example output:

```
INFO:temporalio.workflow:Running workflow with parameter Temporal ({'attempt': 1, 'your-custom-namespace': 'default', 'run_id': 'your-run-id', 'task_queue': 'your-task-queue', 'workflow_id': 'your-workflow-id', 'workflow_type': 'SayHelloWorkflow'})
```

:::note

Logs are skipped during replay by default.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

Logging from Workflows is tricky for two reasons:

1. Workflows run in a sandboxed environment and cannot do any I/O.
1. Workflow code might get replayed at any time, generating duplicate log messages.

To work around these limitations, we recommend using the Sinks feature in the TypeScript SDK.
Sinks enable one-way export of logs, metrics, and traces from the Workflow isolate to the Node.js environment.

<!--
Workflows in Temporal may be replayed from the beginning of their history when resumed. In order for Temporal to recreate the exact state Workflow code was in, the code is required to be fully deterministic. To prevent breaking [determinism](/typescript/determinism), in the TypeScript SDK, Workflow code runs in an isolated execution environment and may not use any of the Node.js APIs or communicate directly with the outside world. -->

Sinks are written as objects with methods. Similar to Activities, they are declared in the Worker and then proxied in Workflow code, and it helps to share types between both.

<details>
  <summary>Comparing Sinks, Activities and Interceptors</summary>
  
Sinks are similar to Activities in that they are both registered on the Worker and proxied into the Workflow.
However, they differ from Activities in important ways:

- Sink functions don't return any value back to the Workflow and cannot not be awaited.
- Sink calls are not recorded in Workflow histories (no timeouts or retries).
- Sink functions are _always_ run on the same Worker that runs the Workflow they are called from.

</details>

**Declaring the Sink Interface**

Explicitly declaring a Sink's interface is optional, but is useful for ensuring type safety in subsequent steps:

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-interface-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

**Implementing Sinks**

Implementing Sinks is a two-step process.

Implement and inject the Sink function into a Worker

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-worker-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

- Sink function implementations are passed as an object into [WorkerOptions](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.workeroptions/#sinks)
- You can specify whether you want the injected function to be called during Workflow replay by setting the `callDuringReplay` boolean option.

**Proxy and call a Sink function from a Workflow**

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-logger-sink-workflow-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

Some important features of the [InjectedSinkFunction](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.InjectedSinkFunction) interface:

- **Injected WorkflowInfo argument**: The first argument of a Sink function implementation is a [`workflowInfo` object](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.workflowinfo/) that contains useful metadata.
- **Limited arguments types**: The remaining Sink function arguments are copied between the sandbox and the Node.js environment using the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm).
- **No return value**: To prevent breaking determinism, Sink functions cannot return values to the Workflow.

**Advanced: Performance considerations and non-blocking Sinks**

The injected sink function contributes to the overall Workflow Task processing duration.

- If you have a long-running sink function, such as one that tries to communicate with external services, you might start seeing Workflow Task timeouts.
- The effect is multiplied when using `callDuringReplay: true` and replaying long Workflow histories because the Workflow Task timer starts when the first history page is delivered to the Worker.

### Custom logger

Use a custom logger for logging.

<Tabs

groupId="site-lang"

<TabItem value="go">

This field sets a custom Logger that is used for all logging actions of the instance of the Temporal Client.

Although the Go SDK does not support most third-party logging solutions natively, [our friends at Banzai Cloud](https://github.com/sagikazarmark) built the adapter package [logur](https://github.com/logur/logur) which makes it possible to use third party loggers with minimal overhead.
Most of the popular logging solutions have existing adapters in Logur, but you can find a full list [in the Logur Github project](https://github.com/logur?q=adapter-).

Here is an example of using Logur to support [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus):

```go
package main
import (
  "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"

	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
	logrusadapter "logur.dev/adapter/logrus"
	"logur.dev/logur"
)

func main() {
  // ...
  logger := logur.LoggerToKV(logrusadapter.New(logrus.New()))
  clientOptions := client.Options{
    Logger: logger,
  }
  temporalClient, err := client.Dial(clientOptions)
  // ...
}
```

**Logging in Workers and Clients**

The Worker comes with a default logger which defaults to log any messages with level `INFO` and higher to `STDERR` using `console.error`.
The following [log levels](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/worker#loglevel) are listed in increasing order of severity.

**Customizing the default logger**

Temporal uses a [`DefaultLogger`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.defaultlogger/) that implements the basic interface:

```ts
import {Runtime, DefaultLogger} from "@temporalio/worker";

const logger = new DefaultLogger("WARN", ({level, message}) => {
  console.log(`Custom logger: ${level} — ${message}`);
});
Runtime.install({logger});
```

The previous code example sets the default logger to only log messages with level `WARN` and higher.

**Accumulate logs for testing and reporting**

```ts
import {DefaultLogger, LogEntry} from "@temporalio/worker";

const logs: LogEntry[] = [];
const logger = new DefaultLogger("TRACE", (entry) => logs.push(entry));
log.debug("hey", {a: 1});
log.info("ho");
log.warn("lets", {a: 1});
log.error("go");
```

A common logging use case is logging to a file to be picked up by a collector like the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/nodejs/?tab=winston30).

```ts
import {Runtime} from "@temporalio/worker";
import winston from "winston";

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: "info",
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [new transports.File({filename: "/path/to/worker.log"})],
});
Runtime.install({logger});
```

## Visibility

The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.

### Search Attributes

The typical method of retrieving a Workflow Execution is by its Workflow Id.

However, sometimes you'll want to retrieve one or more Workflow Executions based on another property. For example, imagine you want to get all Workflow Executions of a certain type that have failed within a time range, so that you can start new ones with the same arguments.

You can do this with [Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute/).

- [**Default** Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute/#default-search-attributes) like `WorkflowType`, `StartTime` and `ExecutionStatus` are automatically added to Workflow Executions.
- _Custom Search Attributes_ can contain their own domain-specific data (like `customerId` or `numItems`).
  - A few [generic Custom Search Attributes](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute/#custom-search-attributes) like `CustomKeywordField` and `CustomIntField` are created by default in Temporal's [Docker Compose](/clusters/quick-install/#docker-compose).

The steps to using custom Search Attributes are:

- Create a new Search Attribute in your Cluster [using `tctl`](/tctl/admin/cluster/add-search-attributes) or the Cloud UI.
- Set the value of the Search Attribute for a Workflow Execution:
  - On the Client by including it as an option when starting the Execution.
  - In the Workflow by calling `UpsertSearchAttributes`.
- Read the value of the Search Attribute:
  - On the Client by calling `DescribeWorkflow`.
  - In the Workflow by looking at `WorkflowInfo`.
- Query Workflow Executions by the Search Attribute using a [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter/):
  - [In `tctl`](/tctl/workflow/list/#--query).
  - In code by calling `ListWorkflowExecutions`.

Here is how to query Workflow Executions:

const connection = await Connection.connect();
const response = await connection.workflowService.listWorkflowExecutions({
  query: `ExecutionStatus = "Running"`,
});
```

where `query` is a [List Filter](/concepts/what-is-a-list-filter/).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Custom Search Attributes

After you've created custom Search Attributes in your Cluster ([using `tctl`](/tctl/admin/cluster/add-search-attributes) or the Cloud UI), you can set the values of the custom Search Attributes when starting a Workflow.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Python', value: 'python'},{label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

Provide key-value pairs in [`StartWorkflowOptions.SearchAttributes`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#StartWorkflowOptions).

Search Attributes are represented as `map[string]interface{}`.
The values in the map must correspond to the [Search Attribute's value type](/concepts/what-is-a-search-attribute/#types):

- Bool = `bool`
- Datetime = `time.Time`
- Double = `float64`
- Int = `int64`
- Keyword = `string`
- Text = `string`

If you had custom Search Attributes `CustomerId` of type Keyword and `MiscData` of type Text, you would provide `string` values:

```go
func (c *Client) CallYourWorkflow(ctx context.Context, workflowID string, payload map[string]interface{}) error {
    // ...
    searchAttributes := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomerId": payload["customer"],
        "MiscData": payload["miscData"]
    }
    options := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
        SearchAttributes:   searchAttributes
        // ...
    }
    we, err := c.Client.ExecuteWorkflow(ctx, options, app.YourWorkflow, payload)
    // ...
}
```

handle = await client.start_workflow(
    "your-workflow-name",

    task_queue="your-task-queue",
    search_attributes={"Your-Custom-Keyword-Field": ["value"]},

Use [`WorkflowOptions.searchAttributes`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowOptions#searchattributes).

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-search-attributes-client-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

The type of `searchAttributes` is `Record<string, string[] | number[] | boolean[] | Date[]>`.

</TabItem>

### Upsert Search Attributes

You can upsert Search Attributes to add or update Search Attributes from within Workflow code.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
groupId="site-lang"

<TabItem value="go">

In advanced cases, you may want to dynamically update these attributes as the Workflow progresses.
[UpsertSearchAttributes](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#UpsertSearchAttributes) is used to add or update Search Attributes from within Workflow code.

`UpsertSearchAttributes` will merge attributes to the existing map in the Workflow.
Consider this example Workflow code:

```go
func YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, input string) error {

    attr1 := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomIntField": 1,
        "CustomBoolField": true,
    }
    workflow.UpsertSearchAttributes(ctx, attr1)

    attr2 := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomIntField": 2,
        "CustomKeywordField": "seattle",
    }
    workflow.UpsertSearchAttributes(ctx, attr2)
}
```

After the second call to `UpsertSearchAttributes`, the map will contain:

```go
map[string]interface{}{
    "CustomIntField": 2, // last update wins
    "CustomBoolField": true,
    "CustomKeywordField": "seattle",
}
```

<TabItem value="python">

To upsert custom Search Attributes, use the [`upsert_search_attributes()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#upsert_search_attributes) function and set it to an empty list.

The keys are added to or replace the existing Search Attributes, similar to [`dict.update()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.update).

```python
workflow.upsert_search_attributes({"Your-Custom-Keyword-Field": ["new-value"]})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

Inside a Workflow, we can read from [`WorkflowInfo.searchAttributes`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowInfo#searchattributes) and call [`upsertSearchAttributes`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#upsertsearchattributes):

### Remove Search Attribute

To remove a Search Attribute that was previously set, set it to an empty array: `[]`.

<Tabs

<TabItem value="go">

**There is no support for removing a field.**

However, to achieve a similar effect, set the field to some placeholder value.
For example, you could set `CustomKeywordField` to `impossibleVal`.
Then searching `CustomKeywordField != 'impossibleVal'` will match Workflows with `CustomKeywordField` not equal to `impossibleVal`, which includes Workflows without the `CustomKeywordField` set.
