## Run a development server

This section describes how to install the [Temporal CLI](/cli) and run a development Cluster.
The local development Cluster comes packaged with the [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui).

For information on deploying and running a production Cluster, see the [Cluster deployment guide](/cluster-deployment-guide), or sign up for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud) and let us run your production Cluster for you.

Temporal CLI is a tool for interacting with a Temporal Cluster from the command line and it includes a distribution of the Temporal Server and Web UI.
This local development Cluster runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies and it supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.

**Install the Temporal CLI**

Choose one of the following install methods to install the Temporal CLI.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">

- Install the Temporal CLI with Homebrew.

## Connect to a dev Cluster

Communication with a Temporal Cluster includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.

:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.

:::

When you are running a Cluster locally (such as [Temporalite](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#temporalite)), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.
Many SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and [Docker Compose](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#docker-compose) serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).

Create an instance of the `$workflowClient` class and use the `create()` method to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Cluster.

Specify the target host, `localhost:7223`, parameter as a string and provide the TLS configuration for connecting to a Temporal Cluster.

```php
use Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient;
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowOptions;
# . . .
$workflowClient = Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient::create(
     ServiceClient::createSSL(
         'localhost:7233',
         'certs/ca.cert',
         'certs/client.key',
         'certs/client.pem',
         'tls-sample',
     ),
 );
```

To provide the client options as an environmental variable, add the `tls` option to the RoadRunner configuration file and pass the path to the file.

```yml
temporal:
  # . . .
  tls:
    key: "certs/client.key"
    cert: "certs/client.pem"
    root_ca: "certs/ca.cert"
    client_auth_type: require_and_verify_client_cert
    server_name: "tls-sample"
```

Then update your application and use the SSL connection for `ServiceClient`.

```php
$workflowClient = Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient::create(
     ServiceClient::createSSL(
         'localhost:7233',
         getenv('TEMPORAL_SERVER_ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH'),

Creating a [Connection](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.Connection) connects to the Temporal Cluster, and you can pass the `Connection` instance when creating the [Client](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.Client#connection).

If you omit the `Connection` and just create a `new Client()`, it will connect to `localhost:7233`.

```ts
import { Client } from '@temporalio/client';

async function run() {
  const client = new Client();

## Connect to Temporal Cloud

When you connect to [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), you need to provide additional connection and client options that include the following:

- An address that includes your <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Cloud Namespace Name<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and a port number: `<Namespace>.<ID>.tmprl.cloud:<port>`.
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/how-to-manage-certificates-in-temporal-cloud.md).

For more information about configuring TLS to secure inter- and intra-network communication for a Temporal Cluster, see [Temporal Customization Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server).

In the Temporal TypeScript SDK programming model, Workflow Definitions are _just functions_, which can store state and orchestrate Activity Functions.
The following code snippet uses `proxyActivities` to schedule a `greet` Activity in the system to say hello.

A Workflow Definition can have multiple parameters; however, we recommend using a single object parameter.

```typescript
type ExampleArgs = {
  name: string;
};

export async function example(
  args: ExampleArgs,
): Promise<{ greeting: string }> {
  const greeting = await greet(args.name);
  return { greeting };
}
```

### Workflow parameters

Temporal Workflows may have any number of custom parameters.
However, we strongly recommend that objects are used as parameters, so that the object's individual fields may be altered without breaking the signature of the Workflow.
All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable.

<Tabs

A method annotated with `#[WorkflowMethod]` can have any number of parameters.

We recommend passing a single parameter that contains all the input fields to allow for adding fields in a backward-compatible manner.

Note that all inputs should be serializable to a byte array using the provided [DataConverter](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/blob/master/src/DataConverter/DataConverterInterface.php) interface.
The default implementation uses a JSON serializer, but an alternative implementation can be easily configured.
You can create a custom object and pass it to the Workflow method, as shown in the following example:

```php
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface FileProcessingWorkflow {
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function processFile(Argument $args);
}
```

<TabItem value="typescript">

You can define and pass parameters in your Workflow. In this example, you define your arguments in your `client.ts` file and pass those parameters to `workflow.ts` through your Workflow function.

Start a Workflow with the parameters that are in the `client.ts` file. In this example we set the `name` parameter to `Temporal` and `born` to `2019`. Then set the Task Queue and Workflow Id.

`client.ts`

```typescript
import { example } from './workflows';

...
await client.start(example, {
  args: [{ name: 'Temporal', born: 2019 }],
  taskQueue: 'your-queue',
  workflowId: 'business-meaningful-id',
});
```

In `workflows.ts` define the type of the parameter that the Workflow function takes in. The interface `ExampleParam` is a name we can now use to describe the requirement in the previous example. It still represents having the two properties called `name` and `born` that is of the type `string`. Then define a function that takes in a parameter of the type `ExampleParam` and return a `Promise<string>`. The `Promise` object represents the eventual completion, or failure, of `await client.start()` and its resulting value.

```ts
interface ExampleParam {
  name: string;
  born: number;
}
export async function example({ name, born }: ExampleParam): Promise<string> {
  return `Hello ${name}, you were born in ${born}.`;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Workflow return values

Workflow return values must also be serializable.
Returning results, returning errors, or throwing exceptions is fairly idiomatic in each language that is supported.
However, Temporal APIs that must be used to get the result of a Workflow Execution will only ever receive one of either the result or the error.

interface ExampleParam {
  name: string;
  born: number;

export async function example({ name, born }: ExampleParam): Promise<string> {
  return `Hello ${name}, you were born in ${born}.`;

To customize a Workflow Type, use the `WorkflowMethod` annotation to specify the name of Workflow.

```php
#[WorkflowMethod(name)]
```

If a Workflow Type is not specified, then Workflow Type defaults to the interface name, which is `YourWorkflowDefinitionInterface` in this case.

```php
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface YourWorkflowDefinitionInterface
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function processFile(Argument $args);
}

Therefore, each language is limited to the use of certain idiomatic techniques.

\*\*Temporal uses the [Microsoft Azure Event Sourcing pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) to recover the state of a Workflow object including its local variable values.

In essence, every time a Workflow state has to be restored, its code is re-executed from the beginning.
When replaying, side effects (such as Activity invocations) are ignored because they are already recorded in the Workflow event history.
When writing Workflow logic, the replay is not visible, so the code should be written since it executes only once.
This design puts the following constraints on the Workflow implementation:

- Do not use any mutable global variables because multiple instances of Workflows are executed in parallel.
- Do not call any non-deterministic functions like non seeded random or `UUID` directly from the Workflow code.

Always do the following in the Workflow implementation code:

- Don’t perform any IO or service calls as they are not usually deterministic. Use Activities for this.
- Only use `Workflow::now()` to get the current time inside a Workflow.
- Call `yield Workflow::timer()` instead of `sleep()`.
- Do not use any blocking SPL provided by PHP (i.e. `fopen`, `PDO`, etc) in **Workflow code**.
- Use `yield Workflow::getVersion()` when making any changes to the Workflow code. Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code
  might break already open Workflows.
- Don’t access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow Execution path.
  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.

Workflow method arguments and return values are serializable to a byte array using the provided [DataConverter](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html) interface.
The default implementation uses JSON serializer, but you can use any alternative serialization mechanism.

Make sure to annotate your `WorkflowMethod` using `ReturnType` to specify concrete return type.

> You can not use the default return type declaration as Workflow methods are generators.

The values passed to Workflows through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the execution history.
The entire execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow workers with every event that the Workflow logic needs to process.
A large execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.
Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data that you transfer via Activity invocation parameters or return values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.\*\*

In the Temporal TypeScript SDK, Workflows run in a deterministic sandboxed environment.
The code is bundled on Worker creation using Webpack, and can import any package as long as it does not reference Node.js or DOM APIs.

:::note

If you **must** use a library that references a Node.js or DOM API and you are certain that those APIs are not used at runtime, add that module to the [ignoreModules](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.BundleOptions#ignoremodules) list.

:::

The Workflow sandbox can run only deterministic code, so side effects and access to external state must be done through Activities because Activity outputs are recorded in the Event History and can read deterministically by the Workflow.

This limitation also means that Workflow code cannot directly import the <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

To make the Workflow runtime deterministic, functions like `Math.random()`, `Date`, and `setTimeout()` are replaced by deterministic versions.

[FinalizationRegistry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/FinalizationRegistry) and [WeakRef](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakRef) are removed because v8's garbage collector is not deterministic.

## Develop Activities

One of the primary things that Workflows do is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
An Activity is a normal function or method execution that's intended to execute a single, well-defined action (either short or long-running), such as querying a database, calling a third-party API, or transcoding a media file.
An Activity can interact with world outside the Temporal Platform or use a Temporal Client to interact with a Cluster.
For the Workflow to be able to execute the Activity, we must define the <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- Activities execute in the standard Node.js environment.
- Activities cannot be in the same file as Workflows and must be separately registered.
- Activities may be retried repeatedly, so you may need to use idempotency keys for critical side effects.

Activities are _just functions_. The following is an Activity that accepts a string parameter and returns a string.

### Activity parameters

There is no explicit limit to the total number of parameters that an <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a> may support.
However, there is a limit of the total size of the data ends up encoded into a gRPC message Payload.

A single argument is limited to a maximum size of 2 MB.
And the total size of a gRPC message, which includes all the arguments, is limited to a maximum of 4 MB.

Also, keep in mind that all Payload data is recorded in the <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#event-history">Workflow Execution Event History<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Event History?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An append log of Events that represents the full state a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#event-history">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and large Event Histories can affect Worker performance.
This is because the entire Event History could be transferred to a Worker Process with a <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#workflow-task">Workflow Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Task is a Task that contains the context needed to make progress with a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#workflow-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

<!--TODO link to gRPC limit section when available -->

Some SDKs require that you pass context objects, others do not.
When it comes to your application data—that is, data that is serialized and encoded into a Payload—we recommend that you use a single object as an argument that wraps the application data passed to Activities.
This is so that you can change what data is passed to the Activity without breaking a function or method signature.

An optional `#[ActivityMethod]` annotation can be used to override a default Activity name.

You can define your own prefix for all Activity names by adding the `prefix` option to the `YourActivityInterface` annotation.
(The default prefix is empty.)

#[YourActivityInterface("file_activities.")]
interface FileProcessingActivities

    public function processFile(): string;

    public function deleteLocalFile(string $fileName);
}

The `#[YourActivityInterface("file_activities.")]` is an annotation that tells the PHP SDK to generate a class to implement the `FileProcessingActivities` interface. The functions define Activities that are used in the Workflow.

This results in the set of three <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task">Activity Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task contains the context needed to make an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a> related Events ([ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events/#activitytaskscheduled), [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events/#activitytaskstarted), and ActivityTask[Closed])in your Workflow Execution Event History.

A single instance of the Activities implementation is shared across multiple simultaneous Activity invocations.
Therefore, the Activity implementation code must be _stateless_.

The values passed to Activities through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the Execution history.
The entire Execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow Workers when a Workflow state needs to recover.
A large Execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.

Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data you transfer through Activity invocation parameters or Return Values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.

Activity implementation is an implementation of an Activity interface.
The following code example, uses a constructor that takes an Amazon S3 client and a local directory, and uploads a file to the S3 bucket.
Then, the code uses a function to download a file from the S3 bucket passing a bucket name, remote name, and local name as arguments.
Finally, it uses a function that takes a local file name as an argument and returns a string.

```php
// An implementation of an Activity interface.
class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {

    private S3Client $s3Client;

    private string $localDirectory;

    public function __construct(S3Client $s3Client, string $localDirectory) {
        $this->s3Client = $s3Client;
        $this->localDirectory = $localDirectory;
    }

    // Uploading a file to S3.
    public function upload(string $bucketName, string $localName, string $targetName): void
    {
        $this->s3Client->putObject(
            $bucketName,
            $targetName,
            fopen($this->localDirectory . $localName, 'rb+')
        );
    }

// Downloading a file from S3.

    }

// A function that takes a local file name as an argument and returns a string.
    public function processFile(string $localName): string

To spawn an Activity Execution, you must retrieve the _Activity handle_ in your Workflow.

```typescript
import { proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
// Only import the activity types
import type * as activities from './activities';

const { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',
});

// A workflow that calls an activity
export async function example(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return await greet(name);
}
```

This imports the individual Activities and declares the type alias for each Activity.

### Required timeout

Activity Execution semantics rely on several parameters.
The only required value that needs to be set is either a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Schedule-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Start-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
These values are set in the Activity Options.

`Workflow::newActivityStub`returns a client-side stub an implements an Activity interface. The client-side stub can be used within the Workflow code. It takes the Activity's type and`ActivityOptions` as arguments.

Calling (via `yield`) a method on this interface invokes an Activity that implements this method.
An Activity invocation synchronously blocks until the Activity completes, fails, or times out.
Even if Activity Execution takes a few months, the Workflow code still sees it as a single synchronous invocation.
It doesn't matter what happens to the processes that host the Workflow.
The business logic code just sees a single method call.

```php
class GreetingWorkflow implements GreetingWorkflowInterface
{
    private $greetingActivity;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
            GreetingActivityInterface::class,
            ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 seconds'))
        );
    }

    public function greet(string $name): \Generator
    {
        // This is a blocking call that returns only after the activity has completed.
        return yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hello', $name);
    }
}
```

If different Activities need different options, like timeouts or a task queue, multiple client-side stubs can be created with different options.

```php
$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 seconds'))
);

$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 minutes'))
);
```

Since Activities are referenced by their string name, you can reference them dynamically to get the result of an Activity Execution.

```typescript
export async function DynamicWorkflow(activityName, ...args) {
  const acts = proxyActivities(/* activityOptions */);

  // these are equivalent
  await acts.activity1();
  await acts['activity1']();

  let result = await acts[activityName](...args);
  return result;
}
```

The `proxyActivities()` returns an object that calls the Activities in the function. `acts[activityName]()` references the Activity using the Activity name, then it returns the results.

A Worker Entity contains both a Workflow Worker and an Activity Worker so that it can make progress for either a Workflow Execution or an Activity Execution.

The [RoadRunner application server](https://roadrunner.dev/) will launch multiple Temporal PHP Worker processes based on provided `.rr.yaml` configuration.

Each Worker might connect to one or multiple Task Queues.
Worker poll _Temporal service_ for tasks, performs those tasks, and communicates task execution results back to the _Temporal service_.

Worker code are developed, deployed, and operated by Temporal customers.
To create a worker use `Temporal\WorkerFactory`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Temporal\WorkerFactory;

ini_set('display_errors', 'stderr');
include "vendor/autoload.php";

// factory initiates and runs task queue specific activity and workflow workers
$factory = WorkerFactory::create();

// Worker that listens on a Task Queue and hosts both workflow and activity implementations.
$worker = $factory->newWorker();

// Workflows are stateful. So you need a type to create instances.
$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(App\DemoWorkflow::class);

// Activities are stateless and thread safe. So a shared instance is used.
$worker->registerActivity(App\DemoActivity::class);

// In case an activity class requires some external dependencies provide a callback - factory
// that creates or builds a new activity instance. The factory should be a callable which accepts
// an instance of ReflectionClass with an activity class which should be created.
$worker->registerActivity(App\DemoActivity::class, fn(ReflectionClass $class) => $container->create($class->getName()));

// start primary loop
$factory->run();
```

You can configure task queue name using first argument of `WorkerFactory`->`newWorker`:

```php
$worker = $factory->newWorker('your-task-queue');
```

As mentioned above you can create as many Task Queue connections inside a single Worker Process as you need.

To configure additional WorkerOptions use `Temporal\Worker\WorkerOptions`:

```php
use Temporal\Worker\WorkerOptions;

$worker = $factory->newWorker(
    'your-task-queue',
    WorkerOptions::new()
        ->withMaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPollers(10)
);
```

Make sure to point the Worker file in application server configuration:

```yaml
rpc:
  listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:6001

server:
  command: "php worker.php"

temporal:
  address: "temporal:7233"
  activities:
    num_workers: 10
```

Create a Worker with `Worker.create()` (which establishes the initial gRPC connection), then call `worker.run()` on it (to start polling the Task Queue).

Below is an example of starting a Worker that polls the Task Queue named `tutorial`.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-hello-worker {"enable_source_link": false}-->

```ts
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as activities from './activities';

async function run() {
  // Step 1: Register Workflows and Activities with the Worker and connect to
  // the Temporal server.
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    activities,
    taskQueue: 'hello-world',
  });
  // Worker connects to localhost by default and uses console.error for logging.
  // Customize the Worker by passing more options to create():
  // https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker
  // If you need to configure server connection parameters, see docs:
  // https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/security#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls

  // Step 2: Start accepting tasks on the `hello-world` queue
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

`taskQueue` is the only required option, but you will also use `workflowsPath` and `activities` to register Workflows and Activities with the Worker.

A full example for Workers looks like this:

```typescript
import { NativeConnection, Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as activities from './activities';

async function run() {
  const connection = await NativeConnection.connect({
    // defaults port to 7233 if not specified
    address: 'foo.bar.tmprl.cloud',
    tls: {
      // set to true if TLS without mTLS
      // See docs for other TLS options
      clientCertPair: {
        crt: clientCert,
        key: clientKey,
      },
    },
  });

  const worker = await Worker.create({
    connection,
    namespace: 'foo.bar', // as explained in Namespaces section
    // ...
  });
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

See below for more Worker options.

**Workflow and Activity registration**

Workers bundle Workflow code and `node_modules` using Webpack v5 and execute them inside V8 isolates.
Activities are directly required and run by Workers in the Node.js environment.

Workers are very flexible – you can host any or all of your Workflows and Activities on a Worker, and you can host multiple Workers in a single machine.

There are three main things the Worker needs:

- `taskQueue`: the Task Queue to poll. This is the only required argument.
- `activities`: Optional. Imported and supplied directly to the Worker. Not the path.
- Workflow bundle:
- Either specify a `workflowsPath` to your `workflows.ts` file to pass to Webpack, e.g., `require.resolve('./workflows')`. Workflows will be bundled with their dependencies.
- Or pass a prebuilt bundle to `workflowBundle` instead if you prefer to handle the bundling yourself.

**Additional Worker Options**

This is a selected subset of options you are likely to use. Even more advanced options, particularly for performance tuning, are available in [the API reference](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions).

| Options         | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dataConverter` | Encodes and decodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Server. Supports `undefined`, `UintBArray`, and JSON.                                                                     |
| `sinks`         | Allows injection of Workflow Sinks (Advanced feature: see [Logging docs](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/logging))                                        |

## Run a Temporal Cloud Worker

To run a Worker that uses [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), you need to provide additional connection and client options that include the following:

- An address that includes your <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Cloud Namespace Name<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and a port number: `<Namespace>.<ID>.tmprl.cloud:<port>`.
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/how-to-manage-certificates-in-temporal-cloud.md).

### Register types

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it fails that Task.
However, the failure of the Task does not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

Worker listens on a Task Queue and hosts both Workflow and Activity implementations:

```php
// Workflows are stateful. So you need a type to create instances:
$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(App\DemoWorkflow::class);
// Activities are stateless and thread safe:
$worker->registerActivity(App\DemoActivity::class);
```

In case an activity class requires some external dependencies provide a callback - factory
that creates or builds a new activity instance. The factory should be a callable which accepts
an instance of ReflectionClass with an activity class which should be created.

```php
$worker->registerActivity(
    App\DemoActivity::class,
    fn(ReflectionClass $class) => $container->create($class->getName())
);
```

If you want to clean up some resources after activity is done, you may register a finalizer. This callback is called
after each activity invocation:

```php
$worker->registerActivityFinalizer(fn() => $kernel->showtdown());
```

In development, use [`workflowsPath`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions/#workflowspath):

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-worker-create -->

[snippets/src/worker.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/snippets/src/worker.ts)

```ts
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';

    taskQueue: 'snippets',
    activities,
  });

  await worker.run();
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

In this snippet, the Worker bundles the Workflow code at runtime.

In production, you can improve your Worker's startup time by bundling in advance: as part of your production build, call [`bundleWorkflowCode`](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/workers#prebuilt-workflow-bundles):

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-bundle-workflow -->

[production/src/scripts/build-workflow-bundle.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/production/src/scripts/build-workflow-bundle.ts)

```ts
import { bundleWorkflowCode } from '@temporalio/worker';
import { writeFile } from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';

async function bundle() {
  const { code } = await bundleWorkflowCode({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('../workflows'),
  });
  const codePath = path.join(__dirname, '../../workflow-bundle.js');

  await writeFile(codePath, code);
  console.log(`Bundle written to ${codePath}`);
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

Then the bundle can be passed to the Worker:

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-production-worker-->

[production/src/worker.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/production/src/worker.ts)

```ts
const workflowOption = () =>

    : { workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows') };

async function run() {

[Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) semantics rely on several parameters—that is, to start a Workflow Execution you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type, language-specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

In the examples below, all Workflow Executions are started using a Temporal Client.
To spawn Workflow Executions from within another Workflow Execution, use either the [Child Workflow](#child-workflows) or External Workflow APIs.

See the [Customize Workflow Type](#customize-workflow-type) section to see how to customize the name of the Workflow Type.

A request to spawn a Workflow Execution causes the Temporal Cluster to create the first Event ([WorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events/#workflowexecutionstarted)) in the Workflow Execution Event History.
The Temporal Cluster then creates the first Workflow Task, resulting in the first [WorkflowTaskScheduled](/references/events/#workflowtaskscheduled) Event.

Workflows can be started both synchronously and asynchronously.
You can use typed or untyped Workflows stubs available via `Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient`.
To create a Workflow Client:

```php
use Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient;
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient;

$workflowClient = WorkflowClient::create(ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233'));
```

**Synchronous start**

A synchronous start initiates a Workflow and then waits for its completion. The started Workflow will not rely on the
invocation process and will continue executing even if the waiting process crashes or stops.

Be sure to acquire the Workflow interface or class name you want to start.
For example:

```php
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface AccountTransferWorkflowInterface
{
    #[WorkflowMethod(name: "MoneyTransfer")]
    #[ReturnType('int')]
    public function transfer(
        string $fromAccountId,
        string $toAccountId,
        string $referenceId,
        int $amountCents
    );
}
```

To start the Workflow in sync mode:

```php
$accountTransfer = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class
);

$result = $accountTransfer->transfer(
    'fromID',
    'toID',
    'refID',
    1000
);
```

**Asynchronous start**

An asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller without waiting for a result.
This is the most common way to start Workflows in a live environment.

To start a Workflow asynchronously, pass the Workflow stub instance and start parameters into the `WorkflowClient`->`start` method.

```php
$accountTransfer = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class
);

$run = $this->workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);
```

After the Workflow is started, you can receive the Workflow Id via the `WorkflowRun` object returned by the `start` method:

```php
$run = $workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);

var_dump($run->getExecution()->getID());
```

**Recurring start**

You can start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule with <a class="tdlp" href="/application-development/features#temporal-cron-jobs">the CronSchedule option<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to use Temporal Cron Jobs</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/application-development/features#temporal-cron-jobs">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

When you have a Workflow Client, you can schedule the start of a Workflow with `client.start()`, specifying `workflowId`, `taskQueue`, and `args` and returning a Workflow handle immediately after the Server acknowledges the receipt.

```typescript
const handle = await client.start(example, {
  workflowId: 'your-workflow-id',
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
  args: ['argument01', 'argument02', 'argument03'], // this is typechecked against workflowFn's args
});
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
const result = await handle.result();
```

Calling `client.start()` and `client.execute()` send a command to Temporal Server to schedule a new Workflow Execution on the specified Task Queue. It does not actually start until a Worker that has a matching Workflow Type, polling that Task Queue, picks it up.

You can test this by executing a Workflow Client command without a matching Worker. Temporal Server records the command in Event History, but does not make progress with the Workflow Execution until a Worker starts polling with a matching Task Queue and Workflow Definition.

Workflow Execution run in a separate V8 isolate context in order to provide a [deterministic runtime](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/determinism).

### Set Task Queue

In most SDKs, the only Workflow Option that must be set is the name of the <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#task-queue">Task Queue<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Task Queue?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Task Queue is a first-in, first-out queue that a Worker Process polls for Tasks.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#task-queue">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

For any code to execute, a Worker Process must be running that contains a Worker Entity that is polling the same Task Queue name.

In PHP, a Task Queue is represented in code by its name as a `string`.
There are four places where the name of the Task Queue is supplied by the developer.

1. When starting a Workflow, a Task Queue name must be provided in the `StartWorkflowOptions`.

```php
// Create new Workflow Options and set the Task Queue
$workflowOptions = WorkflowOptions::new()
  ->withTaskQueue("Workflow-Task-Queue-1")
  // ...

$yourWorkflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
  YourWorkflowInterface::class,
  $workflowOptions
);

$result = $yourWorkflow->workflowMethod();
```

2. A Task Queue name must be provided as a parameter when creating a Worker.

```php
use Temporal\WorkerFactory;

// Create a Worker Factory
$factory = WorkerFactory::create();

// Set the Task Queue when creating the Worker
$worker = $factory->newWorker("Workflow-Task-Queue-1");

// Workflows are stateful. So you need a type to create instances.
$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(YourWorkflow::class);

// start primary loop
$factory->run();
```

A single Worker can listen to only one Task Queue.
And, it is important to remember that the name of the Task Queue the Worker is listening to must match the name of the Task Queue provided in the options to any given Workflow or Activity.

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it will fail that Task.
However, the failure of the Task will not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

3. Optionally, the name of a Task Queue can be provided in the `ActivityOptions` when calling an Activity from a Workflow.

```php
class YourWorkflow implements YourWorkflowInterface
{
  private $yourActivity;

  public function __construct()
  {
    // Create Activity options and set the Task Queue
    $activityOptions = ActivityOptions::new()
      ->withTaskQueue("Activity-Task-Queue-1")
      // ...

    // Create a new Activity Stub and pass the options
    $this->yourActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
      YourActivityInterface::class,
      $activityOptions
    );
  }

  public function workflowMethod(): \Generator
  {
    // Call the Activity
    return yield $this->yourActivity->activityMethod();
  }
}
```

If a Task Queue name is not provided in the `ActivityOptions`, then the Activity Tasks are placed in the same Task Queue as the Workflow Task Queue.

4. Optionally, the name of a Task Queue can be provided in the `ChildWorkflowOptions` when calling a Child Workflow.

```php
//Create new Child Workflow Options and set the Task Queue
$childWorkflowOptions = ChildWorkflowOptions::new()
    ->withTaskQueue("Child-Workflow-Task-Queue-1")
    // ...

// Create a new Child Workflow Stub and set the Task Queue
$childWorkflow = Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub(
    ChildWorkflowInterface::class,
    $childWorkflowOptions
);

// Call the Child Workflow method
$promise = $childWorkflow->workflowMethod();
```

If a Task Queue name is not provided in the `ChildWorkflowOptions`, then the Child Workflow Tasks are placed in the same Task Queue as the Parent Workflow Task Queue.

A Task Queue is a dynamic queue in Temporal polled by one or more Workers.

Workers bundle Workflow code and node modules using Webpack v5 and execute them inside V8 isolates. Activities are directly required and run by Workers in the Node.js environment.

Workers are flexible. You can host any or all of your Workflows and Activities on a Worker, and you can host multiple Workers on a single machine.

There are three main things the Worker needs:

- `taskQueue`: the Task Queue to poll. This is the only required argument.
- `activities`: Optional. Imported and supplied directly to the Worker.
- Workflow bundle, specify one of the following options:
  - a `workflowsPath` to your `workflows.ts` file to pass to Webpack. For example, `require.resolve('./workflows')`. Workflows will be bundled with their dependencies.
  - Or pass a prebuilt bundle to `workflowBundle`, if you prefer to handle the bundling yourself.

```ts
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as activities from './activities';

async function run() {
  // Step 1: Register Workflows and Activities with the Worker and connect to
  // the Temporal server.
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    activities,
    taskQueue: 'hello-world',
  });
  // Worker connects to localhost by default and uses console.error for logging.
  // Customize the Worker by passing more options to create():
  // https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker
  // If you need to configure server connection parameters, see docs:
  // /typescript/security#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls

  // Step 2: Start accepting tasks on the `tutorial` queue
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

`taskQueue` is the only required option; however, use `workflowsPath` and `activities` to register Workflows and Activities with the Worker.

When scheduling a Workflow, a `taskQueue` must be specified.

```ts
import { Connection, WorkflowClient } from '@temporalio/client';
// This is the code that is used to start a workflow.
const connection = await Connection.create();
const client = new WorkflowClient({ connection });
const result = await client.execute(yourWorkflow, {
  // required
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
  // required
  workflowId: 'your-workflow-id',
});
```

When creating a Worker, you must pass the `taskQueue` option to the `Worker.create()` function.

```ts
const worker = await Worker.create({
  // imported elsewhere
  activities,
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
});
```

Optionally, in Workflow code, when calling an Activity, you can specify the Task Queue by passing the `taskQueue` option to `proxyActivities()`, `startChild()`, or `executeChild()`. If you do not specify a `taskQueue`, then the TypeScript SDK places Activity and Child Workflow Tasks in the same Task Queue as the Workflow Task Queue.

### Workflow Id

Although it is not required, we recommend providing your own <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-id">Workflow Id<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Id?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Id is a customizable, application-level identifier for a Workflow Execution that is unique to an Open Workflow Execution within a Namespace.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-id">Learn more</a></span></span></a> that maps to a business process or business entity identifier, such as an order identifier or customer identifier.

The following code example grabs the `userID` as an input and uses it to start the Workflow. The `userID` is used as Workflow Id. You can use this to cancel your Workflow later.

```php
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface SubscriptionWorkflowInterface
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function subscribe(string $userID);
}
```

The following code example, uses the input parameter `userID` as the Workflow Id.

```php
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface SubscriptionWorkflowInterface
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function subscribe(
        string $userID
    );
}
```

You can also set the Workflow Id as a constant, for example:

```php
public const WORKFLOW_ID = Your-Workflow-Id
```

Connect to a Client with `client.start()` and any arguments. Then specify your `taskQueue` and set your `workflowId` to a meaningful business identifier.

```typescript
const handle = await client.start(example, {
  workflowId: 'yourWorkflowId',
  taskQueue: 'yourTaskQueue',
  args: ['your', 'arg', 'uments'],
});
```

This starts a new Client with the given Workflow Id, Task Queue name, and an argument.

### Get Workflow results

If the call to start a Workflow Execution is successful, you will gain access to the Workflow Execution's Run Id.

The Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace may be used to uniquely identify a Workflow Execution in the system and get its result.

It's possible to both block progress on the result (synchronous execution) or get the result at some other point in time (asynchronous execution).

In the Temporal Platform, it's also acceptable to use Queries as the preferred method for accessing the state and results of Workflow Executions.

To return the results of a Workflow Execution:

```typescript
return (
  'Completed '
  + wf.workflowInfo().workflowId
  + ', Total Charged: '
  + totalCharged
);
```

`totalCharged` is just a function declared in your code. For a full example, see [subscription-workflow-project-template-typescript/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/subscription-workflow-project-template-typescript/blob/main/src/workflows.ts).

A Workflow function may return a result. If it doesn’t (in which case the return type is `Promise<void>`), the result will be `undefined`.

If you started a Workflow with `handle.start()`, you can choose to wait for the result anytime with `handle.result()`.

```typescript
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
const result = await handle.result();
```

Using a Workflow Handle isn't necessary with `client.execute()`.

Workflows that prematurely end will throw a `WorkflowFailedError` if you call `result()`.

If you call `result()` on a Workflow that prematurely ended for some reason, it throws a [`WorkflowFailedError` error](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowFailedError/) that reflects the reason. For that reason, it is recommended to catch that error.

```typescript
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
try {
  const result = await handle.result();
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof WorkflowFailedError) {
    throw new Error('Temporal workflow failed: ' + workflowId, {
      cause: err,
    });
  } else {
    throw new Error('error from Temporal workflow ' + workflowId, {
      cause: err,
    });
  }
}
```
