The following sections list methods for deploying your Temporal development Clusters.

- [Temporalite](#temporalite): This distribution of Temporal runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies.
- [Docker](#docker-compose): Using Docker Compose simplifies developing your Temporal Application.
- [Gitpod](#gitpod): One-click deployments are available for Go and TypeScript.

**For information on deploying a [production environment](/server/production-deployment), see the [Temporal Cloud](/cloud) documentation.**

### Temporalite

Temporalite is a distribution of Temporal that runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies.
It supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.

**Prerequisites**

Temporalite requires [Go 1.18 or later](https://go.dev/dl/).

**Build and start Temporalite**

The following steps start and run a Temporal Cluster.

1. Build from source.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/temporalio/temporalite.git
   cd temporalite
   go build ./cmd/temporalite
   ```
2. Start Temporalite by using the `start` command.
   ```bash
   ./temporalite start --namespace default
   ```
   Replace `default` with your [Namespace Name](/namespaces).

**Results**: You should have Temporal Cluster running at `http://127.0.0.1:7233` and the Temporal Web UI at [`http://127.0.0.1:8233`](http://127.0.0.1:8233/).

<!-- For macOS users, if you receive the `error setting up schema: stat /Users/<user_name>/Library/Application Support/temporalite/db:` error, then create the folders `temporalite/db` in your `Application Support` library. -->

### Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose and Temporal Cluster Docker images to quickly install and run a Temporal Cluster locally while developing Temporal Applications.

**Prerequisites**

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).

**Clone the repo and run Docker Compose**

The following steps start and run a Temporal Cluster using the default configuration.

1. Clone the [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
   ```
2. Change to the directory for the project.
   ```bash
   cd docker-compose
   ```
3. From your project directory, start your application.
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

**Results**: You should have Temporal Cluster running at `http://127.0.0.1:7233` and the Temporal Web UI at [`http://127.0.0.1:8080`](http://127.0.0.1:8080/).

To try other configurations (different dependencies and databases), or to try a custom Docker image, follow the [temporalio/docker-compose README](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose/blob/main/README.md).

### Gitpod

Run a Temporal Cluster and develop Temporal Applications in your browser using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/).

One-click deployments are available for the [temporalio/samples-go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go) repo and the [temporalio/samples-typescript](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript) repo.

A one-click deployment starts a Temporal Cluster using a Temporal Cluster Docker image, starts a Worker Process, and starts one of the application's sample Workflows.

A one-click deployment can take up to a full minute to get fully up and running.
When it is running, you can customize the application samples.

## Connect to a Cluster

A <a class="tdlp" href="/temporal#temporal-client">Temporal Client<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Client</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Client, provided by a Temporal SDK, provides a set of APIs to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/temporal#temporal-client">Learn more</a></span></span></a> enables you to communicate with the <a class="tdlp" href="/clusters#">Temporal Cluster<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cluster?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cluster is the Temporal Server paired with persistence.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/clusters#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
Communication with a Temporal Cluster includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.

:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.

:::

When you are running a Cluster locally (such as <a class="tdlp" href="#temporalite">Temporalite<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to quickly install a Temporal Cluster for testing and local development</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">There are four ways to quickly install and run a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#temporalite">Learn more</a></span></span></a>), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.
Many SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and <a class="tdlp" href="#docker-compose">Docker Compose<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to quickly install a Temporal Cluster for testing and local development</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">There are four ways to quickly install and run a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#docker-compose">Learn more</a></span></span></a> serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).

When you are connecting to a production Cluster (such as [Temporal Cloud](/cloud)), you will likely need to provide additional connection and client options that might include, but aren't limited to, the following:

- An address and port number.
- A <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Namespace<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> Name (like a Temporal Cloud Namespace: `<Namespace_ID>.tmprl.cloud`).
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/how-to-manage-certificates-in-temporal-cloud.md).

For more information about configuring TLS to secure inter and intra network communication for a Temporal Cluster, see [Temporal Customization Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server).

Use the [`Dial()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Dial) API available in the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client) package to create a new [`Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client).

If you don't provide [`HostPort`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions), the Client defaults the address and port number to `127.0.0.1:7233`.

Set a custom Namespace name in the Namespace field on an instance of the Client Options.

Use the [`ConnectionOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#ConnectionOptions) API to connect a Client with mTLS.

```go
import (
  // ...

  "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)
func main() {
    cert, err := tls.LoadX509KeyPair(clientCertPath, clientKeyPath)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    client, err := client.Dial(client.Options{
        HostPort:  "your-custom-namespace.tmprl.cloud:7233",
        Namespace: "your-custom-namespace",
        ConnectionOptions: client.ConnectionOptions{
            TLS: &tls.Config{Certificates: []tls.Certificate{cert}},
        },
    }
    defer temporalClient.Close()
  // ...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

To initialize a Workflow Client, create an instance of a `WorkflowClient`, create a client-side `WorkflowStub`, and then call a Workflow method (annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`).

To start a Workflow Execution, your Temporal Server must be running, and your front-end service must be accepting gRPC calls.

To establish a connection with the front-end service, use `WorkflowServiceStubs`.

```java
WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
```

You can provide `WorkflowServiceStubsOptions` to override the default values for the gRPC calls.

For example, the default front-end service gRPC address is set to `127.0.0.1:7233`, where `7233` is the default port for the Temporal Frontend Service.

If your server is running on a different host or port from the default, you can set it as shown in the following example.

```java
WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newInstance(
                    WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder()
                     .setTarget(TARGET_ENDPOINT)
                            .build());
```

After the connection to the Temporal Frontend Service is established, create a Client for the service stub.
The Workflow Client helps with client-side APIs and is required by Workers.

Create an instance of a `WorkflowClient` for the Workflow service stub, and use `WorkflowClientOptions` to set options for the Workflow Client.
The following example shows how to create a `WorkflowClient` instance called "client" for the `WorkflowServiceStubs` "service" that we created in the previous example, and set `Namespace` option for the `WorkflowClient`.

```java
WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(
                service,
                WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setNamespace(“Abc”)
                    .build());
```

For more information, see [WorkflowClientOptions](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClientOptions.Builder.html).

`WorkflowService` and `WorkflowClient` creation is a heavyweight operation, and will be resource-intensive if created each time you start a Workflow or send a Signal to it.
The recommended way is to create them once and reuse where possible.

With the Client defined, you can start interacting with the Temporal Frontend Service.

To initialize a Workflow in the Client, create a `WorkflowStub`, and start the Workflow Execution with `WorkflowClient.start()`.
Starting Workflows or sending Signals or Queries to Workflows from within a Client must be done using `WorkflowStubs`.

```java
WorkflowClient workflowClient =  WorkflowClient.newInstance(service, clientOptions);
 // Create a Workflow stub.
 YourWorkflow workflow = workflowClient.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class);
 // Start Workflow asynchronously and call its "yourWFMethod" Workflow method
 WorkflowClient.start(workflow::yourWFMethod);
```

Create an instance of the `$workflowClient` class and use the `create()` method to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Cluster.

Specify the target host, `localhost:7223`, parameter as a string and provide the TLS configuration for connecting to a Temporal Cluster.

```php
use Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient;
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowOptions;
# . . .
$workflowClient = Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient::create(

         'certs/client.key',
         'certs/client.pem',
         'tls-sample',

Declaring the `WorkflowClient()` creates a new connection to the Temporal service.

If you omit the connection and just call the `new WorkflowClient()`, you create a default connection that works locally.
However, always configure your connection and Namespace when [deploying to production](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/security/#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls).

Use the [`connectionOptions`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.ConnectionOptions) API available in the [`WorkflowClient`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowClient) package to create a new [`client`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/client/) to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.

Use a new `WorkflowClient()` with the requisite gRPC [`Connection`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.Connection#service) to connect to a Client and set your Namespace name.

Use the [`connectionOptions`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.TLSConfig) API to connect a Client with mTLS.

```typescript
import fs from "fs-extra";
import {Connection, WorkflowClient} from "@temporalio/client";

## Develop Workflows

Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Workflow Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

<TabItem value="go">

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Workflow Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is an exportable function.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context) error {
  // ...
  return nil
}
```

In Go, by default, the Workflow Type name is the same as the function name.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

In the Temporal Java SDK programming model, a Workflow Definition comprises a Workflow interface annotated with `@WorkflowInterface` and a Workflow implementation that implements the Workflow interface.

The Workflow interface is a Java interface and is annotated with `@WorkflowInterface`.
Each Workflow interface must have only one method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`.

```java
// Workflow interface
@WorkflowInterface
public interface YourWorkflow {

    @WorkflowMethod
    String yourWFMethod(Arguments args);
}
```

However, when using dynamic Workflows, do not specify a `@WorkflowMethod`, and implement the `DynamicWorkflow` directly in the Workflow implementation code.

The `@WorkflowMethod` identifies the method that is the starting point of the Workflow Execution.
The Workflow Execution completes when this method completes.

You can create interface inheritance hierarchies to reuse components across other Workflow interfaces.
The interface inheritance approach does not apply to `@WorkflowMethod` annotations.

A Workflow implementation implements a Workflow interface.

```java
// Define the Workflow implementation which implements our getGreeting Workflow method.
  public static class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {
      ...
    }
  }
```

To call Activities in your Workflow, call the Activity implementation.

Use `ExternalWorkflowStub` to start or send Signals from within a Workflow to other running Workflow Executions.

You can also invoke other Workflows as Child Workflows with `Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub()` or `Workflow.newUntypedChildWorkflowStub()` within a Workflow Definition.

Use [`DynamicWorkflow`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/workflow/DynamicWorkflow.html) to implement Workflow Types dynamically.
Register a Workflow implementation type that extends `DynamicWorkflow` to implement any Workflow Type that is not explicitly registered with the Worker.

The dynamic Workflow interface is implemented with the `execute` method. This method takes in `EncodedValues` that are inputs to the Workflow Execution.
These inputs can be specified by the Client when invoking the Workflow Execution.

```java
public class MyDynamicWorkflow implements DynamicWorkflow {
   @Override
    public Object execute(EncodedValues args) {
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

In the Temporal PHP SDK programming model, Workflows are a class method. Classes must implement interfaces that are annotated with `#[WorkflowInterface]`. The method that is the Workflow must be annotated with `#[WorkflowMethod]`.

```php
use Temporal\Workflow\YourWorkflowInterface;
use Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowMethod;

#[WorkflowInterface]
interface FileProcessingWorkflow
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function processFile(Argument $args);

}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

In the Temporal Python SDK programming model, Workflows are defined as classes.

Specify the [`@workflow.defn`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#defn) decorator on the Workflow class to identify a Workflow.

Use the [`@workflow.run`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#run) to mark the entry point method to be invoked.
This must be set on one asynchronous method defined on the same class as `@workflow.defn`.
Run methods have positional parameters.

```python
@workflow.defn
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity, name, schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5)
        )
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

In the Temporal TypeScript SDK programming model, Workflow Definitions are _just functions_, which can store state and orchestrate Activity Functions.
The following code snippet uses `proxyActivities` to schedule a `greet` Activity in the system to say hello.

A Workflow Definition can have multiple parameters; however, we recommend using a single object parameter.

```typescript
type ExampleArgs = {
  name: string;
};

export async function example(
  args: ExampleArgs,
): Promise<{ greeting: string }> {
  const greeting = await greet(args.name);
  return { greeting };
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Workflow parameters

Temporal Workflows may have any number of custom parameters.
However, we strongly recommend that objects are used as parameters, so that the object's individual fields may be altered without breaking the signature of the Workflow.
All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
queryString="lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Python', value: 'python'},{label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

The first parameter of a Go-based Workflow Definition must be of the [`workflow.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Context) type, as it is used by the Temporal Go SDK to pass around Workflow Execution context, and virtually all the Go SDK APIs that are callable from the Workflow require it.
It is acquired from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow) package.

```go
import (
   "go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param string) error {
 // ...
}
```

The `workflow.Context` entity operates similarly to the standard `context.Context` entity provided by Go.
The only difference between `workflow.Context` and `context.Context` is that the `Done()` function, provided by `workflow.Context`, returns `workflow.Channel` instead of the standard Go `chan`.

The second parameter, `string`, is a custom parameter that is passed to the Workflow when it is invoked.
A Workflow Definition may support multiple custom parameters, or none.
These parameters can be regular type variables or safe pointers.
However, the best practice is to pass a single parameter that is of a `struct` type, so there can be some backward compatibility if new parameters are added.

```go
type YourWorkflowParam struct {
 WorkflowParamFieldOne string
 WorkflowParamFieldTwo int
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {
 // ...
}
```

All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable, regardless of whether pointers or regular type values are used.
Parameters can’t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

A method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can have any number of parameters.

We recommend passing a single parameter that contains all the input fields to allow for adding fields in a backward-compatible manner.

Note that all inputs should be serializable by the default Jackson JSON Payload Converter.

You can create a custom object and pass it to the Workflow method, as shown in the following example.

```java
//...
@WorkflowInterface
public interface YourWorkflow {
    @WorkflowMethod
    String yourWFMethod(CustomObj customobj);
// ...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

A method annotated with `#[WorkflowMethod]` can have any number of parameters.

We recommend passing a single parameter that contains all the input fields to allow for adding fields in a backward-compatible manner.

Note that all inputs should be serializable to a byte array using the provided [DataConverter](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/blob/master/src/DataConverter/DataConverterInterface.php) interface.
The default implementation uses a JSON serializer, but an alternative implementation can be easily configured.
You can create a custom object and pass it to the Workflow method, as shown in the following example:

```php
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface FileProcessingWorkflow {
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function processFile(Argument $args);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

Workflow parameters are the method parameters of the singular method decorated with `@workflow.run`.
These can be any data type Temporal can convert, including [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) when properly type-annotated.
Technically this can be multiple parameters, but Temporal strongly encourages a single `dataclass` parameter containing all input fields.

```python
@dataclass
class YourParams:
    your_int_param: int
    your_str_param: str


@workflow.defn
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, params: YourParams) -> None:
        ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

You can define and pass parameters in your Workflow. In this example, you define your arguments in your `client.ts` file and pass those parameters to `workflow.ts` through your Workflow function.

Start a Workflow with the parameters that are in the `client.ts` file. In this example we set the `name` parameter to `Temporal` and `born` to `2019`. Then set the Task Queue and Workflow Id.

`client.ts`

```typescript
import { example } from './workflows';

...
await client.start(example, {
  args: [{ name: 'Temporal', born: 2019 }],
  taskQueue: 'your-queue',
  workflowId: 'business-meaningful-id',
});
```

In `workflows.ts` define the type of the parameter that the Workflow function takes in. The interface `ExampleParam` is a name we can now use to describe the requirement in the previous example. It still represents having the two properties called `name` and `born` that is of the type `string`. Then define a function that takes in a parameter of the type `ExampleParam` and return a `Promise<string>`. The `Promise` object represents the eventual completion, or failure, of `await client.start()` and its resulting value.

```ts
interface ExampleParam {
  name: string;
  born: number;
}
export async function example({ name, born }: ExampleParam): Promise<string> {
  return `Hello ${name}, you were born in ${born}.`;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Workflow return values

Workflow return values must also be serializable.
Returning results, returning errors, or throwing exceptions is fairly idiomatic in each language that is supported.
However, Temporal APIs that must be used to get the result of a Workflow Execution will only ever receive one of either the result or the error.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
queryString="lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Python', value: 'python'},{label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

A Go-based Workflow Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination.
Again, the best practice here is to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values.

```go
type YourWorkflowResponse struct{
 WorkflowResultFieldOne string
 WorkflowResultFieldTwo int
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
 // ...
 if err != nil {
   return "", err
 }
 responseVar := YourWorkflowResponse {
   FieldOne: "super",
   FieldTwo: 1,
 }
 return responseVar, nil
}
```

A Workflow Definition written in Go can return both a custom value and an error.
However, it's not possible to receive both a custom value and an error in the calling process, as is normal in Go.
The caller will receive either one or the other.
Returning a non-nil `error` from a Workflow indicates that an error was encountered during its execution and the Workflow Execution should be terminated, and any custom return values will be ignored by the system.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

Workflow method arguments and return values must be serializable and deserializable using the provided [`DataConverter`](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/1.17.0/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html).

The `execute` method for `DynamicWorkflow` can return type Object.
Ensure that your Client can handle an Object type return or is able to convert the Object type response.

<TabItem value="php">

A Workflow method returns a Generator.
To properly typecast the Workflow's return value in the client code, use the `#[ReturnType()]` annotation.

```php
#[YourWorkflowInterface]
interface FileProcessingWorkflow {

    #[WorkflowMethod]
    #[ReturnType("string")]
    public function processFile(Argument $args);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

To return a value of the Workflow, use `return` to return an object.

To return the results of a Workflow Execution, use either [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

```python
@dataclass
class YourResult:
    your_int_param: int
    your_str_param: str


@workflow.defn
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, params: YourResult) -> None:
      return YourResult
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

To return a value of the Workflow function, use `Promise<something>`. The `Promise` is used to make asynchronous calls and comes with guarantees.

The following example uses a `Promise<string>` to eventually return a `name` and `born` parameter.

```typescript
interface ExampleParam {
  name: string;
  born: number;
}
export async function example({ name, born }: ExampleParam): Promise<string> {
  return `Hello ${name}, you were born in ${born}.`;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Workflow Type

Workflows have a Type that are referred to as the Workflow name.

The following examples demonstrate how to set a custom name for your Workflow Type.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
queryString="lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Python', value: 'python'},{label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

To customize the Workflow Type, set the `Name` parameter with `RegisterOptions` when registering your Workflow with a Worker.

- Type: `string`
- Default: function name

```go
// ...
w := worker.New(temporalClient, "your_task_queue_name", worker.Options{})
registerOptions := workflow.RegisterOptions{
  Name: "YourWorkflowName",
  // ...
}
w.RegisterWorkflowWithOptions(YourWorkflowDefinition, registerOptions)
// ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

The Workflow Type defaults to the short name of the Workflow interface.
In the following example, the Workflow Type defaults to `NotifyUserAccounts`.

```java
  @WorkflowInterface

  public interface NotifyUserAccounts {
    @WorkflowMethod
    void notify(String[] accountIds);
}
```

To overwrite this default naming and assign a custom Workflow Type, use the `@WorkflowMethod` annotation with the `name` parameter.
In the following example, the Workflow Type is set to `Abc`.

```java
@WorkflowInterface

  public interface NotifyUserAccounts {
  @WorkflowMethod(name = "Abc")
  void notify(String[] accountIds);
  }
```

When you set the Workflow Type this way, the value of the `name` parameter does not have to start with an uppercase letter.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

To customize a Workflow Type, use the `WorkflowMethod` annotation to specify the name of Workflow.

```php
#[WorkflowMethod(name)]
```

If a Workflow Type is not specified, then Workflow Type defaults to the interface name, which is `YourWorkflowDefinitionInterface` in this case.

```php
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface YourWorkflowDefinitionInterface
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function processFile(Argument $args);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

You can customize the Workflow name with a custom name in the decorator argument. For example, `@workflow.defn(name="your-workflow-name")`. If the name parameter is not specified, the Workflow name defaults to the function name.

```python
@workflow.defn(name="your-workflow-name")
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity, name, schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5)
        )
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

In TypeScript, the Workflow Type is the Workflow function name and there isn't a mechanism to customize the Workflow Type.

In the following example, the Workflow Type is the name of the function, `helloWorld`.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-workflow-type -->

[snippets/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/snippets/src/workflows.ts)

```ts
export async function helloWorld(): Promise<string> {
  return '👋 Hello World!';
}
```

### Workflow logic requirements

Workflow logic is constrained by <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#deterministic-constraints">deterministic execution requirements<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#deterministic-constraints">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
Therefore, each language is limited to the use of certain idiomatic techniques.
However, each Temporal SDK provides a set of APIs that can be used inside your Workflow to interact with external (to the Workflow) application code.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
queryString="lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Python', value: 'python'},{label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

In Go, Workflow Definition code cannot directly do the following:

- Iterate over maps using `range`, because with `range` the order of the map's iteration is randomized.
  Instead you can collect the keys of the map, sort them, and then iterate over the sorted keys to access the map.
  This technique provides deterministic results.
  You can also use a Side Effect or an Activity to process the map instead.
- Call an external API, conduct a file I/O operation, talk to another service, etc. (Use an Activity for these.)

The Temporal Go SDK has APIs to handle equivalent Go constructs:

- `workflow.Now()` This is a replacement for `time.Now()`.
- `workflow.Sleep()` This is a replacement for `time.Sleep()`.
- `workflow.GetLogger()` This ensures that the provided logger does not duplicate logs during a replay.
- `workflow.Go()` This is a replacement for the `go` statement.
- `workflow.Channel` This is a replacement for the native `chan` type.
  Temporal provides support for both buffered and unbuffered channels.
- `workflow.Selector` This is a replacement for the `select` statement.
  Learn more on the [Go SDK Selectors](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/go/selectors) page.
- `workflow.Context` This is a replacement for `context.Context`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

When defining Workflows using the Temporal Java SDK, the Workflow code must be written to execute effectively once and to completion.

The following constraints apply when writing Workflow Definitions:

- Do not use mutable global variables in your Workflow implementations.
  This will ensure that multiple Workflow instances are fully isolated.
- Your Workflow code must be deterministic.
  Do not call non-deterministic functions (such as non-seeded random or `UUID.randomUUID()`) directly from the Workflow code.
  The Temporal SDK provides specific API for calling non-deterministic code in your Workflows.
- Do not use programming language constructs that rely on system time.
  For example, only use `Workflow.currentTimeMillis()` to get the current time inside a Workflow.
- Do not use native Java `Thread` or any other multi-threaded classes like `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
  Use `Async.function` or `Async.procedure`, provided by the Temporal SDK, to execute code asynchronously.
- Do not use synchronization, locks, or other standard Java blocking concurrency-related classes besides those provided by the Workflow class.
  There is no need for explicit synchronization because multi-threaded code inside a Workflow is executed one thread at a time and under a global lock.
  - Call `Workflow.sleep` instead of `Thread.sleep`.
  - Use `Promise` and `CompletablePromise` instead of `Future` and `CompletableFuture`.
  - Use `WorkflowQueue` instead of `BlockingQueue`.
- Use `Workflow.getVersion` when making any changes to the Workflow code.
  Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code might break already running Workflows.
- Do not access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow Execution path.
  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.
- Use `DynamicWorkflow` when you need a default Workflow that can handle all Workflow Types that are not registered with a Worker.
  A single implementation can implement a Workflow Type which by definition is dynamically loaded from some external source.
  All standard `WorkflowOptions` and determinism rules apply to Dynamic Workflow implementations.

\*\*Temporal uses the [Microsoft Azure Event Sourcing pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) to recover the state of a Workflow object including its local variable values.

In essence, every time a Workflow state has to be restored, its code is re-executed from the beginning.
When replaying, side effects (such as Activity invocations) are ignored because they are already recorded in the Workflow event history.
When writing Workflow logic, the replay is not visible, so the code should be written since it executes only once.
This design puts the following constraints on the Workflow implementation:

- Do not use any mutable global variables because multiple instances of Workflows are executed in parallel.
- Do not call any non-deterministic functions like non seeded random or `UUID` directly from the Workflow code.

Always do the following in the Workflow implementation code:

- Don’t perform any IO or service calls as they are not usually deterministic. Use Activities for this.
- Only use `Workflow::now()` to get the current time inside a Workflow.
- Call `yield Workflow::timer()` instead of `sleep()`.
- Do not use any blocking SPL provided by PHP (i.e. `fopen`, `PDO`, etc) in **Workflow code**.
- Use `yield Workflow::getVersion()` when making any changes to the Workflow code. Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code
  might break already open Workflows.
- Don’t access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow Execution path.
  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.

Workflow method arguments and return values are serializable to a byte array using the provided [DataConverter](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html) interface.
The default implementation uses JSON serializer, but you can use any alternative serialization mechanism.

Make sure to annotate your `WorkflowMethod` using `ReturnType` to specify concrete return type.

> You can not use the default return type declaration as Workflow methods are generators.

The values passed to Workflows through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the execution history.
The entire execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow workers with every event that the Workflow logic needs to process.
A large execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.
Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data that you transfer via Activity invocation parameters or return values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.\*\*

<TabItem value="python">

Workflow code must be deterministic. This means:

- no threading
- no randomness
- no external calls to processes
- no network I/O
- no global state mutation
- no system date or time

All API safe for Workflows used in the [`temporalio.workflow`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html) must run in the implicit [`asyncio` event loop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html) and be _deterministic_.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

In the Temporal TypeScript SDK, Workflows run in a deterministic sandboxed environment.
The code is bundled on Worker creation using Webpack, and can import any package as long as it does not reference Node.js or DOM APIs.

:::note

If you **must** use a library that references a Node.js or DOM API and you are certain that those APIs are not used at runtime, add that module to the [ignoreModules](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.BundleOptions#ignoremodules) list.

:::

The Workflow sandbox can run only deterministic code, so side effects and access to external state must be done through Activities because Activity outputs are recorded in the Event History and can read deterministically by the Workflow.

This limitation also means that Workflow code cannot directly import the <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

To make the Workflow runtime deterministic, functions like `Math.random()`, `Date`, and `setTimeout()` are replaced by deterministic versions.

[FinalizationRegistry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/FinalizationRegistry) and [WeakRef](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakRef) are removed because v8's garbage collector is not deterministic.

## Develop Activities

One of the primary things that Workflows do is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
An Activity is a normal function or method execution that's intended to execute a single, well-defined action (either short or long-running), such as querying a database, calling a third-party API, or transcoding a media file.
An Activity can interact with world outside the Temporal Platform or use a Temporal Client to interact with a Cluster.
For the Workflow to be able to execute the Activity, we must define the <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
queryString="lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Python', value: 'python'},{label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity Definition is an exportable function or a `struct` method.

**Function**

```go
// basic function signature
func YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context) error {
 // ...
 return nil
}

// with parameters and return values
func SimpleActivity(ctx context.Context, value string) (string, error)
```

**Struct method**

```go
type YourActivityStruct struct {
 ActivityFieldOne string
 ActivityFieldTwo int
}

func(a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context) error {
 // ...
}

func(a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinitionTwo(ctx context.Context) error {
 // ...
}
```

An _Activity struct_ can have more than one method, with each method acting as a separate Activity Type.
Activities written as struct methods can use shared struct variables, such as:

- an application level DB pool
- client connection to another service
- reusable utilities
- any other expensive resources that you only want to initialize once per process

Because this is such a common need, the rest of this guide shows Activities written as `struct` methods.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

An <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In day-to-day conversations, the term "Activity" frequently denotes either an Activity Type, an Activity Definition, or an Activity Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a combination of the Temporal Java SDK [Activity](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/0.19.0/io/temporal/activity/Activity.html) Class implementing a specially annotated interface.

An Activity interface is annotated with `@ActivityInterface` and an Activity implementation implements this Activity interface.
To handle Activity types that do not have an explicitly registered handler, you can directly implement a dynamic Activity.

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

Each method defined in the Activity interface defines a separate Activity method.
You can annotate each method in the Activity interface with the `@ActivityMethod` annotation, but this is completely optional.
The following example uses the `@ActivityMethod` annotation for the method defined in the previous example.

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {
    @ActivityMethod
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

An Activity implementation is a Java class that implements an Activity annotated interface.

```java
// Implementation for the GreetingActivities interface example from in the previous section
 static class GreetingActivitiesImpl implements GreetingActivities {
    @Override
    public String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name) {
      return greeting + " " + name + "!";
    }
  }
```

Use `DynamicActivity` to implement any number of Activity types dynamically.
When an Activity implementation that extends `DynamicActivity` is registered, it is called for any Activity type invocation that doesn't have an explicitly registered handler.

The dynamic Activity interface is implemented with the `execute` method, as shown in the following example.

```java
// Dynamic Activity implementation
 public static class DynamicGreetingActivityImpl implements DynamicActivity {
   @Override
   public Object execute(EncodedValues args) {
     String activityType = Activity.getExecutionContext().getInfo().getActivityType();
     return activityType
         + ": "
         + args.get(0, String.class)
         + " "
         + args.get(1, String.class)
         + " from: "
         + args.get(2, String.class);
   }
 }
```

Use `Activity.getExecutionContext()` to get information about the Activity type that should be implemented dynamically.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

Activities are defined as methods of a plain PHP interface annotated with `#[YourActivityInterface]`.
(You can also use PHP 8 attributes in PHP 7.)

Following is an example of an interface that defines four Activities:

```php
#[YourActivityInterface]
// Defining an interface for the activities.
interface FileProcessingActivities
{
    public function upload(string $bucketName, string $localName, string $targetName): void;

    #[ActivityMethod("transcode_file")]
    public function download(string $bucketName, string $remoteName): void;

    public function processFile(): string;

    public function deleteLocalFile(string $fileName): void;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

You can develop an Activity Definition by using the [`@activity.defn`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.activity.html#defn) decorator.

```python
@activity.defn
async def your_activity(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

You can register the function as an Activity with a custom name through a decorator argument. For example, `@activity.defn(name="your-activity")`.

```python
@activity.defn(name="your-activity")
async def your_activity(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**Types of Activities**

The following lists the different types of _Activity callables_:

- [Asynchronous Activities](#asynchronous-activities)
- [Synchronous Activities](#synchronous-activities)

:::note Positional arguments

Only positional arguments are supported by Activities.

:::

##### [Asynchronous Activities](#asynchronous-activities)

Asynchronous Activities (recommended) are functions using `async def`. When using asynchronous Activities there aren't any additional Worker parameters needed.

Cancellation for asynchronous activities is done by means of the
[`asyncio.Task.cancel`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task.cancel) operation. This means that `asyncio.CancelledError` will be raised (and can be caught, but it is not recommended).

An Activity must Heartbeat to receive cancellation.

##### [Synchronous Activities](#synchronous-activities)

The [`activity_executor`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.WorkerConfig.html#activity_executor) Worker parameter must be set with a [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor) instance to use for executing the Activities.

Cancellation for synchronous Activities is done in the background and the Activity must choose to listen for it and react appropriately.

An Activity must Heartbeat to receive cancellation.

- ###### [Synchronous Multithreaded Activities](#synchronous-multithreaded-activities)

Multithreaded Activities are functions that use `activity_executor` set to an instance of [`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor).

Besides `activity_executor`, no other additional Worker parameters are required for synchronous multithreaded Activities.

- ###### [Synchronous Multiprocess/Other Activities](#synchronous-multiprocess)

If `activity_executor` is set to an instance of [`concurrent.futures.Executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor) that is not `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, then the synchronous activities are considered multiprocess/other activities.

These require special primitives for heartbeating and cancellation. The `shared_state_manager` Worker parameter must be set to an instance of [`worker.SharedStateManager`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.SharedStateManager.html). The most common implementation can be created by passing a [`multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager) (for example, as a result of [`multiprocessing.managers.Manager()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Manager)) to [`worker.SharedStateManager.create_from_multiprocessing()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.SharedStateManager.html#create_from_multiprocessing).

<TabItem value="typescript">

- Activities execute in the standard Node.js environment.
- Activities cannot be in the same file as Workflows and must be separately registered.
- Activities may be retried repeatedly, so you may need to use idempotency keys for critical side effects.

Activities are _just functions_. The following is an Activity that accepts a string parameter and returns a string.

### Activity parameters

There is no explicit limit to the total number of parameters that an <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a> may support.
However, there is a limit of the total size of the data ends up encoded into a gRPC message Payload.

A single argument is limited to a maximum size of 2 MB.
And the total size of a gRPC message, which includes all the arguments, is limited to a maximum of 4 MB.

Also, keep in mind that all Payload data is recorded in the <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#event-history">Workflow Execution Event History<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Event History?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An append log of Events that represents the full state a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#event-history">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and large Event Histories can affect Worker performance.
This is because the entire Event History could be transferred to a Worker Process with a <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#workflow-task">Workflow Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Task is a Task that contains the context needed to make progress with a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#workflow-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

<!--TODO link to gRPC limit section when available -->

Some SDKs require that you pass context objects, others do not.
When it comes to your application data—that is, data that is serialized and encoded into a Payload—we recommend that you use a single object as an argument that wraps the application data passed to Activities.
This is so that you can change what data is passed to the Activity without breaking a function or method signature.

<Tabs

queryString="lang"

<TabItem value="go">

The first parameter of an Activity Definition is `context.Context`.
This parameter is optional for an Activity Definition, though it is recommended, especially if the Activity is expected to use other Go SDK APIs.

An Activity Definition can support as many other custom parameters as needed.
However, all parameters must be serializable (parameters can’t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers), and it is recommended to pass a single struct that can be updated later.

```go
type YourActivityParam struct {
 ActivityParamFieldOne string
 ActivityParamFieldTwo int
}

type YourActivityStruct struct {
 // ...
}

func (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) error {
 // ...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

An Activity interface can have any number of parameters.
All inputs should be serializable by the default Jackson JSON Payload Converter.

When implementing Activities, be mindful of the amount of data that you transfer using the Activity invocation parameters or return values as these are recorded in the Workflow Execution Events History.
Large Events Histories can adversely impact performance.

You can create a custom object, and pass it to the Activity interface, as shown in the following example.

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface YourActivities {
    String getCustomObject(CustomObj customobj);
    void sendCustomObject(CustomObj customobj, String abc);
}
```

The `execute` method in the dynamic Activity interface implementation takes in `EncodedValues` that are inputs to the Activity Execution, as shown in the following example.

```java
// Dynamic Activity implementation
 public static class DynamicActivityImpl implements DynamicActivity {
   @Override
   public Object execute(EncodedValues args) {
     String activityType = Activity.getExecutionContext().getInfo().getActivityType();
     return activityType
         + ": "
         + args.get(0, String.class)
         + " "
         + args.get(1, String.class)
         + " from: "
         + args.get(2, String.class);
   }
 }
```

Each method defines a single Activity type.
A single Workflow can use more than one Activity interface and call more than one Activity method from the same interface.

The only requirement is that Activity method arguments and return values are serializable to a byte array using the provided [DataConverter](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/blob/master/src/DataConverter/DataConverterInterface.php) interface.
The default implementation uses a JSON serializer, but an alternative implementation can be easily configured.

Activity parameters are the function parameters of the function decorated with `@activity.defn`.

Technically this can be multiple parameters, but Temporal strongly encourages a single `dataclass` parameter containing all input fields.

```python

### Activity return values

All data returned from an Activity must be serializable.

There is no explicit limit to the amount of data that can be returned by an Activity, but keep in mind that all return values are recorded in a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#event-history">Workflow Execution Event History<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Event History?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An append log of Events that represents the full state a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#event-history">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

<TabItem value="go">

A Go-based Activity Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination (same as a Workflow Definition).
You may wish to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values, just keep in mind they must all be serializable.

```go
type YourActivityResult struct{
  ActivityResultFieldOne string
  ActivityResultFieldTwo int
}

func (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (YourActivityResult, error) {
  // ...
  result := YourActivityResult {
    ActivityResultFieldOne: a.ActivityFieldOne,
    ActivityResultFieldTwo: a.ActivityFieldTwo,
  }
  return result, nil
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

Activity return values must be serializable and deserializable by the provided [`DataConverter`](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/1.17.0/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html).

The `execute` method for `DynamicActivity` can return type Object.
Ensure that your Workflow or Client can handle an Object type return or is able to convert the Object type response.

<TabItem value="php">

Return values must be serializable to a byte array using the provided [DataConverter](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/blob/master/src/DataConverter/DataConverterInterface.php) interface.
The default implementation uses a JSON serializer, but an alternative implementation can be easily configured.
Thus, you can return both primitive types:

```php
class GreetingActivity implements GreetingActivityInterface
{
    public function composeGreeting(string $greeting, string $name): string
    {
        return $greeting . ' ' . $name;
    }
}
```

And objects:

```php
class GreetingActivity implements GreetingActivityInterface
{
    public function composeGreeting(string $greeting, string $name): Greeting
    {
        return new Greeting($greeting, $name);
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

An Activity Execution can return inputs and other Activity values.

The following example defines an Activity that takes a string as input and returns a string.

```python
@activity.defn
async def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

In TypeScript, the return value is always a Promise.

In the following example, `Promise<string>` is the return value.

```typescript
export async function greet(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return `👋 Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Activity Type

Activities have a Type that are referred to as the Activity name.
The following examples demonstrate how to set a custom name for your Activity Type.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
queryString="lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Python', value: 'python'},{label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

To customize the Activity Type, set the `Name` parameter with `RegisterOptions` when registering your Activity with a Worker.

- Type: `string`
- Default: function name

```go
// ...
w := worker.New(temporalClient, "your_task_queue_name", worker.Options{})
registerOptions := activity.RegisterOptions{
  Name: "YourActivityName",
  // ...
}
w.RegisterActivityWithOptions(a.YourActivityDefinition, registerOptions)
// ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

The Activity Type defaults to method name, with the first letter of the method name capitalized, and can be customized using `namePrefix()` or `{ActivityMethod.name()}` to ensure they are distinct.

In the following example, the Activity Type defaults to `ComposeGreeting`.

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {
    @ActivityMethod
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

To overwrite this default naming and assign a custom Activity Type, use the `@ActivityMethod` annotation with the `name` parameter.
In the following example, the Activity Type is set to "greet".

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {
    @ActivityMethod(name = "greet")
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

You can also define a prefix for all of your Activity Types using the `namePrefix` parameter with the `@ActivityInterface` annotation.
The following example shows a `namePrefix` parameter applied to the `@ActivityInterface`, and two Activity methods, of which one is defined using the `@ActivityMethod` annotation.

```java
@ActivityInterface(namePrefix = "A_")
Public interface GreetingActivities {
    String sendGreeting(String input);

  @ActivityMethod(name = "abc")
  String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

In this example, the Activity type for the first method is set to `A_SendGreeting`.
The Activity type for the method annotated with `@ActivityMethod` is set to `A_abc`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

An optional `#[ActivityMethod]` annotation can be used to override a default Activity name.

You can define your own prefix for all Activity names by adding the `prefix` option to the `YourActivityInterface` annotation.
(The default prefix is empty.)

```php
#[YourActivityInterface("file_activities.")]
interface FileProcessingActivities
{
    public function upload(string $bucketName, string $localName, string $targetName);

    #[ActivityMethod("transcode_file")]
    public function download(string $bucketName, string $remoteName);

    public function processFile(): string;

    public function deleteLocalFile(string $fileName);
}
```

The `#[YourActivityInterface("file_activities.")]` is an annotation that tells the PHP SDK to generate a class to implement the `FileProcessingActivities` interface. The functions define Activities that are used in the Workflow.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

You can customize the Activity name with a custom name in the decorator argument. For example, `@activity.defn(name="your-activity")`. If the name parameter is not specified, the Activity name defaults to the function name.

```python
@activity.defn(name="your-activity")
async def your_activity(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

You can customize the name of the Activity when you register it with the Worker.
In the following example, the Activity Name is `activityFoo`.

The call to spawn an Activity Execution generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands/#scheduleactivitytask) Command.
This results in the set of three <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task">Activity Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task contains the context needed to make an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a> related Events ([ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events/#activitytaskscheduled), [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events/#activitytaskstarted), and ActivityTask[Closed])in your Workflow Execution Event History.

A single instance of the Activities implementation is shared across multiple simultaneous Activity invocations.
Therefore, the Activity implementation code must be _stateless_.

The values passed to Activities through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the Execution history.
The entire Execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow Workers when a Workflow state needs to recover.
A large Execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.

Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data you transfer through Activity invocation parameters or Return Values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.

The API is available from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/workflow) package.

The `ExecuteActivity()` API call requires an instance of `workflow.Context`, the Activity function name, and any variables to be passed to the Activity Execution.

```go
import (
  // ...

  "go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
  yourActivityParam := YourActivityParam{
    // ...
  }
  var activities *YourActivityStruct
  future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, activities.YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
  // ...
}

func (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) error {
  // ...
}
```

The Activity function name can be provided as a variable object (no quotations) or as a string.

```go
// ...
  future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, "YourActivityDefinition", yourActivityParam)
// ...
```

The benefit of passing the actual function object is that the framework can validate the parameters against the Activity Definition.

The `ExecuteActivity` call returns a Future, which can be used to get the result of the Activity Execution.

Activities are remote procedure calls that must be invoked from within a Workflow using `ActivityStub`.
Activities are not executable on their own. You cannot start an Activity Execution by itself.

Note that before an Activity Execution is invoked:

- Activity options (either <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout"> `setStartToCloseTimeout`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout"> `ScheduleToCloseTimeout`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule-To-Close Timeout is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall Activity Execution, from when the first Activity Task is scheduled to when the last Activity Task, in the chain of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution, reaches a Closed status.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> are required) must be set for the Activity.
  For details, see [Set Activity Options](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/java/how-to-set-activityoptions-in-java) and [Activity Options reference](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/java/reference-activityoptions).
- The Activity must be registered with a Worker.
  See <a class="tdlp" href="#run-worker-processes">Worker Program<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to develop a Worker Program in Java</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Use the `newWorker` method on an instance of a `WorkerFactory` to create a new Worker in Java.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#run-worker-processes">Learn more</a></span></span></a>
- Activity code must be thread-safe.

Activities should only be instantiated using stubs from within a Workflow.
An `ActivityStub` returns a client-side stub that implements an Activity interface.
You can invoke Activities using `Workflow.newActivityStub`(type-safe) or `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub` (untyped).

Calling a method on the Activity interface schedules the Activity invocation with the Temporal service, and generates an <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#activitytaskscheduled"> `ActivityTaskScheduled` Event<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Event?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Events are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to external occurrences and Commands generated by a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#activitytaskscheduled">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Activities can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously.

**Invoking Activities Synchronously**

In the following example, we use the type-safe `Workflow.newActivityStub` within the "FileProcessingWorkflow" Workflow implementation to create a client-side stub of the `FileProcessingActivities` class. We also define `ActivityOptions` and set `setStartToCloseTimeout` option to one hour.

```java
public class FileProcessingWorkflowImpl implements FileProcessingWorkflow {

    private final FileProcessingActivities activities;

    public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {
        this.activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(
                FileProcessingActivities.class,
                ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofHours(1))
                        .build());
    }

    @Override
    public void processFile(Arguments args) {
        String localName = null;
        String processedName = null;
        try {
            localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());
            processedName = activities.processFile(localName);
            activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);
        } finally {
            if (localName != null) {
                activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);
            }
            if (processedName != null) {
                activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);
            }
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

A Workflow can have multiple Activity stubs. Each Activity stub can have its own `ActivityOptions` defined.
The following example shows a Workflow implementation with two typed Activity stubs.

```java
public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {
    ActivityOptions options1 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
             .setTaskQueue("taskQueue1")
             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(10))
             .build();
    this.store1 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options1);

    ActivityOptions options2 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
             .setTaskQueue("taskQueue2")
             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
             .build();
    this.store2 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options2);
}
```

To invoke Activities inside Workflows without referencing the interface it implements, use an untyped Activity stub `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub`.
This is useful when the Activity type is not known at compile time, or to invoke Activities implemented in different programming languages.

```java
   // Workflow code
    ActivityOptions activityOptions =
        ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3))
        .setTaskQueue("simple-queue-node")
        .build();

    ActivityStub activity = Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub(activityOptions);
    activity.execute("ComposeGreeting", String.class, "Hello World" , "Spanish");
```

**Invoking Activities Asynchronously**

Sometimes Workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.
The Temporal Java SDK provides the `Async` class which includes static methods used to invoke any Activity asynchronously.
The calls return a result of type `Promise` which is similar to the Java `Future` and `CompletionStage`.
When invoking Activities, use `Async.function` for Activities that return a result, and `Async.procedure` for Activities that return void.

In the following asynchronous Activity invocation, the method reference is passed to `Async.function` followed by Activity arguments.

```java
Promise<String> localNamePromise = Async.function(activities::download, sourceBucket, sourceFile);
```

The following example shows how to call two Activity methods, "download" and "upload", in parallel on multiple files.

```java
  public void processFile(Arguments args) {
    List<Promise<String>> localNamePromises = new ArrayList<>();
    List<String> processedNames = null;
    try {
      // Download all files in parallel.
      for (String sourceFilename : args.getSourceFilenames()) {
        Promise<String> localName =
            Async.function(activities::download, args.getSourceBucketName(), sourceFilename);
        localNamePromises.add(localName);
      }
      List<String> localNames = new ArrayList<>();
      for (Promise<String> localName : localNamePromises) {
        localNames.add(localName.get());
      }
      processedNames = activities.processFiles(localNames);

      // Upload all results in parallel.
      List<Promise<Void>> uploadedList = new ArrayList<>();
      for (String processedName : processedNames) {
        Promise<Void> uploaded =
            Async.procedure(
                activities::upload,
                args.getTargetBucketName(),
                args.getTargetFilename(),
                processedName);
        uploadedList.add(uploaded);
      }
      // Wait for all uploads to complete.
      Promise.allOf(uploadedList).get();
    } finally {
      for (Promise<String> localNamePromise : localNamePromises) {
        // Skip files that haven't completed downloading.
        if (localNamePromise.isCompleted()) {
          activities.deleteLocalFile(localNamePromise.get());
        }
      }
      if (processedNames != null) {
        for (String processedName : processedNames) {
          activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

**Activity Execution Context**

`ActivityExecutionContext` is a context object passed to each Activity implementation by default.
You can access it in your Activity implementations via `Activity.getExecutionContext()`.

It provides getters to access information about the Workflow that invoked the Activity.
Note that the Activity context information is stored in a thread-local variable.
Therefore, calls to `getExecutionContext()` succeed only within the thread that invoked the Activity function.

Following is an example of using the `ActivityExecutionContext`:

```java
public class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {

  @Override
  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {

    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();
    ActivityInfo info = ctx.getInfo();

    log.info("namespace=" +  info.getActivityNamespace());
    log.info("workflowId=" + info.getWorkflowId());
    log.info("runId=" + info.getRunId());
    log.info("activityId=" + info.getActivityId());
    log.info("activityTimeout=" + info.getStartToCloseTimeout();

    return downloadFileFromS3(bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);
  }
    ...
}
```

Activity implementation is an implementation of an Activity interface.
The following code example, uses a constructor that takes an Amazon S3 client and a local directory, and uploads a file to the S3 bucket.
Then, the code uses a function to download a file from the S3 bucket passing a bucket name, remote name, and local name as arguments.
Finally, it uses a function that takes a local file name as an argument and returns a string.

```php
// An implementation of an Activity interface.
class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {

    private S3Client $s3Client;

    private string $localDirectory;

    public function __construct(S3Client $s3Client, string $localDirectory) {
        $this->s3Client = $s3Client;
        $this->localDirectory = $localDirectory;
    }

    // Uploading a file to S3.
    public function upload(string $bucketName, string $localName, string $targetName): void
    {
        $this->s3Client->putObject(

            $remoteName,
            fopen($this->localDirectory .$localName, 'wb+')
        );
    }

// A function that takes a local file name as an argument and returns a string.
    public function processFile(string $localName): string
    {
        // Implementation omitted for brevity.
        return compressFile($this->localDirectory . $localName);
    }

    public function deleteLocalFile(string $fileName): void
    {
        unlink($this->localDirectory . $fileName);
    }

To spawn an Activity Execution, use the [`execute_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_activity) operation from within your Workflow Definition.

```python
@workflow.defn
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity, name, schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5)
        )
```

`execute_activity()` is a shortcut for [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) that waits on its result.

To get just the handle to wait and cancel separately, use `start_activity()`.
In most cases, use `execute_activity()` unless advanced task capabilities are needed.

A single argument to the Activity is positional. Multiple arguments are not supported in the type-safe form of `start_activity()` or `execute_activity()` and must be supplied by the `args` keyword argument.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

To spawn an Activity Execution, you must retrieve the _Activity handle_ in your Workflow.

```typescript
import { proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
// Only import the activity types
import type * as activities from './activities';

const { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',
});

// A workflow that calls an activity
export async function example(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return await greet(name);
}
```

This imports the individual Activities and declares the type alias for each Activity.

### Required timeout

Activity Execution semantics rely on several parameters.
The only required value that needs to be set is either a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Schedule-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Start-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
These values are set in the Activity Options.

Workflow Executions can either block progress until the result is available through the Awaitable or continue progressing, making use of the result when it becomes available.

The `ExecuteActivity` API call returns an instance of [`workflow.Future`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Futures) which has the following two methods:

- `Get()`: Takes an instance of the `workflow.Context`, that was passed to the Activity Execution, and a pointer as parameters.
  The variable associated with the pointer is populated with the Activity Execution result.
  This call blocks until the results are available.
- `IsReady()`: Returns `true` when the result of the Activity Execution is ready.

Call the `Get()` method on the instance of `workflow.Future` to get the result of the Activity Execution.
The type of the result parameter must match the type of the return value declared by the Activity function.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
 // ...
 future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
 var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
 if err := future.Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult); err != nil {
   // ...
 }
 // ...
}
```

Use the `IsReady()` method first to make sure the `Get()` call doesn't cause the Workflow Execution to wait on the result.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
 // ...
 future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
 // ...
 if(future.IsReady()) {
   var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
   if err := future.Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult); err != nil {
     // ...
   }
 }
 // ...
}
```

It is idiomatic to invoke multiple Activity Executions from within a Workflow.
Therefore, it is also idiomatic to either block on the results of the Activity Executions or continue on to execute additional logic, checking for the Activity Execution results at a later time.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

To get the results of an asynchronously invoked Activity method, use the `Promise` `get` method to block until the Activity method result is available.

Sometimes an Activity Execution lifecycle goes beyond a synchronous method invocation.
For example, a request can be put in a queue and later a reply comes and is picked up by a different Worker process.
The whole request-reply interaction can be modeled as a single Activity.

To indicate that an Activity should not be completed upon its method return, call `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()` from the original Activity thread.

Then later, when replies come, complete the Activity using the `ActivityCompletionClient`.
To correlate Activity invocation with completion, use either a `TaskToken` or Workflow and Activity Ids.

Following is an example of using `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()`:

```java
public class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {

  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {

    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();

    // Used to correlate reply
    byte[] taskToken = ctx.getInfo().getTaskToken();

    asyncDownloadFileFromS3(taskToken, bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);
    ctx.doNotCompleteOnReturn();

    // Return value is ignored when doNotCompleteOnReturn was called.
    return "ignored";
  }
  ...
}
```

When the download is complete, the download service potentially can complete the Activity, or fail it from a different process, for example:

```java
  public <R> void completeActivity(byte[] taskToken, R result) {
    completionClient.complete(taskToken, result);
  }

  public void failActivity(byte[] taskToken, Exception failure) {
    completionClient.completeExceptionally(taskToken, failure);
  }
```

`Workflow::newActivityStub`returns a client-side stub an implements an Activity interface. The client-side stub can be used within the Workflow code. It takes the Activity's type and`ActivityOptions` as arguments.

Calling (via `yield`) a method on this interface invokes an Activity that implements this method.
An Activity invocation synchronously blocks until the Activity completes, fails, or times out.
Even if Activity Execution takes a few months, the Workflow code still sees it as a single synchronous invocation.
It doesn't matter what happens to the processes that host the Workflow.
The business logic code just sees a single method call.

```php
class GreetingWorkflow implements GreetingWorkflowInterface
{
    private $greetingActivity;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
            GreetingActivityInterface::class,
            ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 seconds'))
        );
    }

    public function greet(string $name): \Generator
    {
        // This is a blocking call that returns only after the activity has completed.
        return yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hello', $name);
    }
}
```

If different Activities need different options, like timeouts or a task queue, multiple client-side stubs can be created with different options.

```php
$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 seconds'))
);

$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 minutes'))
);

Use [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) to start an Activity and return its handle, [`ActivityHandle`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.ActivityHandle.html). Use [`execute_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_activity) to return the results.

You must provide either `schedule_to_close_timeout` or `start_to_close_timeout`.

`execute_activity()` is a shortcut for `await start_activity()`. An asynchronous `execute_activity()` helper is provided which takes the same arguments as `start_activity()` and `await`s on the result. `execute_activity()` should be used in most cases unless advanced task capabilities are needed.

The `proxyActivities()` returns an object that calls the Activities in the function. `acts[activityName]()` references the Activity using the Activity name, then it returns the results.

Although multiple Worker Entities can be in a single Worker Process, a single Worker Entity Worker Process may be perfectly sufficient.
For more information, see the [Worker tuning guide](/application-development/worker-performance).

A Worker Entity contains both a Workflow Worker and an Activity Worker so that it can make progress for either a Workflow Execution or an Activity Execution.

Create an instance of [`Worker`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#Worker) by calling [`worker.New()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#New), available through the `go.temporal.io/sdk/worker` package, and pass it the following parameters:

1. An instance of the Temporal Go SDK `Client`.
1. The name of the Task Queue that it will poll.
1. An instance of `worker.Options`, which can be empty.

Then, register the Workflow Types and the Activity Types that the Worker will be capable of executing.

Lastly, call either the `Start()` or the `Run()` method on the instance of the Worker.
Run accepts an interrupt channel as a parameter, so that the Worker can be stopped in the terminal.
Otherwise, the `Stop()` method must be called to stop the Worker.

```go
package main

import (
   "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
   "go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
)

func main() {
   c, err := client.Dial(client.Options{})
   if err != nil {
       // ...
   }
   defer c.Close()
   w := worker.New(c, "your-task-queue", worker.Options{})
   w.RegisterWorkflow(YourWorkflowDefinition)
   w.RegisterActivity(YourActivityDefinition)
   err = w.Run(worker.InterruptCh())

If you have [`gow`](https://github.com/mitranim/gow) installed, the Worker Process automatically "reloads" when you update the Worker file:

Use the `newWorker` method on an instance of a [`WorkerFactory`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/worker/WorkerFactory.html) to create a new Worker in Java.

A single Worker Entity can contain many Worker Objects.
Call the `start()` method on the instance of the `WorkerFactory` to start all the Workers created in this process.

```java
// ...
import io.temporal.client.WorkflowClient;
import io.temporal.serviceclient.WorkflowServiceStubs;
import io.temporal.worker.Worker;
import io.temporal.worker.WorkerFactory;

public class YourWorker {

    WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
    WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);
    Worker yourWorker = factory.newWorker("your_task_queue");

    // Register Workflow
    // and/or register Activities

    factory.start();
  }
}
```

After creating the Worker entity, register all Workflow Types and all Activity Types that the Worker can execute.
A Worker can be registered with just Workflows, just Activities, or both.

<TabItem value="php">

The [RoadRunner application server](https://roadrunner.dev/) will launch multiple Temporal PHP Worker processes based on provided `.rr.yaml` configuration.

Each Worker might connect to one or multiple Task Queues.
Worker poll _Temporal service_ for tasks, performs those tasks, and communicates task execution results back to the _Temporal service_.

Worker code are developed, deployed, and operated by Temporal customers.
To create a worker use `Temporal\WorkerFactory`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Temporal\WorkerFactory;

ini_set('display_errors', 'stderr');
include "vendor/autoload.php";

// factory initiates and runs task queue specific activity and workflow workers
$factory = WorkerFactory::create();

// Worker that listens on a Task Queue and hosts both workflow and activity implementations.
$worker = $factory->newWorker();

// Workflows are stateful. So you need a type to create instances.
$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(App\DemoWorkflow::class);

// Activities are stateless and thread safe. So a shared instance is used.
$worker->registerActivity(App\DemoActivity::class);

// In case an activity class requires some external dependencies provide a callback - factory
// that creates or builds a new activity instance. The factory should be a callable which accepts
// an instance of ReflectionClass with an activity class which should be created.
$worker->registerActivity(App\DemoActivity::class, fn(ReflectionClass $class) => $container->create($class->getName()));

// start primary loop
$factory->run();
```

You can configure task queue name using first argument of `WorkerFactory`->`newWorker`:

```php
$worker = $factory->newWorker('your-task-queue');
```

As mentioned above you can create as many Task Queue connections inside a single Worker Process as you need.

To configure additional WorkerOptions use `Temporal\Worker\WorkerOptions`:

```php
use Temporal\Worker\WorkerOptions;

$worker = $factory->newWorker(
    'your-task-queue',
    WorkerOptions::new()
        ->withMaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPollers(10)
);
```

Make sure to point the Worker file in application server configuration:

```yaml
rpc:
  listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:6001

server:
  command: "php worker.php"

temporal:
  address: "temporal:7233"
  activities:
    num_workers: 10
```

> You can serve HTTP endpoints using the same server setup.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

To develop a Worker, use the [`Worker()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.Worker.html#__init__) constructor and add your Client, Task Queue, Workflows, and Activities as arguments.

The following code example creates a Worker that polls for tasks from the Task Queue and executes the Workflow.

```python
worker = Worker(
    client,
    task_queue="your-task-queue",
    workflows=[YourWorkflow],
    activities=[your_activity],
)
```

The following code example shows a Worker hosting Workflows and Activities.

```python
async def run_worker(stop_event: asyncio.Event):
    # Create Client connected to server at the given address
    client = await Client.connect("127.0.0.1:7233", namespace="your-custom-namespace")

    # Run the worker until the event is set
    worker = Worker(
        client,
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        workflows=[YourWorkflow],
        activities=[your_activity],
    )
    async with worker:
        await stop_event.wait()
```

The `asyncio.Event` that will be set when the Worker should stop.
Although this example accepts a stop event and uses `async with`, you can also use [`run()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.Worker.html#run) and [`shutdown()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.Worker.html#shutdown).
The `shutdown()` operation waits on all Activities to complete, so if a long-running Activity does not at least respect cancellation, the shutdown might never complete.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

Create a Worker with `Worker.create()` (which establishes the initial gRPC connection), then call `worker.run()` on it (to start polling the Task Queue).

Below is an example of starting a Worker that polls the Task Queue named `tutorial`.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-hello-worker {"enable_source_link": false}-->

```ts
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as activities from './activities';

async function run() {
  // Step 1: Register Workflows and Activities with the Worker and connect to
  // the Temporal server.
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    activities,
    taskQueue: 'hello-world',
  });
  // Worker connects to localhost by default and uses console.error for logging.
  // Customize the Worker by passing more options to create():
  // https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker
  // If you need to configure server connection parameters, see docs:
  // https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/security#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls

  // Step 2: Start accepting tasks on the `hello-world` queue
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

`taskQueue` is the only required option, but you will also use `workflowsPath` and `activities` to register Workflows and Activities with the Worker.

A full example for Workers looks like this:

```typescript
import { NativeConnection, Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as activities from './activities';

async function run() {
  const connection = await NativeConnection.connect({
    // defaults port to 7233 if not specified
    address: 'foo.bar.tmprl.cloud',
    tls: {
      // set to true if TLS without mTLS
      // See docs for other TLS options
      clientCertPair: {
        crt: clientCert,
        key: clientKey,
      },
    },
  });

  const worker = await Worker.create({
    connection,
    namespace: 'foo.bar', // as explained in Namespaces section
    // ...
  });
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

See below for more Worker options.

**Workflow and Activity registration**

Workers bundle Workflow code and `node_modules` using Webpack v5 and execute them inside V8 isolates.
Activities are directly required and run by Workers in the Node.js environment.

Workers are very flexible – you can host any or all of your Workflows and Activities on a Worker, and you can host multiple Workers in a single machine.

There are three main things the Worker needs:

- `taskQueue`: the Task Queue to poll. This is the only required argument.
- `activities`: Optional. Imported and supplied directly to the Worker. Not the path.
- Workflow bundle:
- Either specify a `workflowsPath` to your `workflows.ts` file to pass to Webpack, e.g., `require.resolve('./workflows')`. Workflows will be bundled with their dependencies.
- Or pass a prebuilt bundle to `workflowBundle` instead if you prefer to handle the bundling yourself.

**Additional Worker Options**

This is a selected subset of options you are likely to use. Even more advanced options, particularly for performance tuning, are available in [the API reference](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions).

| Options         | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dataConverter` | Encodes and decodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Server. Supports `undefined`, `UintBArray`, and JSON.                                                                     |
| `sinks`         | Allows injection of Workflow Sinks (Advanced feature: see [Logging docs](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/logging))                                        |
| `interceptors`  | A mapping of interceptor type to a list of factories or module paths (Advanced feature: see [Interceptors](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/interceptors)) |

### Register types

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it fails that Task.
However, the failure of the Task does not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

<Tabs
defaultValue="go"
queryString="lang"
values={[{label: 'Go', value: 'go'},{label: 'Java', value: 'java'},{label: 'PHP', value: 'php'},{label: 'Python', value: 'python'},{label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},]}>

<TabItem value="go">

The `RegisterWorkflow()` and `RegisterActivity()` calls essentially create an in-memory mapping between the Workflow Types and their implementations, inside the Worker process.

**Registering Activity `structs`**

Per <a class="tdlp" href="#develop-activities">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to develop an Activity Definition in Go</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity Definition is an exportable function or `stuct` method.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#develop-activities">Learn more</a></span></span></a> best practices, you might have an Activity struct that has multiple methods and fields.
When you use `RegisterActivity()` for an Activity struct, that Worker has access to all exported methods.

**Registering multiple Types**

To register multiple Activity Types and/or Workflow Types with the Worker Entity, just make multiple Activity registration calls, but make sure each Type name is unique:

```go
w.RegisterActivity(ActivityA)
w.RegisterActivity(ActivityB)
w.RegisterActivity(ActivityC)
w.RegisterWorkflow(WorkflowA)
w.RegisterWorkflow(WorkflowB)
w.RegisterWorkflow(WorkflowC)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

Use `worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes` to register Workflow Type and `worker.registerActivitiesImplementations` to register Activity implementation with Workers.

For Workflows, the Workflow Type is registered with a Worker.
A Workflow Type can be registered only once per Worker entity.
If you define multiple Workflow implementations of the same type, you get an exception at the time of registration.

For Activities, Activity implementation instances are registered with a Worker because they are stateless and thread-safe.
You can pass any number of dependencies in the Activity implementation constructor, such as the database connections, services, etc.

The following example shows how to register a Workflow and an Activity with a Worker.

```java
Worker worker = workerFactory.newWorker("your_task_queue");
...
// Register Workflow
worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(GreetingWorkflowImpl.class);
// Register Activity
worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new GreetingActivitiesImpl());
```

When you register a single instance of an Activity, you can have multiple instances of Workflow Executions calling the same Activity.
Activity code must be thread-safe because the same instance of the Activity code is run for every Workflow Execution that calls it.

For `DynamicWorkflow`, only one Workflow implementation that extends `DynamicWorkflow` can be registered with a Worker.
The following example shows how to register the `DynamicWorkflow` and `DynamicActivity` implementation with a Worker.

```java
  public static void main(String[] arg) {

    WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newInstance();
    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
    WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);
    Worker worker = factory.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE);

    /* Register the Dynamic Workflow implementation with the Worker. Workflow implementations
    ** must be known to the Worker at runtime to dispatch Workflow Tasks.
    */
    worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(DynamicGreetingWorkflowImpl.class);

    // Start all the Workers that are in this process.
    factory.start();

    /* Create the Workflow stub. Note that the Workflow Type is not explicitly registered with the Worker. */
    WorkflowOptions workflowOptions =
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).setWorkflowId(WORKFLOW_ID).build();
    WorkflowStub workflow = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub("DynamicWF", workflowOptions);
    /**
     * Register Dynamic Activity implementation with the Worker. Since Activities are stateless
     * and thread-safe, we need to register a shared instance.
    */
    worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new DynamicGreetingActivityImpl());

    /* Start Workflow Execution and immmediately send Signal. Pass in the Workflow args and Signal args. */
    workflow.signalWithStart("greetingSignal", new Object[] {"John"}, new Object[] {"Hello"});

    // Wait for the Workflow to finish getting the results.
    String result = workflow.getResult(String.class);

    System.out.println(result);

    System.exit(0);
  }
}
```

You can register multiple type-specific Workflow implementations alongside a single `DynamicWorkflow` implementation.
You can register only one Activity instance that implements `DynamicActivity` with a Worker.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

Worker listens on a Task Queue and hosts both Workflow and Activity implementations:

```php
// Workflows are stateful. So you need a type to create instances:
$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(App\DemoWorkflow::class);
// Activities are stateless and thread safe:
$worker->registerActivity(App\DemoActivity::class);
```

In case an activity class requires some external dependencies provide a callback - factory
that creates or builds a new activity instance. The factory should be a callable which accepts
an instance of ReflectionClass with an activity class which should be created.

```php
$worker->registerActivity(
    App\DemoActivity::class,
    fn(ReflectionClass $class) => $container->create($class->getName())
);
```

If you want to clean up some resources after activity is done, you may register a finalizer. This callback is called
after each activity invocation:

```php
$worker->registerActivityFinalizer(fn() => $kernel->showtdown());
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

When a `Worker` is created, it accepts a list of Workflows in the `workflows` parameter, a list of Activities in the `activities` parameter, or both.

```python
worker = Worker(
    client,
    task_queue="your-task-queue",
    workflows=[YourWorkflow1, YourWorkflow2],
    activities=[your_activity_1, your_activity_2],
)

In development, use [`workflowsPath`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions/#workflowspath):

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-worker-create -->

[snippets/src/worker.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/snippets/src/worker.ts)

```ts
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';

async function run() {
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    taskQueue: 'snippets',
    activities,
  });

  await worker.run();
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

In this snippet, the Worker bundles the Workflow code at runtime.

In production, you can improve your Worker's startup time by bundling in advance: as part of your production build, call [`bundleWorkflowCode`](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/workers#prebuilt-workflow-bundles):

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-bundle-workflow -->

[production/src/scripts/build-workflow-bundle.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/production/src/scripts/build-workflow-bundle.ts)

```ts

import { writeFile } from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';

async function bundle() {
  const { code } = await bundleWorkflowCode({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('../workflows'),
  });
  const codePath = path.join(__dirname, '../../workflow-bundle.js');

  await writeFile(codePath, code);
  console.log(`Bundle written to ${codePath}`);
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

Then the bundle can be passed to the Worker:

## Start Workflow Execution

[Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) semantics rely on several parameters—that is, to start a Workflow Execution you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type, language-specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

In the examples below, all Workflow Executions are started using a Temporal Client.
To spawn Workflow Executions from within another Workflow Execution, use either the [Child Workflow](#child-workflows) or External Workflow APIs.

See the [Customize Workflow Type](#customize-workflow-type) section to see how to customize the name of the Workflow Type.

A request to spawn a Workflow Execution causes the Temporal Cluster to create the first Event ([WorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events/#workflowexecutionstarted)) in the Workflow Execution Event History.
The Temporal Cluster then creates the first Workflow Task, resulting in the first [WorkflowTaskScheduled](/references/events/#workflowtaskscheduled) Event.

<TabItem value="go">

To spawn a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution), use the `ExecuteWorkflow()` method on the Go SDK [`Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client).

The `ExecuteWorkflow()` API call requires an instance of [`context.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context), an instance of [`StartWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#StartWorkflowOptions), a Workflow Type name, and all variables to be passed to the Workflow Execution.
The `ExecuteWorkflow()` call returns a Future, which can be used to get the result of the Workflow Execution.

```go
package main

import (
  // ...

  "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)

func main() {
  temporalClient, err := client.Dial(client.Options{})
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  defer temporalClient.Close()
  // ...
  workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
    // ...
  }
  workflowRun, err := temporalClient.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
}
```

If the invocation process has access to the function directly, then the Workflow Type name parameter can be passed as if the function name were a variable, without quotations.

```go
workflowRun, err := temporalClient.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
```

If the invocation process does not have direct access to the statically defined Workflow Definition, for example, if the Workflow Definition is in an un-importable package, or it is written in a completely different language, then the Workflow Type can be provided as a `string`.

```go
workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, "YourWorkflowDefinition", param)
```

<TabItem value="java">

Use `WorkflowStub` to start a Workflow Execution from within a Client, and `ExternalWorkflowStub` to start a different Workflow Execution from within a Workflow.

See <a class="tdlp" href="/application-development/features#signal-with-start"> `SignalwithStart`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to send a Signal-with-Start in Java</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To send Signals to a Workflow Execution whose status is unknown, use `SignalWithStart` with a `WorkflowStub` in the Client code.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/application-development/features#signal-with-start">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to start a Workflow Execution to receive a Signal from within another Workflow.

**Using `WorkflowStub`**

`WorkflowStub` is a proxy generated by the `WorkflowClient`.
Each time a new Workflow Execution is started, an instance of the Workflow implementation object is created.
Then, one of the methods (depending on the Workflow Type of the instance) annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can be invoked.
As soon as this method returns, the Workflow Execution is considered to be complete.

You can use a typed or untyped `WorkflowStub` in the client code.

- Typed `WorkflowStub` are useful because they are type safe and allow you to invoke your Workflow methods such as `@WorkflowMethod`, `@QueryMethod`, and `@SignalMethod` directly.
- An untyped `WorkflowStub` does not use the Workflow interface, and is not type safe. It is more flexible because it has methods from the `WorkflowStub` interface, such as `start`, `signalWithStart`, `getResults` (sync and async), `query`, `signal`, `cancel` and `terminate`.
  Note that the Temporal Java SDK also provides typed `WorkflowStub` versions for these methods.
  When using untyped `WorkflowStub`, we rely on the Workflow Type, Activity Type, Child Workflow Type, as well as Query and Signal names.
  For details, see <a class="tdlp" href="#connect-to-a-cluster">Temporal Client<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create a Temporal Client in Java</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To initialize a Workflow Client, create an instance of a `WorkflowClient`, create a client-side `WorkflowStub`, and then call a Workflow method (annotated with the `@WorkflowMethod` annotation).</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#connect-to-a-cluster">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

A Workflow Execution can be started either synchronously or asynchronously.

- Synchronous invocation starts a Workflow and then waits for its completion. If the process that started the Workflow crashes or stops waiting, the Workflow continues executing.
  Because Workflows are potentially long-running, and Client crashes happen, it is not very commonly found in production use.
  The following example is a type-safe approach for starting a Workflow Execution synchronously.

  ```java
    NotifyUserAccounts workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(
          NotifyUserAccounts.class,
          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                  .setWorkflowId("notifyAccounts")
                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                  .build()
          );

  // start the Workflow and wait for a result.
    workflow.notify(new String[] { "Account1", "Account2", "Account3", "Account4", "Account5",
                  "Account6", "Account7", "Account8", "Account9", "Account10"});
      }
  // notify(String[] accountIds) is a Workflow method defined in the Workflow Definition.
  ```

- Asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller. This is the most common way to start Workflows in production code.
  The `WorkflowClient` <https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClient.java)> provides some static methods, such as `start`, `execute`, `signalWithStart` etc., that help with starting your Workflows asynchronously.

  The following examples show how to start Workflow Executions asynchronously, with either typed or untyped `WorkflowStub`.

  - **Typed WorkflowStub Example**

    ```java
    // create typed Workflow stub
    FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(FileProcessingWorkflow.class,
          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                  .build());
    // use WorkflowClient.execute to return future that contains Workflow result or failure, or
    // use WorkflowClient.start to return WorkflowId and RunId of the started Workflow).
    WorkflowClient.start(workflow::greetCustomer);
    ```

  - **Untyped WorkflowStub Example**

    ```java
    WorkflowStub untyped = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub("FileProcessingWorkflow",
          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                  .build());

    // blocks until Workflow Execution has been started (not until it completes)
    untyped.start(argument);
    ```

You can call a Dynamic Workflow implementation using an untyped `WorkflowStub`.
The following example shows how to call the Dynamic Workflow implementation in the Client code.

```java
    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
    /**
      * Note that for this part of the client code, the dynamic Workflow implementation must
      * be known to the Worker at runtime in order to dispatch Workflow tasks, and may be defined
      * in the Worker definition as:*/
    // worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(DynamicGreetingWorkflowImpl.class);

    /* Create the Workflow stub to call the dynamic Workflow.
    * Note that the Workflow Type is not explicitly registered with the Worker.*/
    WorkflowOptions workflowOptions =
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).setWorkflowId(WORKFLOW_ID).build();
    WorkflowStub workflow = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub("DynamicWF", workflowOptions);
```

`DynamicWorkflow` can be used to invoke different Workflow Types.
To check what type is running when your Dynamic Workflow `execute` method runs, use `getWorkflowType()` in the implementation code.

```java
String type = Workflow.getInfo().getWorkflowType();
```

**Using `ExternalWorkflowStub`**

Use `ExternalWorkflowStub` within a Workflow to invoke, and send Signals to, other Workflows by type.

This helps particularly for executing Workflows written in other language SDKs, as shown in the following example.

```java
@Override
  public String yourWFMethod(String name) {
      ExternalWorkflowStub callOtherWorkflow = Workflow.newUntypedExternalWorkflowStub("OtherWFId");
    }
```

See the [Temporal Polyglot](https://github.com/tsurdilo/temporal-polyglot) code for examples of executing Workflows written in other language SDKs.

**Recurring start**

You can start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule by using <a class="tdlp" href="/application-development/features#temporal-cron-jobs"> `setCronSchedule`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to set a Cron Schedule in Java</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Set the Cron Schedule with the `WorkflowStub` instance in the Client code using [`WorkflowOptions.Builder.setCronSchedule`</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/application-development/features#temporal-cron-jobs">Learn more</a></span></span></a> Workflow option in the Client code.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

Workflows can be started both synchronously and asynchronously.
You can use typed or untyped Workflows stubs available via `Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient`.
To create a Workflow Client:

```php
use Temporal\Client\GRPC\ServiceClient;
use Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient;

$workflowClient = WorkflowClient::create(ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233'));
```

**Synchronous start**

A synchronous start initiates a Workflow and then waits for its completion. The started Workflow will not rely on the
invocation process and will continue executing even if the waiting process crashes or stops.

Be sure to acquire the Workflow interface or class name you want to start.
For example:

```php
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface AccountTransferWorkflowInterface
{
    #[WorkflowMethod(name: "MoneyTransfer")]
    #[ReturnType('int')]
    public function transfer(
        string $fromAccountId,
        string $toAccountId,
        string $referenceId,
        int $amountCents
    );
}
```

To start the Workflow in sync mode:

```php
$accountTransfer = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class
);

$result = $accountTransfer->transfer(
    'fromID',
    'toID',
    'refID',
    1000
);
```

**Asynchronous start**

An asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller without waiting for a result.
This is the most common way to start Workflows in a live environment.

To start a Workflow asynchronously, pass the Workflow stub instance and start parameters into the `WorkflowClient`->`start` method.

```php
$accountTransfer = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    AccountTransferWorkflowInterface::class
);

$run = $this->workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);
```

After the Workflow is started, you can receive the Workflow Id via the `WorkflowRun` object returned by the `start` method:

```php
$run = $workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);

var_dump($run->getExecution()->getID());
```

<TabItem value="python">

To start a Workflow Execution in Python, use either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods in the Client.

The following code example starts a Workflow and returns its handle.

```python
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("127.0.0.1:7233", namespace="your-custom-namespace")

    handle = await client.start_workflow(
        "your-workflow-name",
        "some arg",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
    )
```

The following code example starts a Workflow and waits for completion.

```python
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("127.0.0.1:7233", namespace="your-custom-namespace")

    handle = await client.execute_workflow(
        "your-workflow-name",
        "some arg",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
    )
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

When you have a Workflow Client, you can schedule the start of a Workflow with `client.start()`, specifying `workflowId`, `taskQueue`, and `args` and returning a Workflow handle immediately after the Server acknowledges the receipt.

```typescript
const handle = await client.start(example, {
  workflowId: 'your-workflow-id',
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
  args: ['argument01', 'argument02', 'argument03'], // this is typechecked against workflowFn's args
});
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
const result = await handle.result();
```

Calling `client.start()` and `client.execute()` send a command to Temporal Server to schedule a new Workflow Execution on the specified Task Queue. It does not actually start until a Worker that has a matching Workflow Type, polling that Task Queue, picks it up.

You can test this by executing a Workflow Client command without a matching Worker. Temporal Server records the command in Event History, but does not make progress with the Workflow Execution until a Worker starts polling with a matching Task Queue and Workflow Definition.

Workflow Execution run in a separate V8 isolate context in order to provide a [deterministic runtime](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/typescript/determinism).

<TabItem value="php">

In PHP, a Task Queue is represented in code by its name as a `string`.
There are four places where the name of the Task Queue is supplied by the developer.

1. When starting a Workflow, a Task Queue name must be provided in the `StartWorkflowOptions`.

```php
// Create new Workflow Options and set the Task Queue
$workflowOptions = WorkflowOptions::new()
  ->withTaskQueue("Workflow-Task-Queue-1")
  // ...

$yourWorkflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
  YourWorkflowInterface::class,
  $workflowOptions
);

$result = $yourWorkflow->workflowMethod();
```

2. A Task Queue name must be provided as a parameter when creating a Worker.

```php
use Temporal\WorkerFactory;

// Create a Worker Factory
$factory = WorkerFactory::create();

// Set the Task Queue when creating the Worker
$worker = $factory->newWorker("Workflow-Task-Queue-1");

// Workflows are stateful. So you need a type to create instances.
$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(YourWorkflow::class);

// start primary loop
$factory->run();
```

A single Worker can listen to only one Task Queue.
And, it is important to remember that the name of the Task Queue the Worker is listening to must match the name of the Task Queue provided in the options to any given Workflow or Activity.

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it will fail that Task.
However, the failure of the Task will not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

3. Optionally, the name of a Task Queue can be provided in the `ActivityOptions` when calling an Activity from a Workflow.

```php
class YourWorkflow implements YourWorkflowInterface
{
  private $yourActivity;

  public function __construct()
  {
    // Create Activity options and set the Task Queue
    $activityOptions = ActivityOptions::new()
      ->withTaskQueue("Activity-Task-Queue-1")
      // ...

    // Create a new Activity Stub and pass the options
    $this->yourActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
      YourActivityInterface::class,
      $activityOptions
    );
  }

  public function workflowMethod(): \Generator
  {
    // Call the Activity
    return yield $this->yourActivity->activityMethod();
  }
}
```

If a Task Queue name is not provided in the `ActivityOptions`, then the Activity Tasks are placed in the same Task Queue as the Workflow Task Queue.

4. Optionally, the name of a Task Queue can be provided in the `ChildWorkflowOptions` when calling a Child Workflow.

```php
//Create new Child Workflow Options and set the Task Queue
$childWorkflowOptions = ChildWorkflowOptions::new()
    ->withTaskQueue("Child-Workflow-Task-Queue-1")
    // ...

// Create a new Child Workflow Stub and set the Task Queue
$childWorkflow = Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub(
    ChildWorkflowInterface::class,
    $childWorkflowOptions
);

// Call the Child Workflow method
$promise = $childWorkflow->workflowMethod();
```

If a Task Queue name is not provided in the `ChildWorkflowOptions`, then the Child Workflow Tasks are placed in the same Task Queue as the Parent Workflow Task Queue.

<TabItem value="python">

To set a Task Queue in Python, specify the `task_queue` argument when executing a Workflow with either [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) methods.

```python

<TabItem value="typescript">

A Task Queue is a dynamic queue in Temporal polled by one or more Workers.

Workers bundle Workflow code and node modules using Webpack v5 and execute them inside V8 isolates. Activities are directly required and run by Workers in the Node.js environment.

Workers are flexible. You can host any or all of your Workflows and Activities on a Worker, and you can host multiple Workers on a single machine.

There are three main things the Worker needs:

- `taskQueue`: the Task Queue to poll. This is the only required argument.
- `activities`: Optional. Imported and supplied directly to the Worker.
- Workflow bundle, specify one of the following options:
  - a `workflowsPath` to your `workflows.ts` file to pass to Webpack. For example, `require.resolve('./workflows')`. Workflows will be bundled with their dependencies.
  - Or pass a prebuilt bundle to `workflowBundle`, if you prefer to handle the bundling yourself.

```ts
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as activities from './activities';

async function run() {
  // Step 1: Register Workflows and Activities with the Worker and connect to
  // the Temporal server.
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    activities,
    taskQueue: 'hello-world',
  });
  // Worker connects to localhost by default and uses console.error for logging.
  // Customize the Worker by passing more options to create():
  // https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker
  // If you need to configure server connection parameters, see docs:
  // /typescript/security#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls

  // Step 2: Start accepting tasks on the `tutorial` queue
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

`taskQueue` is the only required option; however, use `workflowsPath` and `activities` to register Workflows and Activities with the Worker.

When scheduling a Workflow, a `taskQueue` must be specified.

```ts
import { Connection, WorkflowClient } from '@temporalio/client';
// This is the code that is used to start a workflow.
const connection = await Connection.create();
const client = new WorkflowClient({ connection });
const result = await client.execute(yourWorkflow, {
  // required
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
  // required
  workflowId: 'your-workflow-id',
});
```

When creating a Worker, you must pass the `taskQueue` option to the `Worker.create()` function.

```ts
const worker = await Worker.create({
  // imported elsewhere
  activities,
  taskQueue: 'your-task-queue',
});
```

Optionally, in Workflow code, when calling an Activity, you can specify the Task Queue by passing the `taskQueue` option to `proxyActivities()`, `startChild()`, or `executeChild()`. If you do not specify a `taskQueue`, then the TypeScript SDK places Activity and Child Workflow Tasks in the same Task Queue as the Workflow Task Queue.

### Get Workflow results

If the call to start a Workflow Execution is successful, you will gain access to the Workflow Execution's Run Id.

The Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace may be used to uniquely identify a Workflow Execution in the system and get its result.

It's possible to both block progress on the result (synchronous execution) or get the result at some other point in time (asynchronous execution).

In the Temporal Platform, it's also acceptable to use Queries as the preferred method for accessing the state and results of Workflow Executions.

<Tabs

<TabItem value="go">

The `ExecuteWorkflow` call returns an instance of [`WorkflowRun`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#WorkflowRun), which is the `workflowRun` variable in the following line.

```go
 workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, app.YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
 if err != nil {
   // ...
 }
 // ...
}
```

The instance of `WorkflowRun` has the following three methods:

- `GetWorkflowID()`: Returns the Workflow Id of the invoked Workflow Execution.
- `GetRunID()`: Always returns the Run Id of the initial Run (See [Continue As New](#)) in the series of Runs that make up the full Workflow Execution.
- `Get`: Takes a pointer as a parameter and populates the associated variable with the Workflow Execution result.

To wait on the result of Workflow Execution in the same process that invoked it, call `Get()` on the instance of `WorkflowRun` that is returned by the `ExecuteWorkflow()` call.

```go
 workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
 if err != nil {
   // ...
 }
 var result YourWorkflowResponse
 err = workflowRun.Get(context.Background(), &result)
 if err != nil {
     // ...
 }
 // ...
}
```

However, the result of a Workflow Execution can be obtained from a completely different process.
All that is needed is the [Workflow Id](#).
(A [Run Id](#) is optional if more than one closed Workflow Execution has the same Workflow Id.)
The result of the Workflow Execution is available for as long as the Workflow Execution Event History remains in the system.

<!-- TODO (See [How long do Workflow Execution Histories persist](#)). -->

Call the `GetWorkflow()` method on an instance of the Go SDK Client and pass it the Workflow Id used to spawn the Workflow Execution.
Then call the `Get()` method on the instance of `WorkflowRun` that is returned, passing it a pointer to populate the result.

```go
 // ...
 workflowID := "Your-Custom-Workflow-Id"
 workflowRun := c.GetWorkflow(context.Background, workflowID)

 var result YourWorkflowResponse
 err = workflowRun.Get(context.Background(), &result)
 if err != nil {
     // ...
 }
 // ...

**Get last completion result**

In the case of a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Temporal Cron Job<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cron Job?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, you might need to get the result of the previous Workflow Run and use it in the current Workflow Run.

To do this, use the [`HasLastCompletionResult`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#HasLastCompletionResult) and [`GetLastCompletionResult`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLastCompletionResult) APIs, available from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow) package, directly in your Workflow code.

```go
type CronResult struct {
 Count int
}

func YourCronWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context) (CronResult, error) {
 count := 1

 if workflow.HasLastCompletionResult(ctx) {
   var lastResult CronResult
   if err := workflow.GetLastCompletionResult(ctx, &lastResult); err == nil {
     count = count + lastResult.Count
   }
 }

 newResult := CronResult {
   Count: count,
 }
 return newResult, nil
}
```

This will work even if one of the cron Workflow Runs fails.
The next Workflow Run gets the result of the last successfully Completed Workflow Run.

A synchronous Workflow Execution blocks your client thread until the Workflow Execution completes (or fails) and get the results (or error in case of failure).

The following example is a type-safe approach for getting the results of a synchronous Workflow Execution.

```java
 FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(
                FileProcessingWorkflow.class,
                WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                        .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                        .build();

// start sync and wait for results (or failure)
String result = workflow.processfile(new Argument());
```

An asynchronous Workflow Execution immediately returns a value to the caller.

The following examples show how to get the results of a Workflow Execution through typed and untyped `WorkflowStub`.

- **Typed WorkflowStub Example**

  ```java
  // create typed Workflow stub
  FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(FileProcessingWorkflow.class,
                WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                        .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                        .build());
  // use WorkflowClient.execute (if your Workflow takes in arguments) or WorkflowClient.start (for zero arguments)
  WorkflowClient.start(workflow::greetCustomer);
  ```

- **Untyped WorkflowStub Example**

  ```java
  WorkflowStub untyped = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub("FileProcessingWorkflow",
                  WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                          .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                          .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                          .build());

  // blocks until Workflow Execution has been started (not until it completes)
  untyped.start(argument);
  ```

If you need to wait for a Workflow Execution to complete after an asynchronous start, the most straightforward way is to call the blocking Workflow instance again.

Note that if `WorkflowOptions.WorkflowIdReusePolicy` is not set to `AllowDuplicate`, then instead of throwing `DuplicateWorkflowException`, it reconnects to an existing Workflow and waits for its completion.

The following example shows how to do this from a different process than the one that started the Workflow Execution.

```java
YourWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class, workflowId);

// Returns the result after waiting for the Workflow to complete.
String result = workflow.yourMethod();
```

Another way to connect to an existing Workflow and wait for its completion from another process, is to use `UntypedWorkflowStub`. For example:

```java
WorkflowStub workflowStub = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(workflowType, workflowOptions);

// Returns the result after waiting for the Workflow to complete.
String result = untyped.getResult(String.class);
```

**Get last (successful) completion result**

For a Temporal Cron Job, get the result of previous successful runs using `GetLastCompletionResult()`.
The method returns `null` if there is no previous completion.
The following example shows how to implement this in a Workflow.

```java
public String cronWorkflow() {
    String lastProcessedFileName = Workflow.getLastCompletionResult(String.class);

    // Process work starting from the lastProcessedFileName.
    // Business logic implementation goes here.
    // Updates lastProcessedFileName to the new value.

    return lastProcessedFileName;
}
```

Note that this works even if one of the Cron schedule runs failed.
The next schedule will still get the last successful result if it ever successfully completed at least once.
For example, for a daily cron Workflow, if the run succeeds on the first day and fails on the second day, then the third day run will get the result from first day's run using these APIs.

If you need to wait for the completion of a Workflow after an asynchronous start, make a blocking call to
the `WorkflowRun`->`getResult` method.

```php
$run = $workflowClient->start($accountTransfer, 'fromID', 'toID', 'refID', 1000);

var_dump($run->getResult());
```

Use [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`get_workflow_handle()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle) to return a Workflow handle.
Then use the [`result`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.workflowhandle#result) method to await on the result of the Workflow.

```python
handle = await client.start_workflow(
    YourWorkflow.run, "some arg", id="your-workflow-id", task_queue="your-task-queue"
)

# Wait for result
result = await handle.result()
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

To get a handle for an existing Workflow by its Id, you can use [`get_workflow_handle()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle), or use [`get_workflow_handle_for()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle_for) for type safety.

Then use [`describe()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.workflowhandle#describe) to get the current status of the Workflow.
If the Workflow does not exist, this call fails.

To return the results of a Workflow Execution:

```typescript
return (
  'Completed '
  + wf.workflowInfo().workflowId
  + ', Total Charged: '
  + totalCharged
);
```

`totalCharged` is just a function declared in your code. For a full example, see [subscription-workflow-project-template-typescript/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/subscription-workflow-project-template-typescript/blob/main/src/workflows.ts).

A Workflow function may return a result. If it doesn’t (in which case the return type is `Promise<void>`), the result will be `undefined`.

If you started a Workflow with `handle.start()`, you can choose to wait for the result anytime with `handle.result()`.

```typescript
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
const result = await handle.result();
```

Using a Workflow Handle isn't necessary with `client.execute()`.

Workflows that prematurely end will throw a `WorkflowFailedError` if you call `result()`.

If you call `result()` on a Workflow that prematurely ended for some reason, it throws a [`WorkflowFailedError` error](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowFailedError/) that reflects the reason. For that reason, it is recommended to catch that error.

```typescript
const handle = client.getHandle(workflowId);
try {
  const result = await handle.result();
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof WorkflowFailedError) {
    throw new Error('Temporal workflow failed: ' + workflowId, {
      cause: err,
    });
  } else {
    throw new Error('error from Temporal workflow ' + workflowId, {
      cause: err,
    });
  }
}
```
