The Testing section of the Temporal Application development guide describes the frameworks that facilitate Workflow and integration testing.

In the context of Temporal, you can create these types of automated tests:

- **End-to-end**: Running a Temporal Server and Worker with all its Workflows and Activities; starting and interacting with Workflows from a Client.
- **Integration**: Anything between end-to-end and unit testing.
  - Running Activities with mocked Context and other SDK imports (and usually network requests).
  - Running Workers with mock Activities, and using a Client to start Workflows.
  - Running Workflows with mocked SDK imports.
- **Unit**: Running a piece of Workflow or Activity code (a function or method) and mocking any code it calls.

We generally recommend writing the majority of your tests as integration tests.

Because the test server supports skipping time, use the test server for both end-to-end and integration tests with Workers.

## Test Activities

An Activity can be tested with a mock Activity environment, which provides a way to mock the Activity context, listen to Heartbeats, and cancel the Activity.
This behavior allows you to test the Activity in isolation by calling it directly, without needing to create a Worker to run the Activity.

### Run an Activity

If an Activity references its context, you need to mock that context when testing in isolation.

First, create a [`MockActivityEnvironment`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment).
The constructor accepts an optional partial Activity [`Info`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Info) object in case any info fields are needed for the test.

Then use [`MockActivityEnvironment.run()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment#run) to run a function in an Activity [Context](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Context).

```ts
import { Context } from '@temporalio/activity';
import { MockActivityEnvironment } from '@temporalio/testing';
import assert from 'assert';

// A function that takes two numbers and returns a promise that resolves to the sum of the two numbers
// and the current attempt.
async function activityFoo(a: number, b: number): Promise<number> {
  return a + b + Context.current().info.attempt;
}

// Create a MockActivityEnvironment with attempt set to 2. Run the activityFoo
// function with parameters 5 and 35. Assert that the result is 42.
const env = new MockActivityEnvironment({ attempt: 2 });
const result = await env.run(activityFoo, 5, 35);
assert.equal(result, 42);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Listen to Heartbeats

When an Activity sends a Heartbeat, be sure that you can see the Heartbeats in your test code so that you can verify them.

<Tabs

[`MockActivityEnvironment`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment) is an [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter) that emits a `heartbeat` event that you can use to listen for Heartbeats emitted by the Activity.

When an Activity is run by a Worker, Heartbeats are throttled to avoid overloading the server.
`MockActivityEnvironment`, however, does not throttle Heartbeats.

```ts
import { Context } from '@temporalio/activity';
import { MockActivityEnvironment } from '@temporalio/testing';
import assert from 'assert';

async function activityFoo(): Promise<void> {
  Context.current().heartbeat(6);
}

const env = new MockActivityEnvironment();

env.on('heartbeat', (d: unknown) => {
  assert(d === 6);
});

await env.run(activityFoo);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Cancel an Activity

If an Activity is supposed to react to a Cancellation, you can test whether it reacts correctly by canceling it.

[`MockActivityEnvironment`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment) exposes a [`.cancel()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment#cancel) method that cancels the Activity Context.

```ts
import { CancelledFailure, Context } from '@temporalio/activity';
import { MockActivityEnvironment } from '@temporalio/testing';
import assert from 'assert';

async function activityFoo(): Promise<void> {
  Context.current().heartbeat(6);
  // .sleep() is Cancellation-aware, which means that on Cancellation,
  // CancelledFailure will be thrown from it.
  await Context.current().sleep(100);
}

const env = new MockActivityEnvironment();

env.on('heartbeat', (d: unknown) => {
  assert(d === 6);
});

await assert.rejects(env.run(activityFoo), (err) => {
  assert.ok(err instanceof CancelledFailure);
});
```

## Test Workflows

### Mock Activities

Mock the Activity invocation when unit testing your Workflows.

When integration testing Workflows with a Worker, you can mock Activities by providing mock Activity implementations to the Worker.

**RoadRunner config**

To mock an Activity in PHP, use [RoadRunner Key-Value storage](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-kv) and add the following lines to your `tests/.rr.test.yaml` file.

```yaml
# tests/.rr.test.yaml
kv:
  test:
    driver: memory
    config:
      interval: 10
```

If you want to be able to mock Activities, use `WorkerFactory` from the `Temporal\Testing` Namespace
in your PHP Worker:

```php
// worker.test.php
use Temporal\Testing\WorkerFactory;

$factory = WorkerFactory::create();
$worker = $factory->newWorker();

$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(MyWorkflow::class);
$worker->registerActivity(MyActivity::class);
$factory->run();
```

Then, in your tests to mock an Activity, use the`ActivityMocker` class.

Assume we have the following Activity:

```php
#[ActivityInterface(prefix: "SimpleActivity.")]
interface SimpleActivityInterface
{
    #[ActivityMethod('doSomething')]
    public function doSomething(string $input): string;
```

To mock it in the test, you can do this:

```php
final class SimpleWorkflowTestCase extends TestCase
{
    private WorkflowClient $workflowClient;
    private ActivityMocker $activityMocks;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        $this->workflowClient = new WorkflowClient(ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233'));
        $this->activityMocks = new ActivityMocker();

        parent::setUp();
    }

    protected function tearDown(): void
    {
        $this->activityMocks->clear();
        parent::tearDown();
    }

    public function testWorkflowReturnsUpperCasedInput(): void
    {
        $this->activityMocks->expectCompletion('SimpleActivity.doSomething', 'world');
        $workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(SimpleWorkflow::class);
        $run = $this->workflowClient->start($workflow, 'hello');
        $this->assertSame('world', $run->getResult('string'));
    }
}
```

In the preceding test case, we do the following:

1. Instantiate `ActivityMocker` in the `setUp()` method of the test.
2. Clear the cache after each test in `tearDown()`.
3. Mock an Activity call to return a string `world`.

To mock a failure, use the `expectFailure()` method:

```php
$this->activityMocks->expectFailure('SimpleActivity.echo', new \LogicException('something went wrong'));
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

<TabItem value="typescript">

Implement only the relevant Activities for the Workflow being tested.

```ts
import type * as activities from './activities';

// Creating a mock object of the activities.
const mockActivities: Partial<typeof activities> = {
  makeHTTPRequest: async () => '99',
};

// Creating a worker with the mocked activities.
const worker = await Worker.create({
  activities: mockActivities,
  // ...
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Skip time

Some long-running Workflows can persist for months or even years.
Implementing the test framework allows your Workflow code to skip time and complete your tests in seconds rather than the Workflow's specified amount.

For example, if you have a Workflow sleep for a day, or have an Activity failure with a long retry interval, you don't need to wait the entire length of the sleep period to test whether the sleep function works.
Instead, test the logic that happens after the sleep by skipping forward in time and complete your tests in a timely manner.

:::note

Skipping time is not relevant to unit testing Workflow code, because in that case you’re mocking functions that take time, like sleep and Activity calls.

:::

The test framework included in most SDKs is an in-memory implementation of Temporal Server that supports skipping time.
Time is a global property of an instance of `TestWorkflowEnvironment`: skipping time (either automatically or manually) applies to all currently running tests.
If you need different time behaviors for different tests, run your tests in a series or with separate instances of the test server.
For example, you could run all tests with automatic time skipping in parallel, and then all tests with manual time skipping in series, and then all tests without time skipping in parallel.

#### Setting up

Learn to set up the time-skipping test framework in the SDK of your choice.

1. In the `tests` folder, create `bootstrap.php` with the following contents:

```php
declare(strict_types=1);

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Temporal\Testing\Environment;

$environment = Environment::create();
$environment->start();
register_shutdown_function(fn () => $environment->stop());
```

If you don't want to run the test server with all of your tests, you can add a condition to start a test only if the `RUN_TEMPORAL_TEST_SERVER` environment variable is present:

```php
if (getenv('RUN_TEMPORAL_TEST_SERVER') !== false) {
    $environment = Environment::create();
    $environment->start('./rr serve -c .rr.silent.yaml -w tests');
    register_shutdown_function(fn() => $environment->stop());
}
```

2. Add `bootstrap.php` and the `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS` environment variable to `phpunit.xml`:

```xml
<phpunit xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://schema.phpunit.de/9.3/phpunit.xsd"
         bootstrap="tests/bootstrap.php"
>
    <php>
        <env name="TEMPORAL_ADDRESS" value="127.0.0.1:7233" />
    </php>
</phpunit>
```

3. Add the test server executable to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
temporal-test-server
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

```bash
npm install @temporalio/testing
```

The `@temporalio/testing` package downloads the test server and exports [`TestWorkflowEnvironment`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment), which you use to connect the Client and Worker to the test server and interact with the test server.

[`TestWorkflowEnvironment.createTimeSkipping`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment#createtimeskipping) starts the test server.
A typical test suite should set up a single instance of the test environment to be reused in all tests (for example, in a [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) `beforeAll` hook or a [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) `before()` hook).

```typescript
import { TestWorkflowEnvironment } from '@temporalio/testing';

let testEnv: TestWorkflowEnvironment;

// beforeAll and afterAll are injected by Jest
beforeAll(async () => {
  testEnv = await TestWorkflowEnvironment.createTimeSkipping();
});

afterAll(async () => {
  await testEnv?.teardown();
});
```

`TestWorkflowEnvironment` has a [`client.workflow`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.testworkflowenvironment/#workflowclient) and [`nativeConnection`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment#nativeconnection) for creating Workers:

```typescript
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import { v4 as uuid4 } from 'uuid';
import { workflowFoo } from './workflows';

test('workflowFoo', async () => {
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,
    taskQueue: 'test',
    ...
  });
  const result = await worker.runUntil(
    testEnv.client.workflow.execute(workflowFoo, {
      workflowId: uuid4(),
      taskQueue: 'test',
    })
  );
  expect(result).toEqual('foo');
});
```

This test uses the test connection to create a Worker, runs the Worker until the Workflow is complete, and then makes an assertion about the Workflow’s result.
The Workflow is executed using `testEnv.workflowClient`, which is connected to the test server.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Automatic method

You can skip time automatically in the SDK of your choice.
Start a test server process that skips time as needed.
For example, in the time-skipping mode, Timers, which include sleeps and conditional timeouts, are fast-forwarded except when Activities are running.

Use the [`start_local()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.testing.workflowenvironment#start_local) method for a full local Temporal server.

Use the [`from_client`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.testing.workflowenvironment#from_client) method for an existing Temporal sever.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

The test server starts in "normal" time.
When you use `TestWorkflowEnvironment.workflowClient.execute()` or `.result()`, the test server switches to "skipped" time mode until the Workflow completes.
In "skipped" mode, timers (`sleep()` calls and `condition()` timeouts) are fast-forwarded except when Activities are running.

```ts
import { sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';

export async function sleeperWorkflow() {
  await sleep('1 day');

    }),
  );

You can call `testEnv.sleep()` from your test code to advance the test server's time.
This is useful for testing intermediate states or indefinitely long-running Workflows.
However, to use `testEnv.sleep()`, you need to avoid automatic time skipping by starting the Workflow with `.start()` instead of `.execute()` (and not calling `.result()`).

`workflow.ts`

```ts
import { sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';
import { defineQuery, setHandler } from '@temporalio/workflow';

export const daysQuery = defineQuery('days');

export async function sleeperWorkflow() {
  let numDays = 0;

  setHandler(daysQuery, () => numDays);

  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    await sleep('1 day');
    numDays++;
  }
}
```

`test.ts`

```ts
test('sleeperWorkflow counts days correctly', async () => {
  // `start()` starts the test server in "normal" mode, not skipped time mode.
  // If you don't advance time using `testEnv.sleep()`, then `sleeperWorkflow()`
  // will run for days.
  handle = await testEnv.workflowClient.start(sleeperWorkflow, {
    workflowId: uuid4(),
    taskQueue,
  });

  let numDays = await handle.query(daysQuery);
  assert.equal(numDays, 0);

  // Advance the test server's time by 25 hours
  await testEnv.sleep('25 hours');
  numDays = await handle.query(daysQuery);
  assert.equal(numDays, 1);

  await testEnv.sleep('25 hours');
  numDays = await handle.query(daysQuery);
  assert.equal(numDays, 2);

Call [`TestWorkflowEnvironment.sleep`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.testworkflowenvironment/#sleep) from the mock Activity.

In the following test, `processOrderWorkflow` sends a notification to the user after one day.
The `processOrder` mocked Activity calls `testEnv.sleep(‘2 days’)`, during which the Workflow sends email (by calling the `sendNotificationEmail` Activity).

### Workflow context

For a function or method to run in the Workflow context (where it’s possible to get the current Workflow info, or running inside the sandbox in the case of TypeScript or Python), it needs to be run by the Worker as if it were a Workflow.

:::note

This section is applicable in Python and TypeScript.
In Python, we allow testing of Workflows only and not generic Workflow-related code.

:::

To test a function in your Workflow code that isn’t a Workflow, put the file it’s exported from in [WorkerOptions.workflowsPath](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#workflowspath).
Then execute the function as if it were a Workflow:

`workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test.ts`

```ts
import { sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';

export async function functionToTest(): Promise<number> {
  await sleep('1 day');
  return 42;
}
```

`test.ts`

```ts
const worker = await Worker.create({
  connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,
  workflowsPath: require.resolve(
    './workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test',
  ),
});

const result = await worker.runUntil(
  testEnv.workflowClient.execute(functionToTest, workflowOptions),
);

assert.equal(result, 42);
```

If `functionToTest` starts a Child Workflow, that Workflow must be exported from the same file (so that the Worker knows about it):

```ts
import { sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';
import { someWorkflowToRunAsChild } from './some-workflow';

export { someWorkflowToRunAsChild };

export async function functionToTest(): Promise<number> {
  const result = await wf.executeChild(someWorkflowToRunAsChild);
  return result + 42;
}
```

### Assert in Workflow

The `assert` statement is a convenient way to insert debugging assertions into the Workflow context.

The `assert` method is available in Python and TypeScript.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

The Node.js [`assert`](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) module is included in Workflow bundles.

By default, a failed `assert` statement throws `AssertionError`, which causes a <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#workflow-task">Workflow Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Task?</p><p class="tdlppd">A Workflow Task is a Task that contains the context needed to make progress with a Workflow Execution.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a href="/tasks#workflow-task">Learn more</a></p></div></a> to fail and be indefinitely retried.

To prevent this behavior, use [`workflowInterceptorModules`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/testing/#workflowinterceptormodules) from `@temporalio/testing`.
These interceptors catch an `AssertionError` and turn it into an `ApplicationFailure` that fails the entire Workflow Execution (not just the Workflow Task).

`workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test.ts`

```ts
import assert from 'assert';

export async function functionToTest() {
  assert.ok(false);
}
```

`test.ts`

```ts
import {
  TestWorkflowEnvironment,
  workflowInterceptorModules,
} from '@temporalio/testing';

const worker = await Worker.create({
  connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,
  interceptors: {
    workflowModules: workflowInterceptorModules,
  },
  workflowsPath: require.resolve(
    './workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test',

});

await worker.runUntil(
  testEnv.workflowClient.execute(functionToTest, workflowOptions), // throws WorkflowFailedError

## Replay

Replay recreates the exact state of a Workflow Execution.
You can replay a Workflow from the beginning of its history when resumed.

Replay allows code to resume only if it is compatible from a deterministic point of view.

To retrieve the Workflow History, use any of the following options and then pass the object to your SDK of choice.

)

func GetWorkflowHistory(ctx context.Context, client client.Client, id, runID string) (*history.History, error) {
	var hist history.History
	iter := client.GetWorkflowHistory(ctx, id, runID, false, enums.HISTORY_EVENT_FILTER_TYPE_ALL_EVENT)
	for iter.HasNext() {
		event, err := iter.Next()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		hist.Events = append(hist.Events, event)
	}
	return &hist, nil
}
```

This history can then be used to _replay_.
For example, the following code creates a `WorkflowReplayer` and register the `YourWorkflow` Workflow function.
Then it calls the `ReplayWorkflowHistory` to _replay_ the Event History and return an error code.

```go
import (
	"context"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
)

func ReplayWorkflow(ctx context.Context, client client.Client, id, runID string) error {
	hist, err := GetWorkflowHistory(ctx, client, id, runID)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	replayer := worker.NewWorkflowReplayer()
	replayer.RegisterWorkflow(YourWorkflow)
	return replayer.ReplayWorkflowHistory(nil, hist)
}
```

The code above will cause the Worker to re-execute the Workflow's Workflow Function using the original Event History.
If a noticeably different code path was followed or some code caused a deadlock, it will be returned in the error code.
Replaying a Workflow Execution locally is a good way to see exactly what code path was taken for given input and events.

To replay a Workflow Execution, use the [`replay_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.Replayer.html#replay_workflow) method and pass a Workflow History as an argument.

In the following example, `history_json_str` references the Workflow History as a JSON string.

```python
async def run_replayer(history_json_str: str):
    replayer = Replayer(workflows=[YourWorkflow])
    await replayer.replay_workflow(history_json_str)
```

If the Workflow History is non-deterministic, `run_replayer()` raises an error.

:::note

If the Workflow History is exported by [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui) or through [tctl](/tctl-v1), you can pass the JSON file history object as a JSON string or as a Python dictionary through the `json.load()` function, which takes a file object and returns the JSON object.

Retrieve Event History with [`WorkflowService.getWorkflowExecutionHistory`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/proto.temporal.api.workflowservice.v1.workflowservice-1/#getworkflowexecutionhistory).

Then call [`Worker.runReplayHistory`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.worker/#runreplayhistory).

If the Workflow code isn’t compatible with the Event History, `runReplayHistory` throws a [`DeterminismViolationError`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.determinismviolationerror/).
