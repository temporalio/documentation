description: The Testing section of the Temporal Application development guide covers the many ways to test the state of your Temporal Application; that is, ways to view which Workflow Executions are tracked by the Platform and the state of any given Workflow Execution, either currently or at points of an execution.

Temporal provides a framework to facilitate Workflow and integration testing.

## Replay

Replay recreates the exact state of a Workflow Execution.
You can replay a Workflow from the beginning of its history when resumed.

Replay allows code to resume only if it is compatible from a deterministic point of view.

To retrieve the Workflow History, use any of the following options and then pass the object to your SDK of choice.

Use the [worker.WorflowReplayer](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#WorkflowReplayer) to replay an existing Workflow Execution from its Event History to replicate errors.

For example, the following code retrieves the Event History of a Workflow:

```go
import (
	"context"

	"go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1"
	"go.temporal.io/api/history/v1"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)

func GetWorkflowHistory(ctx context.Context, client client.Client, id, runID string) (*history.History, error) {
	var hist history.History
	iter := client.GetWorkflowHistory(ctx, id, runID, false, enums.HISTORY_EVENT_FILTER_TYPE_ALL_EVENT)
	for iter.HasNext() {
		event, err := iter.Next()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		hist.Events = append(hist.Events, event)
	}
	return &hist, nil
}
```

This history can then be used to _replay_.
For example, the following code creates a `WorkflowReplayer` and register the `YourWorkflow` Workflow function.
Then it calls the `ReplayWorkflowHistory` to _replay_ the Event History and return an error code.

```go
import (
	"context"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
)

func ReplayWorkflow(ctx context.Context, client client.Client, id, runID string) error {
	hist, err := GetWorkflowHistory(ctx, client, id, runID)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	replayer := worker.NewWorkflowReplayer()
	replayer.RegisterWorkflow(YourWorkflow)
	return replayer.ReplayWorkflowHistory(nil, hist)
}
```

The code above will cause the Worker to re-execute the Workflow's Workflow Function using the original Event History.
If a noticeably different code path was followed or some code caused a deadlock, it will be returned in the error code.
Replaying a Workflow Execution locally is a good way to see exactly what code path was taken for given input and events.

To replay a Workflow Execution, use the [`replay_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.replayer#replay_workflow) method and pass a Workflow History as an argument.

In the following example, `history_json_str` references the Workflow History as a JSON string.

```python
async def run_replayer(history_json_str: str):
    replayer = Replayer(workflows=[YourWorkflow])
    await replayer.replay_workflow(history_json_str)
```

If the Workflow History is non-deterministic, `run_replayer()` raises an error.

:::note

If the Workflow History is exported by [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui) or through [tctl](/tctl), you can pass the JSON file history object as a JSON string or as a Python dictionary through the `json.load()` function, which takes a file object and returns the JSON object.
