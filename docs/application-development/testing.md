The testing section of the Temporal Application development guide describes the frameworks that facilitate Workflow and integration testing.

In the context of Temporal, you can create these types of automated tests:

- **End-to-end**: Running a Temporal Server and Worker with all its Workflows and Activities; starting and interacting with Workflows from a Client.
  - Running Activities with mocked Context and other SDK imports (and usually network requests).
  - Running Workers with mock Activities, and using a Client to start Workflows.
  - Running Workflows with mocked SDK imports.
- **Integration**: Anything between end-to-end and unit testing, including:
- **Unit**: Running a piece of Workflow or Activity code (a function or method) and mocking any code it calls.

We generally recommend writing the majority of your tests as integration tests.

For both end-to-end tests and integration tests with a Worker, we recommend using the Test Server, as it supports [skipping time](#skip-time).

## Test Activities

Activities can be tested with a mock Activity environment, which provides a way to mock Activity context, listen to heartbeats, and cancel the Activity. This allows you to test the Activity in isolation by calling it directly, without needing to create a Worker to run the Activity.

### Run an Activity

If an Activity references its context, you need to mock that context when testing in isolation.

First, create a [`MockActivityEnvironment`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment). The constructor accepts an optional partial Activity [`Info`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.Info) object in case any info fields are needed for the test.

Then use [`MockActivityEnvironment.run()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment#run) to run a function in an Activity [Context](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/activity.context):

```ts
import {MockActivityEnvironment} from "@temporalio/testing";
import {Context} from "@temporalio/activity";
import assert from "assert";

// A function that takes two numbers and returns a promise that resolves to the sum of the two numbers
// and the current attempt.
async function activityFoo(a: number, b: number): Promise<number> {
  return a + b + Context.current().info.attempt;
}

// Creating a new MockActivityEnvironment with the attempt set to 2. Then it is running the activityFoo
// function with the parameters 5 and 35. Then it is asserting that the result is 42.
const env = new MockActivityEnvironment({attempt: 2});
const result = await env.run(activityFoo, 5, 35);
assert.equal(result, 42);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Listen to Heartbeats

When an Activity sends Heartbeats, you want to be able to see them in your test code in order to assert they’re correct.

<Tabs

groupId="site-lang"

<TabItem value="typescript">

[`MockActivityEnvironment`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment) is an [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter) that emits a `heartbeat` event that you can use to listen for heartbeats emitted by the Activity.

When an Activity is run by a Worker, heartbeats are throttled to avoid overloading the server.
`MockActivityEnvironment`, on the other hand, does not throttle heartbeats.

```ts
import {MockActivityEnvironment} from "@temporalio/testing";
import {Context} from "@temporalio/activity";
import assert from "assert";

async function activityFoo(): Promise<void> {
  Context.current().heartbeat(6);
}

const env = new MockActivityEnvironment();

env.on("heartbeat", (d: unknown) => {
  assert(d === 6);
});

await env.run(activityFoo);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Cancel an Activity

If an Activity is supposed to react to Cancellation, you can test whether it reacts correctly by canceling it.

[`MockActivityEnvironment`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment) exposes a [`.cancel()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.MockActivityEnvironment#cancel) method which cancels the Activity Context:

```ts
import {MockActivityEnvironment} from "@temporalio/testing";
import {CancelledFailure, Context} from "@temporalio/activity";
import assert from "assert";

async function activityFoo(): Promise<void> {
  Context.current().heartbeat(6);
  // .sleep() is Cancellation-aware, which means that on Cancellation,
  // CancelledFailure will be thrown from it.
  await Context.current().sleep(100);
}

const env = new MockActivityEnvironment();

env.on("heartbeat", (d: unknown) => {
  assert(d === 6);
});

await assert.rejects(env.run(activityFoo), (err) => {
  assert.ok(err instanceof CancelledFailure);
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Test Workflows

### Mock Activities

When unit testing Workflows, you can mock the Activity invocation. When integration testing Workflows with a Worker, you can mock Activities by providing mock Activity implementations to the Worker.

**RoadRunner config**

To mock an Activity in PHP, use [RoarRunner Key-Value storage](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-kv) and add the following lines to your `tests/.rr.test.yaml` file.

```yaml
# tests/.rr.test.yaml
kv:
  test:
    driver: memory
    config:
      interval: 10
```

Notice, that if you want to have ability to mock activities you should use `WorkerFactory` from `Temporal\Testing` namespace
in your PHP worker:

```php
// worker.test.php
use Temporal\Testing\WorkerFactory;

$factory = WorkerFactory::create();
$worker = $factory->newWorker();

$worker->registerWorkflowTypes(MyWorkflow::class);
$worker->registerActivity(MyActivity::class);
$factory->run();
```

Then, in your tests to mock an Activity use `ActivityMocker` class.

Assume we have the following activity:

```php
#[ActivityInterface(prefix: "SimpleActivity.")]
interface SimpleActivityInterface
{
    #[ActivityMethod('doSomething')]
    public function doSomething(string $input): string;
```

To mock it in the test you can do this:

```php
final class SimpleWorkflowTestCase extends TestCase
{
    private WorkflowClient $workflowClient;
    private ActivityMocker $activityMocks;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        $this->workflowClient = new WorkflowClient(ServiceClient::create('localhost:7233'));
        $this->activityMocks = new ActivityMocker();

        parent::setUp();
    }

    protected function tearDown(): void
    {
        $this->activityMocks->clear();
        parent::tearDown();
    }

    public function testWorkflowReturnsUpperCasedInput(): void
    {
        $this->activityMocks->expectCompletion('SimpleActivity.doSomething', 'world');
        $workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(SimpleWorkflow::class);
        $run = $this->workflowClient->start($workflow, 'hello');
        $this->assertSame('world', $run->getResult('string'));
    }
}
```

In the test case above we:

1. Instantiate instance of `ActivityMocker` class in `setUp()` method of the test.
2. Don't forget to clear the cache after each test in `tearDown()`.
3. Mock an activity call to return a string `world`.

To mock a failure use `expectFailure()` method:

```php
$this->activityMocks->expectFailure('SimpleActivity.echo', new \LogicException('something went wrong'));
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

Implement only the relevant Activities for the Workflow being tested.

```ts
import type * as activities from "./activities";

// Creating a mock object of the activities.
const mockActivities: Partial<typeof activities> = {
  makeHTTPRequest: async () => "99",
};

// Creating a worker with the mocked activities.
const worker = await Worker.create({
  activities: mockActivities,
  // ...
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Skip Time

Some long-running Workflows can persist for months or even years. Implementing the test framework allows your Workflow code to skip time and complete your tests in seconds, rather than months. For example, you might have a Workflow sleep for a day or have Activity failures with a long retry interval. When testing this code, you don't need to test whether the sleep functions, as you can trust Temporal executes that functionality correctly.

Instead, test the logic that happens after the sleep by skipping forward time and complete your tests in a timely manner.

:::note

Skipping time is not relevant to unit testing Workflow code, since in that case you’re mocking functions that take time like sleep and Activity calls.

:::

The test framework included in most SDKs is an in-memory implementation of Temporal Server that supports skipping time. Time is a global property of an instance of the Test Server: if you skip time (either automatically or manually), it applies to all currently running tests. If you need different time behaviors for different tests, then run your tests in a series or with a separate instance of the Test Server. For example, you could run all tests with automatic time skipping in parallel, and then all tests with manual time skipping in series, and then all tests without time skipping in parallel.

#### Setting up

Learn to set up the time skipping test framework in the SDK of your choice.

1. Create `bootstrap.php` in `tests` folder with the following contents:

```php
declare(strict_types=1);

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Temporal\Testing\Environment;

$environment = Environment::create();
$environment->start();
register_shutdown_function(fn () => $environment->stop());
```

If you don't want to run temporal test server with all of your tests you can set, for example,
add condition to start it only if `RUN_TEMPORAL_TEST_SERVER` environment variable is present:

```php
if (getenv('RUN_TEMPORAL_TEST_SERVER') !== false) {
    $environment = Environment::create();
    $environment->start('./rr serve -c .rr.silent.yaml -w tests');
    register_shutdown_function(fn() => $environment->stop());
}
```

2. Add environment variable and `bootstrap.php` to your `phpunit.xml`:

```xml
<phpunit xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://schema.phpunit.de/9.3/phpunit.xsd"
         bootstrap="tests/bootstrap.php"
>
    <php>
        <env name="TEMPORAL_ADDRESS" value="127.0.0.1:7233" />
    </php>
</phpunit>
```

3. Add test server executable to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
temporal-test-server
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

```bash
npm install @temporalio/testing
```

The `@temporalio/testing` package downloads the Test Server and exports [`TestWorkflowEnvironment`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment), which you use to connect the Client and Worker to the Test Server and interact with the Test Server.

[`TestWorkflowEnvironment.createTimeSkipping`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment#createtimeskipping) starts the Test Server. A typical test suite should set up a single instance of the test environment to be reused in all tests (for example, in a [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) `beforeAll` hook or a [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) `before()` hook).

```typescript
import {TestWorkflowEnvironment} from "@temporalio/testing";

let testEnv: TestWorkflowEnvironment;

// beforeAll and afterAll are injected by Jest
beforeAll(async () => {
  testEnv = await TestWorkflowEnvironment.createTimeSkipping();
});

afterAll(async () => {
  await testEnv?.teardown();
});
```

`TestWorkflowEnvironment` has a [`client.workflow`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.testworkflowenvironment/#workflowclient) and [`nativeConnection`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment#nativeconnection) for creating Workers:

```typescript
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import { v4 as uuid4 } from 'uuid';
import { workflowFoo } from './workflows';

test('workflowFoo', async () => {
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,
    taskQueue: 'test',
    ...
  });
  const result = await worker.runUntil(
    testEnv.client.workflow.execute(workflowFoo, {
      workflowId: uuid4(),
      taskQueue: 'test',
    })
  );
  expect(result).toEqual('foo');
});
```

This test uses the test connection to create a Worker, runs the Worker until the Workflow is complete, and then makes an assertion about the Workflow’s result. The Workflow is executed using `testEnv.workflowClient`, which is connected to the Test Server.

The Test Server starts in "normal" time. When you use `TestWorkflowEnvironment.workflowClient.execute()` or `.result()`, the Test Server is switched to "skipped" time mode until the Workflow completes. In "skipped" mode, timers (`sleep()`s and `condition()` timeouts) are fast-forwarded except when Activities are running.

`workflows.ts`

```ts
import {sleep} from "@temporalio/workflow";

export async function sleeperWorkflow() {
  await sleep("1 day");
}
```

`test.ts`

import {sleeperWorkflow} from "./workflows";

test("sleep completes almost immediately", async () => {
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,

You can also call `testEnv.sleep()` from your test code to advance the Test Server's time.
This is useful for testing intermediate state, or for testing indefinitely long-running Workflows.
However, to use `testEnv.sleep()`, you need to avoid automatic time skipping by starting the Workflow with `.start()` instead of `.execute()` (and not calling `.result()`).

`workflow.ts`

```ts
import {sleep} from "@temporalio/workflow";
import {defineQuery, setHandler} from "@temporalio/workflow";

export const daysQuery = defineQuery("days");

export async function sleeperWorkflow() {
  let numDays = 0;

  setHandler(daysQuery, () => numDays);

  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    await sleep("1 day");
    numDays++;
  }
}
```

`test.ts`

```ts
test("sleeperWorkflow counts days correctly", async () => {
  // `start()` starts the test server in "normal" mode, not skipped time mode.
  // If you don't advance time using `testEnv.sleep()`, then `sleeperWorkflow()`
  // will run for days.
  handle = await testEnv.workflowClient.start(sleeperWorkflow, {
    workflowId: uuid4(),
    taskQueue,
  });

  let numDays = await handle.query(daysQuery);
  assert.equal(numDays, 0);

  // Advance the test server's time by 25 hours
  await testEnv.sleep("25 hours");
  numDays = await handle.query(daysQuery);
  assert.equal(numDays, 1);

  await testEnv.sleep("25 hours");
  numDays = await handle.query(daysQuery);
  assert.equal(numDays, 2);
});

[`TestWorkflowEnvironment.sleep`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.testworkflowenvironment/#sleep)
from the mock Activity.

In the below test, `processOrderWorkflow` sends a notification to the user after 1 day. The `processOrder` mocked Activity calls `testEnv.sleep(‘2 days’)`, during which the Workflow will send the email (by calling the `sendNotificationEmail` Activity). Then once the Workflow completes, we assert that `sendNotificationEmail` was called.

### Workflow context

In order for a function or method to be run in the Workflow context (where it’s possible to get the current Workflow info, or running inside the sandbox/isolate in the case of TS and Python), it needs to be run by the Worker as if it were a Workflow.

:::note

This section is applicable in Python and TypeScript. In Python we only allow testing of Workflows and not generic Workflow-related code.

To test a function in your Workflow code that isn’t a Workflow, put the file it’s exported from in [WorkerOptions.workflowsPath](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#workflowspath). Then execute it as if it were a Workflow:

`workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test.ts`

```ts
import {sleep} from "@temporalio/workflow";

export async function functionToTest(): Promise<number> {
  await sleep("1 day");
  return 42;
}
```

`test.ts`

```ts
const worker = await Worker.create({
  connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,
  workflowsPath: require.resolve(
    "./workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test"
  ),
});

const result = await worker.runUntil(
  testEnv.workflowClient.execute(functionToTest, workflowOptions)
);

assert.equal(result, 42);
```

If the `functionToTest` starts a Child Workflow, that Workflow must be exported from the same file (so that the Worker knows about it):

```ts
import {sleep} from "@temporalio/workflow";
import {someWorkflowToRunAsChild} from "./some-workflow";

export {someWorkflowToRunAsChild};

export async function functionToTest(): Promise<number> {
  const result = await wf.executeChild(someWorkflowToRunAsChild);
  return result + 42;
}
```

### Assert in Workflow

The `assert` statement is a convenient way to insert debugging assertions into the Workflow context.

The `assert` method is available in Python and TypeScript.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

The Node.js [`assert`](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) module is included in Workflow bundles.

By default, failed `assert` statements throw `AssertionError`s which cause [Workflow Tasks](/tasks#workflow-task) to fail and be indefinitely retried.

To prevent this, use [`workflowInterceptorModules`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/testing/#workflowinterceptormodules) from `@temporalio/testing`. These interceptors catch `AssertionError`s and turn them into `ApplicationFailure`s that fail the entire Workflow Execution (not just the Workflow Task).

`workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test.ts`

```ts
import assert from "assert";

export async function functionToTest() {
  assert.ok(false);
}
```

`test.ts`

```ts
import {
  TestWorkflowEnvironment,
  workflowInterceptorModules,
} from "@temporalio/testing";

const worker = await Worker.create({
  connection: testEnv.nativeConnection,
  interceptors: {
    workflowModules: workflowInterceptorModules,
  },
  workflowsPath: require.resolve(
    "./workflows/file-with-workflow-function-to-test"

});

await worker.runUntil(
  testEnv.workflowClient.execute(functionToTest, workflowOptions) // throws WorkflowFailedError

## Replay

Replay recreates the exact state of a Workflow Execution.
You can replay a Workflow from the beginning of its history when resumed.

Replay allows code to resume only if it is compatible from a deterministic point of view.

To retrieve the Workflow History, use any of the following options and then pass the object to your SDK of choice.

<TabItem value="go">

Use the [worker.WorflowReplayer](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#WorkflowReplayer) to replay an existing Workflow Execution from its Event History to replicate errors.

For example, the following code retrieves the Event History of a Workflow:

```go
import (

	"go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1"
	"go.temporal.io/api/history/v1"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)

func GetWorkflowHistory(ctx context.Context, client client.Client, id, runID string) (*history.History, error) {
	var hist history.History
	iter := client.GetWorkflowHistory(ctx, id, runID, false, enums.HISTORY_EVENT_FILTER_TYPE_ALL_EVENT)
	for iter.HasNext() {
		event, err := iter.Next()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		hist.Events = append(hist.Events, event)

	return &hist, nil
}
```

This history can then be used to _replay_.
For example, the following code creates a `WorkflowReplayer` and register the `YourWorkflow` Workflow function.
Then it calls the `ReplayWorkflowHistory` to _replay_ the Event History and return an error code.

```go
import (
	"context"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
)

func ReplayWorkflow(ctx context.Context, client client.Client, id, runID string) error {
	hist, err := GetWorkflowHistory(ctx, client, id, runID)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	replayer := worker.NewWorkflowReplayer()
	replayer.RegisterWorkflow(YourWorkflow)
	return replayer.ReplayWorkflowHistory(nil, hist)
}
```

The code above will cause the Worker to re-execute the Workflow's Workflow Function using the original Event History.
If a noticeably different code path was followed or some code caused a deadlock, it will be returned in the error code.
Replaying a Workflow Execution locally is a good way to see exactly what code path was taken for given input and events.

To replay a Workflow Execution, use the [`replay_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.replayer#replay_workflow) method and pass a Workflow History as an argument.

In the following example, `history_json_str` references the Workflow History as a JSON string.

```python
async def run_replayer(history_json_str: str):
    replayer = Replayer(workflows=[YourWorkflow])
    await replayer.replay_workflow(history_json_str)
```

If the Workflow History is non-deterministic, `run_replayer()` raises an error.

:::note

If the Workflow History is exported by [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui) or through [tctl](/tctl), you can pass the JSON file history object as a JSON string or as a Python dictionary through the `json.load()` function, which takes a file object and returns the JSON object.

Retrieve Event History with [`WorkflowService.getWorkflowExecutionHistory`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/proto.temporal.api.workflowservice.v1.workflowservice-1/#getworkflowexecutionhistory).

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-history-get-workflowhistory-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

Then call [`Worker.runReplayHistory`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.worker/#runreplayhistory).

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-history-replay-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

`runReplayHistory` will throw a [`DeterminismViolationError`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/workflow.determinismviolationerror/) if the Workflow code isn’t compatible with the History.
