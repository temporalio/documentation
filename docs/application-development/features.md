## Signals

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#signal">Signal<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Signal?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Signal is an asynchronous request to a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#signal">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a message sent to a running Workflow Execution.

Signals are defined in your code and handled in your Workflow Definition.
Signals can be sent to Workflow Executions from a Temporal Client or from another Workflow Execution.

### Define Signal

A Signal has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Signal type, is a string.
- The arguments must be <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#">serializable<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

All interface methods must have one of the following annotations:

- **#[WorkflowMethod]** indicates an entry point to a Workflow.
  It contains parameters that specify timeouts and a Task Queue name.
  Required parameters (such as `executionStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds`) that are not specified through the annotation must be provided at runtime.
- **#[SignalMethod]** indicates a method that reacts to external signals. It must have a `void` return type.
- **#[QueryMethod]** indicates a method that reacts to synchronous query requests. It must have a non `void` return type.

> It is possible (though not recommended for usability reasons) to annotate concrete class implementation.

You can have more than one method with the same annotation (except #[WorkflowMethod]).

For example:

```php
use Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowInterface;
use Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowMethod;
use Temporal\Workflow\SignalMethod;
use Temporal\Workflow\QueryMethod;

#[WorkflowInterface]
interface FileProcessingWorkflow
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function processFile(Argument $args);

    #[QueryMethod("history")]
    public function getHistory(): array;

    #[QueryMethod("status")]
    public function getStatus(): string;

    #[SignalMethod]
    public function retryNow(): void;

    #[SignalMethod]
    public function abandon(): void;
}
```

Note that name parameter of Workflow method annotations can be used to specify name of Workflow, Signal and Query types.
If name is not specified the short name of the Workflow interface is used.

In the above code the `#[WorkflowMethod(name)]` is not specified, thus the Workflow Type defaults to `"FileProcessingWorkflow"`.

### Handle Signal

Workflows listen for Signals by the Signal's name.

Use the `#[SignalMethod]` annotation to handle Signals in the Workflow interface:

```php
use Temporal\Workflow;

#[Workflow\WorkflowInterface]
class YourWorkflow
{
    private bool $value;

    #[Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
    public function run()
    {
        yield Workflow::await(fn()=> $this->value);
        return 'OK';
    }

    #[Workflow\SignalMethod]
    public function setValue(bool $value)
    {
        $this->value = $value;
    }
}
```

In the preceding example, the Workflow updates the protected value.
The main Workflow coroutine waits for the value to change by using the `Workflow::await()` function.

### Send Signal from Client

When a Signal is sent successfully from the Temporal Client, the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.

To send a Signal to a Workflow Execution from a Client, call the Signal method, annotated with `#[SignalMethod]` in the Workflow interface, from the Client code.

To send a Signal to a Workflow, use `WorkflowClient->newWorkflowStub` or `WorkflowClient->newUntypedWorkflowStub`:

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow::class);

$run = $workflowClient->start($workflow);

// do something

$workflow->setValue(true);

assert($run->getValue() === true);
```

Use `WorkflowClient->newRunningWorkflowStub` or `WorkflowClient->newUntypedRunningWorkflowStub` with Workflow Id to send Signals to already running Workflows.

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newRunningWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow::class, 'workflowID');
$workflow->setValue(true);
```

### Send Signal from Workflow

A Workflow can send a Signal to another Workflow, in which case it's called an _External Signal_.

When an External Signal is sent:

- A [SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated) Event appears in the sender's Event History.
- A [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the recipient's Event History.

// do something

$workflow->setValue(true);

assert($run->getValue() === true);
```

Use `WorkflowClient`->`newRunningWorkflowStub` or `WorkflowClient->newUntypedRunningWorkflowStub` with Workflow Id to send
Signals to a running Workflow.

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newRunningWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow::class, 'workflowID');
$workflow->setValue(true);

### Signal-With-Start

Signal-With-Start is used from the Client.
It takes a Workflow Id, Workflow arguments, a Signal name, and Signal arguments.

If there's a Workflow running with the given Workflow Id, it will be signaled. If there isn't, a new Workflow will be started and immediately signaled.

In cases where you may not know if a Workflow is running, and want to send a Signal to it, use `startwithSignal`.
If a running Workflow exists, the `startwithSignal` API sends the Signal.
If there is no running Workflow, the API starts a new Workflow Run and delivers the Signal to it.

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow::class);

$run = $workflowClient->startWithSignal(
    $workflow,
    'setValue',
    [true], // signal arguments
    [] // start arguments
);

### Handle Query

Queries are handled by your Workflow.

You can add custom Query types to handle Queries such as Querying the current state of a
Workflow, or Querying how many Activities the Workflow has completed. To do this, you need to set
up a Query handler using method attribute `QueryMethod` or `Workflow::registerQueryHandler`.

```php
#[Workflow\WorkflowInterface]
class YourWorkflow
{
    #[Workflow\QueryMethod]
    public function getValue()
    {
        return 42;
    }

    #[Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
    public function run()
    {
        // workflow code
    }

}
```

The handler function can receive any number of input parameters, but all input parameters must be
serializable. The following sample code sets up a Query handler that handles the Query type of
`currentState`:

```php
#[Workflow\WorkflowInterface]
class YourWorkflow
{
    private string $currentState;

    #[Workflow\QueryMethod('current_state')]
    public function getCurrentState(): string
    {
        return $this->currentState;
    }

    #[Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
    public function run()
    {
        // Your normal Workflow code begins here, and you update the currentState
        // as the code makes progress.
        $this->currentState = 'waiting timer';
        try{
            yield Workflow::timer(DateInterval::createFromDateString('1 hour'));
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
            $this->currentState = 'timer failed';
            throw $e;
        }

        $yourActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
            YourActivityInterface::class,
            ActivityOptions::new()->withScheduleToStartTimeout(60)
        );

        $this->currentState = 'waiting activity';
        try{
            yield $yourActivity->doSomething('some input');
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
            $this->currentState = 'activity failed';
            throw $e;
        }

        $this->currentState = 'done';

        return null;
    }
}
```

You can also issue a Query from code using the `QueryWorkflow()` API on a Temporal Client object.

Use `WorkflowStub` to Query Workflow instances from your Client code (can be applied to both running and closed Workflows):

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    YourWorkflow::class,
    WorkflowOptions::new()
);

$workflowClient->start($workflow);

var_dump($workflow->getCurrentState());
sleep(60);
var_dump($workflow->getCurrentState());
```

### Workflow retries

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#">Retry Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

### Activity retry simulator

Use this tool to visualize total Activity Execution times and experiment with different Activity timeouts and Retry Policies.

The simulator is based on a common Activity use-case, which is to call a third party HTTP API and return the results.
See the example code snippets below.

Use the Activity Retries settings to configure how long the API request takes to succeed or fail.
There is an option to generate scenarios.
The _Task Time in Queue_ simulates the time the Activity Task might be waiting in the Task Queue.

Use the Activity Timeouts and Retry Policy settings to see how they impact the success or failure of an Activity Execution.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Cluster when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Cluster.

Some Activities are long-running.
To react to a crash quickly, use the Heartbeat mechanism, `Activity::heartbeat()`, which lets the Temporal Server know that the Activity is still alive.
This acts as a periodic checkpoint mechanism for the progress of an Activity.

You can piggyback `details` on an Activity Heartbeat.
If an Activity times out, the last value of `details` is included in the `TimeoutFailure` delivered to a Workflow.
Then the Workflow can pass the details to the next Activity invocation.
Additionally, you can access the details from within an Activity via `Activity::getHeartbeatDetails`.
When an Activity is retried after a failure `getHeartbeatDetails` enables you to get the value from the last successful Heartbeat.

2. The Activity Function completes in a way that identifies it as waiting to be completed by an external system.
3. The Temporal Client is used to Heartbeat and complete the Activity.

Sometimes Workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.

Invoking activity stub without the use of `yield` will return the Activity result promise which can be resolved at later moment.
Calling `yield` on promise blocks until a result is available.

> Activity promise also exposes `then` method to construct promise chains.
> Read more about Promises [here](https://github.com/reactphp/promise).

Alternatively you can explicitly wrap your code (including `yield` constucts) using `Workflow::async` which will execute nested code in parallel with main Workflow code.
Call `yeild` on Promise returned by `Workflow::async` to merge execution result back to primary Workflow method.

```php
public function greet(string $name): \Generator
{
    // Workflow::async runs it's activities and child workflows in a separate coroutine. Use keyword yield to merge
    // it back to parent process.

    $first = Workflow::async(
        function () use ($name) {
            $hello = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hello', $name);
            $bye = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Bye', $name);

            return $hello . '; ' . $bye;
        }
    );

    $second = Workflow::async(
        function () use ($name) {
            $hello = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hola', $name);
            $bye = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Chao', $name);

            return $hello . '; ' . $bye;
        }
    );

    // blocks until $first and $second complete
    return (yield $first) . "\n" . (yield $second);
}
```

**Async completion**

There are certain scenarios when moving on from an Activity upon completion of its function is not possible or desirable.
For example, you might have an application that requires user input to complete the Activity.
You could implement the Activity with a polling mechanism, but a simpler and less resource-intensive implementation is to asynchronously complete a Temporal Activity.

There are two parts to implementing an asynchronously completed Activity:

1. The Activity provides the information necessary for completion from an external system and notifies the Temporal service that it is waiting for that outside callback.
2. The external service calls the Temporal service to complete the Activity.

The following example demonstrates the first part:

<!--SNIPSTART samples-php-async-activity-completion-activity-class-->

    /**
     * Demonstrates how to implement an Activity asynchronously.

        return 'ignored';
    }
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

The following code demonstrates how to complete the Activity successfully using `WorkflowClient`:

<!--SNIPSTART samples-php-async-activity-completion-completebytoken-->

[app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/CompleteCommand.php](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/blob/master/app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/CompleteCommand.php)

```php
$client = $this->workflowClient->newActivityCompletionClient();
// Complete the Activity.
$client->completeByToken(
    base64_decode($input->getArgument('token')),
    $input->getArgument('message')
);
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

To fail the Activity, you would do the following:

```php
// Fail the Activity.
$activityClient->completeExceptionallyByToken($taskToken, new \Error("activity failed"));
```

## Cancel an Activity

Canceling an Activity from within a Workflow requires that the Activity Execution sends Heartbeats and sets a Heartbeat Timeout.
If the Heartbeat is not invoked, the Activity cannot receive a cancellation request.
When any non-immediate Activity is executed, the Activity Execution should send Heartbeats and set a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Heartbeat Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Heartbeat Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Heartbeat Timeout is the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to ensure that the server knows it is still working.

When an Activity is canceled, an error is raised in the Activity at the next available opportunity.
If cleanup logic needs to be performed, it can be done in a `finally` clause or inside a caught cancel error.
However, for the Activity to appear canceled the exception needs to be re-raised.

:::note

Unlike regular Activities, <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#local-activity">Local Activities<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Local Activity?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Local Activity is an Activity Execution that executes in the same process as the Workflow Execution that spawns it.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#local-activity">Learn more</a></span></span></a> can be canceled if they don't send Heartbeats.
Local Activities are handled locally, and all the information needed to handle the cancellation logic is available in the same Worker process.

## Child Workflows

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#child-workflow">Child Workflow Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Child Workflow Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Child Workflow Execution is a Workflow Execution that is spawned from within another Workflow.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#child-workflow">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a Workflow Execution that is scheduled from within another Workflow using a Child Workflow API.

When using a Child Workflow API, Child Workflow related Events ([StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#startchildworkflowexecutioninitiated), [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted), [ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutioncompleted), etc...) are logged in the Workflow Execution Event History.

Always block progress until the [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted) Event is logged to the Event History to ensure the Child Workflow Execution has started.
After that, Child Workflow Executions may be abandoned using the default _Abandon_ <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Parent Close Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Parent Close Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">If a Workflow Execution is a Child Workflow Execution, a Parent Close Policy determines what happens to the Workflow Execution if its Parent Workflow Execution changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, Timed out).</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Learn more</a></span></span></a> set in the Child Workflow Options.

To be sure that the Child Workflow Execution has started, first call the Child Workflow Execution method on the instance of Child Workflow future, which returns a different future.

Then get the value of an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, which is what waits until the Child Workflow Execution has spawned.

Besides Activities, a Workflow can also start other Workflows.

`Workflow::executeChildWorkflow` and `Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub` enables the scheduling of other Workflows from within a Workflow's implementation.
The parent Workflow has the ability to monitor and impact the lifecycle of the Child Workflow, similar to the way it does for an Activity that it invoked.

```php
// Use one stub per child workflow run
$child = Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub(
    ChildWorkflowInterface::class,
    ChildWorkflowOptions::new()
        // Do not specify WorkflowId if you want Temporal to generate a unique Id
        // for the child execution.
        ->withWorkflowId('BID-SIMPLE-CHILD-WORKFLOW')
        ->withExecutionStartToCloseTimeout(DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 minutes'))
);

// This is a non blocking call that returns immediately.
// Use yield $child->workflowMethod(name) to call synchronously.
$promise = $child->workflowMethod('value');

// Do something else here.
try{
    $value = yield $promise;
} catch(TemporalException $e) {
    $logger->error('child workflow failed');
    throw $e;
}
```

Let's take a look at each component of this call.

Before calling `$child->workflowMethod()`, you must configure `ChildWorkflowOptions` for the invocation.
These options customize various execution timeouts, and are passed into the Workflow stub defined by the `Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub`.
Once stub created you can invoke its Workflow method based on attribute `WorkflowMethod`.

The method call returns immediately and returns a `Promise`.
This allows you to execute more code without having to wait for the scheduled Workflow to complete.

When you are ready to process the results of the Workflow, call the `yield $promise` method on the returned promise object.

When a parent Workflow is cancelled by the user, the Child Workflow can be cancelled or abandoned based on a configurable child policy.

You can also skip the stub part of Child Workflow initiation and use `Workflow::executeChildWorkflow` directly:

```php
// Use one stub per child workflow run
$childResult = yield Workflow::executeChildWorkflow(
    'ChildWorkflowName',
    ['args'],
    ChildWorkflowOptions::new()->withWorkflowId('BID-SIMPLE-CHILD-WORKFLOW'),
    Type::TYPE_STRING // optional: defines the return type
);
```

The possible values can be obtained from the [`ParentClosePolicy`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/blob/master/src/Workflow/ParentClosePolicy.php) class.

- `POLICY_TERMINATE`
- `POLICY_ABANDON`
- `POLICY_REQUEST_CANCEL`

Then `ChildWorkflowOptions` object is used to create a new Child Workflow object:

```php
$child = Workflow::newUntypedChildWorkflowStub(
    'child-workflow',
    ChildWorkflowOptions::new()
        ->withParentClosePolicy(ParentClosePolicy::POLICY_ABANDON)
);

yield $child->start();
```

In the snippet above we:

1. Create a new untyped Child Workflow stub with `Workflow::newUntypedChildWorkflowStub`.
2. Provide `ChildWorkflowOptions` object with Parent Close Policy set to `ParentClosePolicy::POLICY_ABANDON`.
3. Start Child Workflow Execution asynchronously using `yield` and method `start()`.

We need `yield` here to ensure that a Child Workflow Execution starts before the parent closes.

Workflows that need to rerun periodically could naively be implemented as a big **while** loop with a sleep where the entire logic of the Workflow is inside the body of the **while** loop.
The problem with this approach is that the history for that Workflow will keep growing to a point where it reaches the maximum size enforced by the service.

**ContinueAsNew** is the low level construct that enables implementing such Workflows without the risk of failures down the road.
The operation atomically completes the current execution and starts a new execution of the Workflow with the same **Workflow Id**.
The new execution will not carry over any history from the old execution.

To trigger this behavior, use `Workflow::continueAsNew` or `Workflow::newContinueAsNewStub` method:

```php
#[Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
public function periodic(string $name, int $value = 0)
{
    for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++) {
        // do something
        $value++;
    }

    // maintain $value counter between runs
    return Workflow::newContinueAsNewStub(self::class)->periodic($name, $value);
}

## Schedule a Workflow

Scheduling Workflows is a crucial aspect of any automation process, especially when dealing with time-sensitive tasks. By scheduling a Workflow, you can automate repetitive tasks, reduce the need for manual intervention, and ensure timely execution of your business processes

Use any of the following action to help Schedule a Workflow Execution and take control over your automation process.

### Create

The create action enables you to create a new Schedule. When you create a new Schedule, a unique Schedule ID is generated, which you can use to reference the Schedule in other Schedule commands.

## Timers

A Workflow can set a durable timer for a fixed time period.
In some SDKs, the function is called `sleep()`, and in others, it's called `timer()`.

A Workflow can sleep for months.
Timers are persisted, so even if your Worker or Temporal Cluster is down when the time period completes, as soon as your Worker and Cluster are back up, the `sleep()` call will resolve and your code will continue executing.

Sleeping is a resource-light operation: it does not tie up the process, and you can run millions of Timers off a single Worker.

To set a Timer in PHP, use `Workflow::timer()` and pass the number of seconds you want to wait before continuing.

The following example yields a sleep method for 5 minutes.

Set your Cron Schedule with `CronSchedule('* * * * *')`.

The following example sets a Cron Schedule in PHP:

```php
  $workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
      CronWorkflowInterface::class,
      WorkflowOptions::new()
          ->withWorkflowId(CronWorkflowInterface::WORKFLOW_ID)
          ->withCronSchedule('* * * * *')
          // Execution timeout limits total time. Cron will stop executing after this timeout.
          ->withWorkflowExecutionTimeout(CarbonInterval::minutes(10))
          // Run timeout limits duration of a single workflow invocation.
          ->withWorkflowRunTimeout(CarbonInterval::minute(1))
  );

  $output->writeln("Starting <comment>CronWorkflow</comment>... ");

  try {
      $run = $this->workflowClient->start($workflow, 'Antony');
      // ...
  }
```

Setting `withCronSchedule` turns the Workflow Execution into a Temporal Cron Job.
For more information, see the [PHP samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/tree/master/app/src/Cron) for example code or the PHP SDK `WorkflowOptions` [source code](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/blob/master/src/Client/WorkflowOptions.php).

## Side Effects

Side Effects are used to execute non-deterministic code, such as generating a UUID or a random number, without compromising deterministic in the Workflow. This is done by storing the non-deterministic results of the Side Effect into the Workflow [Event History](/workflows/#event-history).

A Side Effect does not re-execute during a Replay. Instead, it returns the recorded result from the Workflow Execution Event History.

Side Effects should not fail. An exception that is thrown from the Side Effect causes failure and retry of the current Workflow Task.

An Activity or a Local Activity may also be used instead of a Side effect, as its result is also persisted in Workflow Execution History.

:::note

You shouldn’t modify the Workflow state inside a Side Effect function, because it is not reexecuted during Replay. Side Effect function should be used to return a value.

### Mutable Side Effects

Mutable Side Effects execute the provided function once, and then it looks up the History of the value with the given Workflow ID.

- If there is no existing value, then it records the function result as a value with the given Workflow Id on the History.
- If there is an existing value, then it compares whether the existing value from the History has changed from the new function results, by calling the equals function.
  - If the values are equal, then it returns the value without recording a new Marker Event
  - If the values aren't equal, then it records the new value with the same ID on the History.

:::note

During a Workflow Execution, every new Side Effect call results in a new Marker recorded on the Workflow History; whereas Mutable Side Effects only records a new Marker on the Workflow History if the value for the Side Effect ID changes or is set the first time.

During a Replay, Mutable Side Effects will not execute the function again. Instead, it returns the exact same value that was returned during the Workflow Execution.

## Namespaces

You can create, update, deprecate or delete your <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Namespaces<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> using either tctl or SDK APIs.

Use Namespaces to isolate your Workflow Executions according to your needs.
For example, you can use Namespaces to match the development lifecycle by having separate `dev` and `prod` Namespaces.
You could also use them to ensure Workflow Executions between different teams never communicate - such as ensuring that the `teamA` Namespace never impacts the `teamB` Namespace.

On Temporal Cloud, use the <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Temporal Cloud UI<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud, use either Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to create and manage a Namespace from the UI, or [tcld commands](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to manage Namespaces from the command-line interface.

On self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you can register and manage your Namespaces using tctl (recommended) or programmatically using APIs. Note that these APIs and tctl commands will not work with Temporal Cloud.

Use a custom <a class="tdlp" href="/security#authorizer-plugin">Authorizer<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Authorizer Plugin?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">undefined</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#authorizer-plugin">Learn more</a></span></span></a> on your Frontend Service in the Temporal Cluster to set restrictions on who can create, update, or deprecate Namespaces.

You must register a Namespace with the Temporal Cluster before setting it in the Temporal Client.

### Register Namespace

Registering a Namespace creates a Namespace on the Temporal Cluster or Temporal Cloud.

On Temporal Cloud, use the <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Temporal Cloud UI<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud, use either Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or [tcld commands](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to create Namespaces.

## Custom payload conversion

Temporal SDKs provide a <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#payload-converter">Payload Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Payload Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Payload Converter serializes data, converting objects or values to bytes and back.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#payload-converter">Learn more</a></span></span></a> that can be customized to convert a custom data type to <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#payload">Payload<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Payload?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Payload represents binary data such as input and output from Activities and Workflows.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#payload">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and back.

Implementing custom Payload conversion is optional.
It is needed only if the <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#default-data-converter">default Data Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a default Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The default Data Converter is used by the Temporal SDK to convert objects into bytes using a series of Payload Converters.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#default-data-converter">Learn more</a></span></span></a> does not support your custom values.

The order in which your encoding Payload Converters are applied depend on the order given to the Data Converter.
You can set multiple encoding Payload Converters to run your conversions.
When the Data Converter receives a value for conversion, it passes through each Payload Converter in sequence until the converter that handles the data type does the conversion.
