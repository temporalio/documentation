## Debug

### Debug in a development environment

In addition to the normal development tools of logging and a debugger, you can also see what’s happening in your Workflow by using the [Web UI](/web-ui) or [`tctl`](/tctl-v1).

### Debug in a development production

You can debug production Workflows using:

- [Web UI](/web-ui)
- [`tctl`](/tctl-v1)
- [Replay](#replay)
- [Tracing](/application-development/observability#tracing)
- [Logging](/application-development/observability#logging)

You can debug and tune Worker performance with metrics and the [Worker performance guide](/application-development/worker-performance). For more information, see [Observability ▶️ Metrics](/application-development/observability#metrics) for setting up SDK metrics.

Debug Server performance with [Cloud metrics](/cloud/how-to-monitor-temporal-cloud-metrics) or [self-hosted Server metrics](/server/production-deployment#scaling-and-metrics).
