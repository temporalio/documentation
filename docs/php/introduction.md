:::info Try the Developer's guide

The majority of this information has moved into the [Developer's guide](/application-development/?lang=php).

However, if you can't find what you are looking for there, we recommend checking this doc set as well.

:::

## Quick start

1. Clone the [Temporal PHP SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php) or add it as dependency to your project using a dependency management tool like composer:

```composer
"require": {
    "temporal/sdk": ">=1.0",
  },
```

2. [Install and run the Temporal Server](/clusters/quick-install) using `docker compose`.

## Tutorials

- You should orient yourself to the Hello World with [the PHP Hello World Walkthrough](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/php/hello_world_in_php/).
- For those interested in distributed transactions, see the [Booking Saga Tutorial and code sample](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/php/booking_saga/).
- For a more non-trivial discussion of an application, see [the Subscription Tutorial](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/php/subscriptions/) or [browse the code directly](https://github.com/temporalio/subscription-workflow-project-template-php).

Much more detailed API samples can be viewed in [the Samples Repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php).
