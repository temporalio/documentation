## Quick start

You can clone the SDK from [https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java) or include it as a dependency with a dependency management tool such as [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). Copy the include scripts after you select your version from here: [https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.temporal/temporal-sdk](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.temporal/temporal-sdk)

Or, get started using an application template that already has the SDK as a dependency:

- [Money transfer application template](https://github.com/temporalio/money-transfer-project-template-java)
- ["Hello World!" application template](https://github.com/temporalio/hello-world-project-template-java)

Additional Java application samples are available here: [https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java)
