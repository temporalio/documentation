title: Implementing Workflows
---

A Workflow implementation implements a Workflow interface. Each time a new Workflow execution is started,
a new instance of the Workflow implementation object is created. Then, one of the methods
(depending on which Workflow type has been started) annotated with `#[WorkflowMethod]` is invoked. As soon as this method
returns, the Workflow execution is closed. While Workflow execution is open, it can receive calls to signal and query methods.
No additional calls to Workflow methods are allowed. The Workflow object is stateful, so query and signal methods
can communicate with the other parts of the Workflow through Workflow object fields.

## Workflow Implementation Constraints

Temporal uses the [Microsoft Azure Event Sourcing pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) to recover
the state of a Workflow object including its local variable values.

In essence, every time a Workflow state has to be restored, its code is re-executed from the beginning. When replaying, side
effects (such as Activity invocations) are ignored because they are already recorded in the Workflow event history.
When writing Workflow logic, the replay is not visible, so the code should be written since it executes only once.
This design puts the following constraints on the Workflow implementation:

- Do not use any mutable global variables because multiple instances of Workflows are executed in parallel.
- Do not call any non-deterministic functions like non seeded random or `UUID` directly from the Workflow code.

Always do the following in the Workflow implementation code:

- Don’t perform any IO or service calls as they are not usually deterministic. Use Activities for this.
- Only use `Workflow::now()` to get the current time inside a Workflow.
- Call `yield Workflow::timer()` instead of `sleep()`.
- Do not use any blocking SPL provided by PHP (i.e. `fopen`, `PDO`, etc) in **Workflow code**.
- Use `yield Workflow::getVersion()` when making any changes to the Workflow code. Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code
  might break already open Workflows.
- Don’t access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow execution path.
  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.

Workflow method arguments and return values are serializable to a byte array using the provided
[DataConverter](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html)
interface. The default implementation uses JSON serializer, but you can use any alternative serialization mechanism.

Make sure to annoate your `WorkflowMethod` using `ReturnType` to specify concrete return type.

> You can not use the default return type declaration as Workflow methods are generators.

The values passed to Workflows through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the execution history.
The entire execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow workers with every event that the Workflow logic needs to process.
A large execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.
Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data that you transfer via Activity invocation parameters or return values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.

## Calling Activities

`Workflow::newActivityStub` returns a client-side stub that implements an Activity interface.
It takes Activity type and Activity options as arguments. Activity options are needed only if some of the required
timeouts are not specified through the `#[ActivityMethod]` annotation.

Calling (via `yield`) a method on this interface invokes an Activity that implements this method.
An Activity invocation synchronously blocks until the Activity completes, fails, or times out. Even if Activity
execution takes a few months, the Workflow code still sees it as a single synchronous invocation.
It doesn't matter what happens to the processes that host the Workflow. The business logic code
just sees a single method call.

```php
class GreetingWorkflow implements GreetingWorkflowInterface
{
    private $greetingActivity;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
            GreetingActivityInterface::class,
            ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 seconds'))
        );
    }

    public function greet(string $name): \Generator
    {
        // This is a blocking call that returns only after the activity has completed.
        return yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hello', $name);
    }
}
```

If different Activities need different options, like timeouts or a task queue, multiple client-side stubs can be created
with different options.

```php
$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 seconds'))
);

$greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    ActivityOptions::new()->withStartToCloseTimeout(\DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 minutes'))
);
```

## Calling Activities Asynchronously

Sometimes Workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.

Invoking activity stub without the use of `yield` will return the activity result promise which can be resolved at later
moment. Calling `yield` on promise blocks until a result is available.

> Activity promise also exposes `then` method to construct promise chains. Read more about Promises [here](https://github.com/reactphp/promise).

Alternatively you can explicitly wrap your code (including `yield` constucts) using `Workflow::async` which will
execute nested code in parallel with main workflow code. Call `yeild` on Promise returned by `Workflow::async` to merge
execution result back to primary workflow method.

```php
public function greet(string $name): \Generator
{
    // Workflow::async runs it's activities and child workflows in a separate coroutine. Use keyword yield to merge
    // it back to parent process.

    $first = Workflow::async(
        function () use ($name) {
            $hello = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hello', $name);
            $bye = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Bye', $name);

            return $hello . '; ' . $bye;
        }
    );

    $second = Workflow::async(
        function () use ($name) {
            $hello = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hola', $name);
            $bye = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Chao', $name);

            return $hello . '; ' . $bye;
        }
    );

    // blocks until $first and $second complete
    return (yield $first) . "\n" . (yield $second);
}
```

## Awaits
Use specialized construct `Workflow::await` and `Workflow::awaitWithTimeout` to wait for Closure function become positive.

```php
$done = false;
Workflow::async(
    function () use (&$done) {
        $hello = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hello', $name);

        $done = true;
    }
);

// wait for $done to become true
yield Workflow::await(fn() => $done);
```

You can not use any activity, timer or child workflow invocation inside `await` or `awaitWithTimeout` method. However, 
you can use variables referenced by other coroutines.

## Timers
Use `Workflow::timer()` to yield long sleeps:

```php
yield Workflow::timer(300); // sleep for 5 minutes
```
