In this tutorial, we'll integrate all the knowledge gained from Core and Logging APIs in an end-to-end, complete demo application - which happens to be a Choose Your Own Adventure game that you can play on Discord or Slack!

This project will integrate and give context to your understanding of [Temporal SDK APIs](/docs/typescript/workflows): logging with Sinks, Activity dependency injection, Timer and Promise.race design patterns, Signals (and HTTP Servers for them), Polling patterns, and `continueAsNew` for indefinitely long running Workflows.

Let's dive in!

## Project Requirements

- On `/instructions`, posts instructions to Slack/Discord and pins the message
- Continuously runs the game until it reaches an end state:
  - Every day, post the current entry as a poll
  - Wait until the earlier of:
    - Every day, check the poll results
      - If there is consensus, determine next state
      - If no consensus, remind people to vote
    - Allow an admin to `/force` a choice any time
- Report important game updates to a specified logger

## Architecture

This project is based off the default [Hello World project](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/typescript/hello-world/) that is scaffolded out when you run `npx @temporalio/create@latest`.

### Overview

#### Worker

The Temporal Worker is set up in `src/worker.ts`.
It uses two common Temporal patterns:

- **Dependency Injection**: using the integration object created by `createIntegration` to provide APIs for the social platform being targeted (`Discord` or `Slack`) (see [Platforms](#platforms))
- **Logging Sinks**: providing a `logger.sink` method for the Workflows to log out to `console.log`

#### Workflows

The client in `src/client.ts` will ask Temporal to run two different Workflows:

1. **`instructions`**: Posts instructions to the social platform and pins the message
2. **`runGame`**: Continuously runs the game state until the game is finished

##### `runGame`

Each iteration of the game (so, daily), `runGame` goes through these steps:

1. If the entry has no options, the game is over
2. Post the current entry as a poll
3. Check and remind people to vote once a day until either...
   - ...a choice is made by consensus
   - ...an admin forces a choice
4. If the choice was forced by an admin, mention that
5. Continue with that chosen next step in the game

#### Platforms

The `platformFactory` function used in both workers and Workflows reads from `process.env` to return the `createIntegration` and `createServer` methods for the social platform being targeted.

##### Integrations

`createIntegration`: creates the client API used to send messages to the social platform.
For example, the Slack integration uses the [Slack Bolt SDK](https://slack.dev/bolt-js).

#### Servers

`createServer` creates the (generally Express) server that runs locally and receives webhook events from the social platform.
Both the Discord and Slack servers use Ngrok to expose a local port on the public web, so that a `/force` command configured on the platform sends a message, it can Signal to the Workflow.
