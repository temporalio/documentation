A typical Temporal project written in TypeScript consists of the following components:

```
project-root/
  activities/
      activity.ts
  workflows/
      workerflow.ts
  workers/
      worker.ts
  starter-script.ts
```

Activities cannot be in the same file as Workflows and must be separately registered.
Activities may be retried, so you may need to use [idempotency keys](https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency) for critical side effects.
