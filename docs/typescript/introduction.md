<CustomWarning>

This SDK and associated documentation is in an Alpha stage and may change at any time.
Alpha users should keep up to date with [the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md).

</CustomWarning>

The Temporal TypeScript SDK lets you write highly scalable and reliable long-running workflows without being a distributed systems expert.
It is designed with TypeScript-first developer experience in mind, but works equally well with JavaScript.

:::note ðŸš€ Commencing Launch Sequence

We are moving to Beta soon! Join:

- [Our launch meetup](https://temporal.io/meetup) on Nov 23
- [Our 2hr intro workshop](https://lu.ma/temporalintro) on Nov 30

And of course you can [join the #typescript-sdk channel](https://temporal.io/slack) to ask any questions as you get set up.
Design partners are already putting us in production and we are eager to hear your feedback.

## Getting started

Choose your own adventure:

<details>
<summary>
Run "Hello Temporal" in the cloud (~2 minutes)
</summary>

[Open our Samples repo in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/) and login to try out our Hello World example with no need for local Docker setup.

When you click on that link above and log in (there is a generous free tier), Gitpod will launch 4 terminals:

- Pane 1: Temporal Cluster
  - Left: [Temporal Server](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) - always running
  - Right: [Temporal Web](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/devtools/web-ui) and [Temporal `tctl` CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/devtools/tctl)
- Pane 2: Hello World
  - Left: [Temporal Worker](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/hello-world/src/worker.ts) - running and hot reloading
  - Right: [Temporal Client](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/hello-world/src/execute-workflow.ts) - run `npm run workflow`

It takes ~3 minutes for the Docker Compose setup to start up.
Once you have it up and running (Temporal Web should show the first Workflow Execution), you can use our [Hello World Walkthrough](/docs/typescript/hello-world) tutorial to orient you to the sample file structure.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Run "Hello Temporal" locally (~10 minutes)
</summary>

:::note Prerequisites

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Node.js 14+</strong>: This project requires Node.js version 14 or later.
</summary>

macOS users: Brew installation of Node.js versions 15.0 to 16.4 does not work with the SDK; instead install the latest Node.js version (16.4.1+) or use nvm

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade node
```

-- OR --

```bash
nvm use 16
```

If you donâ€™t have `nvm` ([Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)), you can [install](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) it with:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Temporal Server</strong>: make sure it is running locally!
</summary>

Run Temporal Server (requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git temporal
cd temporal
docker-compose up
```

If you want to run Temporal without Docker, DataDog has created an experimental project called [temporalite](https://github.com/DataDog/temporalite) you can try.

</details>

:::

### Step 1: Create a new project

Use the [package initializer](/docs/typescript/package-initializer) to create a new project:

```bash
npx @temporalio/create@latest ./example
cd example
```

This will set up with [the basic Hello World sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/hello-world) using our [Package Initializer](/docs/typescript/package-initializer) (think of it like `create-temporal-app`!)

<!-- commented out for now as it seems we no longer need this
<details>
<summary>Provided you have the `node-gyp` prerequisite, this will take a couple of minutes.
</summary>

`npx` triggers native module compilation which might take a while, and `npm` 7 hides the compilation output so it may appear that the installation is stuck. To see the compilation progress, run `export NPM_CONFIG_FOREGROUND_SCRIPTS=true` first.

</details> -->

### Step 2: Run your Workflow

Run the Worker:

```bash
# this runs ts-node src/worker.ts with nodemon to auto-reload on changes
$ npm run start.watch
```

<details>
<summary>Expected Terminal Output</summary>

```bash
# this runs ts-node src/worker.ts with nodemon to auto-reload on changes
$ npm run start.watch

> temporal-hello-world@0.1.0 start.watch
> nodemon src/worker.ts

[nodemon] 2.0.13
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): src/**/*

> If this step fails, make sure you have the correct version of Node and other prerequisites listed above.

Then start your Workflow:

```bash
$ npm run workflow # runs ts-node src/exec-workflow.ts
Hello, Temporal! # success!
```

This "Hello, Temporal!" message comes from the combination of:

- [`execute-workflow.ts`](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/hello-world/src/execute-workflow.ts) passing `'Temporal'` as an argument to the Workflow.
- The [Workflow](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/hello-world/src/workflows.ts) passing the argument to the Activity.
- The [Activity](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/hello-world/src/activities.ts) taking the argument as `name` and returning `Hello, ${name}!`.

<details>
<summary>Viewing your Workflow Execution in Temporal Web
</summary>

You can verify execution in Temporal Web (available at [`localhost:8088`](http://localhost:8088/) on the default [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)):

## Next Steps

For a full code walkthrough of our Hello World example, see our [Hello World documentation](/docs/typescript/hello-world).

If you want an example of what it's like to integrate Temporal into an existing full-stack app, check our [Next.js One-Click Buy Tutorial](/docs/typescript/nextjs-tutorial).

<details>
<summary>Read through the core API docs (~20 minutes)
</summary>

These are the essential pages to have a passing knowledge of our Core APIs:

- [Workflows](/docs/typescript/workflows): How to write Temporal's core orchestration code
  - Workflows use [Activities](/docs/typescript/activities) to act on the outside world (e.g. call an API with retries and timeouts, or access the filesystem)
  - see [Workflow APIs](/docs/typescript/workflows) for Signals, Queries, Timers, Child Workflows, Infinite Workflows, and more!
- [Workers and Task Queues](/docs/typescript/workers): How Workflows and Activities are routed to and executed on machines you control
- [Clients](/docs/typescript/clients): How to start, signal, query, cancel, or otherwise handle Workflows.
