The Temporal TypeScript SDK lets you write highly scalable and reliable long-running Workflows without being a distributed systems expert.
It is designed with TypeScript-first developer experience in mind, but works equally well with JavaScript.

You can view:

- [Code samples on GitHub](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript)
  - Fastest way to try these out is in the browser [![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-908a85?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/) ([90-second demo](https://youtu.be/FdEQQC9EdfU))
- [Searchable full API reference](https://typescript.temporal.io)

## Getting started

Choose your own adventure:

<details>
<summary>
Run "Hello Temporal" in the cloud (~2 minutes)
</summary>

[Open our Samples repo in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/) and login to try out our Hello World example with no need for local Docker setup.

When you click on that link above and log in (there is a generous free tier), Gitpod will launch 4 terminals:

- Pane 1: Temporal Cluster
  - Left: [Temporal Server](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) - always running
  - Right: [Temporal Web](/web-ui) and [Temporal `tctl` CLI](/tctl-v1)
- Pane 2: Hello World
  - Left: [Temporal Worker](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/hello-world/src/worker.ts) - running and hot reloading
  - Right: [Temporal Client](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/hello-world/src/client.ts) - run `npm run workflow`

It takes ~3 minutes for the Docker Compose setup to start up.
Once you have it up and running (Temporal Web should show the first Workflow Execution), you can use our [Hello World Walkthrough](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/typescript/hello_world_in_typescript/) tutorial to orient you to the sample file structure.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Run "Hello Temporal" locally (~10 minutes)
</summary>

:::note Prerequisites

<strong>Node.js 14+</strong>: this project requires Node.js version 14 or later.

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Temporal Server</strong>: make sure it is running locally!
</summary>

Run Temporal Server (requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git temporal
cd temporal
docker compose up
```

If you want to run Temporal without Docker, [Temporalite](https://github.com/temporalio/temporalite) is a distribution of Temporal that runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies.

</details>

:::

### Step 1: Create a new project

Use the [package initializer](/typescript/package-initializer) to create a new project:

```bash
npx @temporalio/create@latest ./example
cd example
```

This will set up with [the basic Hello World sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/hello-world) using our [Package Initializer](/typescript/package-initializer) (think of it like `create-temporal-app`!)

### Step 2: Run your Workflow

Run the Worker:

```bash
# this runs ts-node src/worker.ts with nodemon to auto-reload on changes
$ npm run start.watch
```

<details>
<summary>Expected Terminal Output</summary>

```bash
# this runs ts-node src/worker.ts with nodemon to auto-reload on changes
$ npm run start.watch

> temporal-hello-world@0.1.0 start.watch
> nodemon src/worker.ts

[nodemon] 2.0.13
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): src/**/*

> If this step fails, make sure you have the correct version of Node and other prerequisites listed above.

Then start your Workflow:

```bash
$ npm run workflow # runs ts-node src/client.ts
Hello, Temporal! # success!
```

This "Hello, Temporal!" message comes from the combination of:

- [`client.ts`](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/hello-world/src/client.ts) passing `'Temporal'` as an argument to the Workflow.
- The [Workflow](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/hello-world/src/workflows.ts) passing the argument to the Activity.
- The [Activity](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/hello-world/src/activities.ts) taking the argument as `name` and returning `Hello, ${name}!`.

<details>
<summary>Viewing your Workflow Execution in Temporal Web
</summary>

You can verify execution in Temporal Web (available at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) on the default [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)):

## Next Steps

For a full code walkthrough of our Hello World example, see our [Hello World documentation](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/typescript/hello_world_in_typescript/).

If you want an example of what it's like to integrate Temporal into an existing full-stack app, check our [Next.js One-Click Buy Tutorial](/typescript/nextjs-tutorial).

<details>
<summary>Read through the core API docs (~20 minutes)
</summary>

These are the essential pages to have a passing knowledge of our Core APIs:

- [Workflows](/typescript/workflows): How to write Temporal's core orchestration code
  - Workflows use [Activities](/typescript/activities) to act on the outside world (e.g. call an API with retries and timeouts, or access the filesystem)
  - see [Workflow APIs](/typescript/workflows) for Signals, Queries, Timers, Child Workflows, Infinite Workflows, and more!
- [Workers and Task Queues](/typescript/workers): How Workflows and Activities are routed to and executed on machines you control
- [Clients](/typescript/clients): How to start, signal, query, cancel, or otherwise handle Workflows.
