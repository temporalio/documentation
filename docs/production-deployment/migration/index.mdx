There are currently 2 supported methods of migrating workflows to Temporal Cloud:
1. [Manually](/production-deployments/migration/manual) - This process involves building resources within Temporal Cloud and updating clients and workflows to utilize these resources.
2. [Automatically](/production-deployments/migration/automated) - This process enables seamless transitions from self-hosted Temporal instances to Temporal Cloud.
