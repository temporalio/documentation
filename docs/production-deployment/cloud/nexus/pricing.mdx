One Action to start or cancel a Nexus Operation in the caller Namespace.

The underlying Temporal primitives (Workflows, Actions, Signals, â€¦) created by a Nexus Operation handler result in the normal Actions for those primitives.

No Action results for handling or retrying the Nexus Operation itself.

See [Pricing] for additional details.
