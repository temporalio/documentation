:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview).
Learn why you should use Nexus in the [evaluation guide](/evaluate/nexus).

:::

The pricing for [Temporal Nexus](/evaluate/nexus) is:

- **One Action to start or cancel a Nexus Operation** in the caller Namespace.
  The underlying Temporal primitives such as Workflows, Activities, Signals created by a Nexus Operation handler (directly or indirectly) result in the normal Actions for those primitives.
  This includes retries for underlying Temporal primitives like Activities.
- **No Action results for handling or retrying the Nexus Operation itself**.
  However, while the retry of the Nexus Operation incurs no charge, any billable action initiated by the handler (such as an Activity) will be charged if it fails and is subsequently retried.

See [Pricing](/cloud/pricing) for additional details.
