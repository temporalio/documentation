:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is now [Generally Available](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#general-availability).
Learn why you should use Nexus in the [evaluation guide](/evaluate/nexus).

:::

Temporal Cloud has default limits for several aspects of Nexus.
Many of these defaults are configurable, so if you need them changed please open a support ticket.

## Rate Limiting

Nexus requests (commands, polling) are counted as part of the overall Namespace RPS limit in both the caller and handler Namespaces.
Default Namespace RPS limits are set at 1600 and automatically adjust based on recent usage (over prior 7 days).

## Operational Limits

Nexus has operational limits for thing like the maximum number of Nexus Endpoints and the maximum request handler timeout.

### Max Nexus Endpoints

By default, each account is provisioned with a max of 10 Nexus Endpoints.
You can request further increases beyond the initial 10 Endpoint limit by opening a support ticket.

### Workflow Max Nexus Operations

A single Workflow Execution can have a maximum of 30 in-flight Nexus Operations.

See the Nexus Encyclopedia entry for [additional details](/workflow-execution-nexus-operation-limits).

### Nexus Request Handler Timeout

Nexus Operation handlers have less than 10 seconds to process a single Nexus start or cancel request.
Handlers should observe the context deadline and ensure they do not exceed it.
This includes fully processing a synchronous Nexus operation and starting an asynchronous Nexus operation, for example one that starts a Workflow.
If a handler doesn’t respond within a context deadline, a context deadline exceeded error will be tracked in the caller Workflow’s pending Nexus operations, and the Nexus Machinery will retry the Nexus request with an exponential backoff policy.

### Nexus Operation Maximum Duration

Each Nexus Operation has a maximum ScheduleToClose duration of 60 days, which is most applicable to asynchronous Nexus Operations that are completed with an asynchronous callback using a separate Nexus request from the handler back to the caller Namespace.
The 60 day maximum is a limit we will look to increase at some point in the future.
While the caller of a Nexus Operation can configure the ScheduleToClose duration to be shorter than 60 days, the maximum duration can not be extended beyond 60 days and will be capped by the server to 60 days.
