Nexus Services are exposed from a Nexus Endpoint that is created in the Nexus API Registry.
Nexus Endpoints include service documentation that enables others to use the Nexus Services provided by a Nexus Endpoint, for example from caller Workflows.

Temporal has built-in Nexus Machinery that performs the low-level [Nexus RPC](/glossary#nexus-rpc) operations on the wire and provides an integrated Temporal SDK experience to create Nexus Services in a handler Worker and use them from a caller Workflow through a Nexus Endpoint.

In Temporal Cloud, the Nexus Machinery routes Nexus requests across Namespace boundaries through a secure mTLS Envoy mesh, where they are sync matched to a Worker in the handler Namespace, which processes the Nexus request.

Nexus caller Workflows will send commands to Temporal Cloud to schedule or cancel a Nexus Operation in the caller Namespace.
Handler Workers will poll for Nexus tasks in the handler Namespace.

Nexus Operation handlers can be implemented as [Asynchronous Operations](/nexus/services-operations#asynchronous-operation-lifecycle) or [Synchronous Operations](/nexus/services-operations#asynchronous-operation-lifecycle), using Temporal SDK builders that enable running a Nexus Service in a Worker, typically the same Worker as the underlying primitives the Nexus Service abstracts.

For example, an asynchronous operation that starts a Workflow in a different Namespace:

Unlike a traditional RPC, an arbitrary-duration Nexus Operation has an identity (ID) that lasts beyond the process lifetimes of the caller and handler, and can be used to re-attach to a long-lived Nexus Operation, for example one backed by a Temporal Workflow.

When you schedule a Nexus Operation in a caller Workflow, a command is sent to Temporal to schedule the Operation, and then the Temporal Nexus Machinery is responsible for making the Nexus RPC calls on your behalf.
This means you don’t have to use Nexus RPC directly, only the Temporal SDK along with a Temporal Service.

Similar to executing an Activity, to execute a Nexus Operation from a Workflow:

1. Caller Workflow will schedule a Nexus Operation using the Temporal SDK, which sends a `ScheduleNexusOperation` command in the existing `RespondWorkflowTaskCompleted` RPC which is recorded as `NexusOperationScheduled` in the caller’s Workflow history.
2. Nexus handler Worker uses the Temporal SDK to `PollNexusTaskQueue` and process the Nexus request.
3. Nexus handler Worker sends a `RespondNexusTaskCompleted` through the SDK, with the result of the Nexus request, which may be one of: Started, Completed, Failed, TimedOut, or Canceled. See [Nexus Operation Events](/references/events) for more info
4. Caller Workflow then processes the Nexus Operation event through `PollWorkflowTaskQueue`.

See the [Temporal Nexus](/nexus) encyclopedia entry for more details. 

## Access Control

Like Namespaces, a Nexus Endpoint is an account-scoped resource that is global within a Temporal Cloud account. 
Any Developer role (or higher) in an account, who is also a Namespace Admin on the endpoint’s target Namespace, can manage (create, update, or delete) a Nexus Endpoint. 
All users with a Read-only role (or higher) in an account, can view and browse the full list of Endpoints.

Runtime access from a Workflow in a caller Namespace to a Nexus Endpoint is controlled by an allowlist policy (of caller Namespaces) for each Endpoint in the Nexus API registry.
Workers authenticate with Temporal Cloud as they do today with mTLS certificates or API keys as allowed by the Namespace configuration.
In Temporal Cloud, Nexus requests are sent from the caller’s Namespace to the handler’s Namespace over a secure multi-region mTLS Envoy mesh.

See [Nexus Security](/nexus/security) for additional details.

## Automatic Retries

Once the caller Workflow schedules an Operation with the caller’s Temporal Service, the caller’s Nexus Machinery keeps trying to start the Operation, with automatic retries and exponential backoff. 
If a Nexus Operation returns a retryable error when attempting to start, the Operation it will be retried up to the default Retry Policy’s maximum attempts and expiration interval.

See [Nexus Automatic Retries](/nexus/services-operations#automatic-retries) for additional details.

## Failure Handling

In a Nexus Operation handler, you can throw a Nexus HandlerError with an associated Nexus HandlerErrorType. 
If an unknown Error is thrown from a Nexus handler, it is treated as a retryable 500 InternalServerError, that Nexus will attempt to retry until the Schedule-to-Close Timeout is exceeded (which is capped at 60 days max by the server). See [Nexus Operation duration limits].

All retryable errors are automatically retried by the Nexus Machinery, as discussed in [Automatic Retries](/nexus/services-operations#automatic-retries). 
If a non-retryable error is returned from the handler, then it is returned as a Nexus Operation Failure to the caller Workflow.
The list of [non-retryable errors](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/13d6cd8cf7a4ba0c4660cf98f672bbd645dca3e7/components/nexusoperations/executors.go#L659) is currently not configurable.

A Nexus Operation Failure is delivered to the Workflow Execution when a Nexus Operation fails.
It contains information about the failure and the Nexus Operation Execution; for example, the Nexus Operation name and Nexus Operation Id.
The reason for the failure is in the message and in the underlying cause is typically an Application Error or a Canceled Error.

:::note
This differs from how Activities and Workflows handle errors and retries:
- [Errors in Activities](https://docs.temporal.io/references/failures#errors-in-activities)
- [Non-retryable errors](https://docs.temporal.io/references/failures#non-retryable)

See [Failures](/references/failures) and [Automatic Retries](/nexus/services-operations#automatic-retries) for additional details.

## Execution Semantics

### At-least-once Execution Semantics and Idempotency

Nexus Operations, like Activities, have at-least-once execution semantics.
The caller's Nexus Machinery will keep trying to start the Operation multiple times. 
The Nexus Operation handler should be idempotent just like Activities should be idempotent as a general rule. 
It's not required in all cases, but highly recommended in general.

### At-most-once Execution Semantics through an Underlying WorkflowIdReusePolicy

To dedupe work and get at-most-once execution semantics, an Operation can start a Workflow with a WorkflowIdReusePolicy of RejectDuplicates which only allows one Workflow Execution per Workflow Id within a Namespace for the retention period.
