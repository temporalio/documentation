#### Operations

##### Execution Debugging

Execution debugging with Nexus includes end-to-end executions that span:

* caller Workflow  
* one or more Nexus Operations that are routed within and across namespaces  
* underlying Temporal primitives created by a Nexus Operation handler like a Workflow

Multi-level Nexus calls are supported:

* workflow A \-\> nexus op 1 \-\> workflow B \-\> nexus op 2 \-\> workflow C

In Public Preview we aim to provide a Nexus debugging experience at least as good as Child Workflows, and aim to provide a much better experience over time.

###### *Underlying Workflow ID is returned as the Nexus Operation ID*

When a Nexus Operation is started by a caller workflow that is processed by a Temporal SDK NewWorkflowRunOperation handler, the underlying Workflow ID is returned as the Nexus Operation ID which is reflected in the Nexus Operation Started event in the caller’s workflow history.  

This can be used to search the handler’s namespace for that Workflow ID:  

This may also be done using: `temporal workflow show –detailed`

```

```

Which can then be searched using: `temporal workflow list –query`.

However this requires knowing the Endpoint’s target namespace and manual steps, which is why we’ve created [bi-directional linking for Nexus Operations] to navigate forwards and backwards across workflow event histories, via the Nexus Operations and underlying Temporal primitives they may create.

###### *Pending Operations*

Similar to pending Activities, pending Nexus Operations are displayed in the Workflow details page and using: `temporal workflow describe`.

For example from the Temporal UI:  
![][image13]

For example from the `temporal` CLI:

```
temporal workflow describe

Pending Nexus Operations: 1

  Endpoint                 myendpoint
  Service                  my-hello-service
  Operation                echo
  OperationID
  State                    BackingOff

  LastAttemptFailure       {"message":"unexpected response status: \"500 Internal Server Error\": internal error","applicationFailureInfo":{}}
```

###### *Pending Callbacks*

Nexus callbacks are sent from the handler’s namespace to the caller’s namespace to complete an asynchronous Nexus Operation. These show up in the UI and using: `temporal workflow describe`.

For example, from the Temporal UI:  
![][image14]

For example, from the `temporal` CLI:

```
temporal workflow describe
