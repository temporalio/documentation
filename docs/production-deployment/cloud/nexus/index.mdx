:::

## Global Nexus Registry

The Nexus Registry in Temporal Cloud is scoped to an Account.
Workers in any Namespace can host Nexus Services for others to use within an Account.

## Built-in access controls

Temporal Cloud has built-in Endpoint access controls to restrict which callers can use a Nexus Endpoint.

## Audit logging

Temporal Cloud supports audit log streaming for Nexus Registry actions to create, update, or delete Endpoints.

## Multi-region connectivity

Nexus requests in Temporal Cloud are routed across Namespaces using a global mTLS-secured Envoy mesh.
Built-in Nexus Machinery provides reliable at-least-once execution and Workflow policy can deduplicate requests for exactly-once execution, even across multi-region boundaries.
