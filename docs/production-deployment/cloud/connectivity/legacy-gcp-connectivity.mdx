Pre-release experience for existing private connectivity users - could link to a Google doc vs having a permanent public docs link

Customers who set up PrivateLink connectivity via Temporal support may have 0 connectivity rules for each namespace. That means:
* Namespace IS DEFINITELY publicly accessible
* Namespace MAY BE accessible over PL

When you enable connectivity rules, it will block traffic that does not have a corresponding rule

What does a customer do in this case?
* If you donâ€™t want to enforce private connectivity, no action is required
* If you have 1 PL AND you want to enforce private connectivity only:
  * Add a CR for your PL for all namespaces
  * Now all namespaces will be only accessible via PL
* If you have multiple PL AND you want to enforce private connectivity only:
  * You need to determine which workers are using which connection to connect to which namespace
  * Add a CR for each PL and the namespaces it should have access to
  * Now all namespaces will be only accessible via PL
