## Temporal Cloud IP addresses

The specific IP addresses for Temporal Cloud resources are subject to change at any time. Temporal Cloud resources may use any IPs within the IP ranges published by the relevant cloud provider.

If you need to limit outbound access from your client network, we recommend using [AWS PrivateLink or GCP Private Services Connect](/cloud/connectivity#private-network-connectivity-for-namespaces) instead of IP allowlisting.

:::warning Do not allowlist specific IP addresses

**Temporal Cloud IPs are not static and may change without notice.** 

Do not allowlist specific IP addresses you see Temporal Cloud services using at a point in time, as this **will cause an outage** when those IPs change. Your clients will not be able to connect to Temporal Cloud.

If you have to allowlist IP ranges, you must allowlist the entire cloud provider IP range:
- [AWS IP address ranges](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json)
- [GCP IP address ranges](https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json)
