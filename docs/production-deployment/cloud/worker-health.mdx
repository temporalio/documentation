This page is a guide to the following:

- [Configuring minimal alerts](#minimal-alerts)
- [How to detect a backlog of Tasks](#detect-task-backlog)
- [How to detect greedy Worker resources](#detect-greedy-workers)
- [How to detect misconfigured Workers](#detect-misconfigured-workers)
- [How to configure Sticky cache](#configure-sticky-cache)

## Minimal alerts {#minimal-alerts}

These alerts should be configured and understood first to gain intelligence into your application health and behaviors.

1. Create monitors and alerts for Schedule-To-Start latency SDK metrics (both [Workflow Executions](/references/sdk-metrics#workflow_task_schedule_to_start_latency) and [Activity Executions](/references/sdk-metrics#activity_schedule_to_start_latency)).
   See [Detect Task backlog section](#detect-task-backlog) to explore [sample queries](#prometheus-query-samples) and appropriate responses that accompany these values.

- Alert at >200ms for your p99 value
- Plot >100ms for your p95 value

2. Create a [Grafana](/cloud/metrics/prometheus-grafana) panel called Sync Match Rate.
   See the [Sync Match Rate section](#sync-match-rate) to explore example queries and appropriate responses that accompany these values.

- Alert at \<95% for your p99 value
- Plot \<99% for your p95 value

3. Create a [Grafana](/cloud/metrics/prometheus-grafana) panel called Poll Success Rate.
   See the [Detect greedy Workers section](#detect-greedy-workers) for example queries and appropriate responses that accompany these values.

- Alert at \<90% for your p99 value
- Plot \<95% for your p95 value

The following alerts build on the above to dive deeper into specific potential causes for Worker related issues you might be experiencing.

1. Create monitors and alerts for the [temporal_worker_task_slots_available](/references/sdk-metrics#worker_task_slots_available) SDK metric.
   See the [Detect misconfigured Workers section](#detect-misconfigured-workers) for appropriate responses based on the value.

- Alert at 0 for your p99 value

2. Create monitors for the [temporal_sticky_cache_size](/references/sdk-metrics#sticky_cache_size) SDK metric.
   See the [Configure Sticky Cache section](#configure-sticky-cache) for more details on this configuration.

- Plot at \{value\} > \{WorkflowCacheSize.Value\}

3. Create monitors for the [temporal_sticky_cache_total_forced_eviction](/references/sdk-metrics#sticky_cache_total_forced_eviction) SDK metric.
   This metric is available in the Go SDK, and the Java SDK only.
   See the [Configure Sticky Cache section](#configure-sticky-cache) for more details and appropriate responses.

- Alert at >\{predetermined_high_number\}

## Detect Task Backlog {#detect-task-backlog}

**How to detect a backlog of Tasks.**

Metrics to monitor:

- **SDK metric**: [workflow_task_schedule_to_start_latency](/references/sdk-metrics#workflow_task_schedule_to_start_latency)
- **SDK metric**: [activity_schedule_to_start_latency](/references/sdk-metrics#activity_schedule_to_start_latency)
- **Temporal Cloud metric**: [temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count)
- **Temporal Cloud metric**: [temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_sync_count](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_sync_count)

### Schedule To Start latency

The Schedule-To-Start metric represents how long Tasks are staying, unprocessed, in the Task Queues.
But differently, it is the time between when a Task is enqueued and when it is picked up by a Worker.
This time being long (likely) means that your Workers can't keep up — either increase the number of Workers (if the host load is already high) or increase the number of pollers per Worker.

If your Schedule-To-Start latency alert fires or appears high, cross-check this with the [Sync Match Rate](#sync-match-rate) to determine if you need to change your Worker or fleet, or if you need to contact Temporal Cloud support.
If your Sync Match Rate is low, you can contact Temporal Cloud support.

The schedule_to_start_latency SDK metric for both [Workflow Executions](/references/sdk-metrics#workflow_task_schedule_to_start_latency) and [Activity Executions](/references/sdk-metrics#activity_schedule_to_start_latency) should have alerts.

#### Prometheus query samples

**Workflow Task Latency, 99th percentile**

```
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(temporal_workflow_task_schedule_to_start_latency_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, namespace, task_queue))
```

**Workflow Task Latency, average**

```
sum(increase(temporal_workflow_task_schedule_to_start_latency_seconds_sum[5m])) by (namespace, task_queue)
/
sum(increase(temporal_workflow_task_schedule_to_start_latency_seconds_count[5m])) by (namespace, task_queue)
```

**Activity Task Latency, 99th percentile**

```
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(temporal_activity_schedule_to_start_latency_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, namespace, task_queue))
```

**Activity Task Latency, average**

```
sum(increase(temporal_activity_schedule_to_start_latency_seconds_sum[5m])) by (namespace, task_queue)
/
sum(increase(temporal_activity_schedule_to_start_latency_seconds_count[5m])) by (namespace, task_queue)
```

**Target**

This latency should be a very low value -- close to zero.
Anything else indicates bottlenecking.

### Sync Match Rate {#sync-match-rate}

The Sync Match Rate measures the rate of Tasks that can be delivered to Workers without having to be persisted (Workers are up and available to pick them up) to the rate of all delivered Tasks.

**Calculate Sync Match Rate**

```
temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_sync_count ÷ temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count = N
```

#### Prometheus query samples

**sync_match_rate query**

```
sum by(temporal_namespace) (
    rate(
        temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_sync_count{temporal_namespace=~"$namespace"}[5m]
    )
)
/
sum by(temporal_namespace) (
    rate(
        temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count{temporal_namespace=~"$namespace"}[5m]
    )
)
```

**Target**

The Sync Match Rate should be at least >95%, but preferably >99%.

**Interpretation**

There is not enough or under-powered resources.
If the Schedule-To-Start latency is high and the Sync Match Rate is high, the TaskQueue is experiencing a backlog of Tasks.

There are three typical causes for this:

- There are not enough Workers to perform work
- Each Worker is either under resourced, or is misconfigured, to handle enough work
- There is congestion caused by the environment (eg., network) hosting the Worker(s) and Temporal Cloud.

**Actions**

Consider the following:

- Increasing either the number of available Workers, OR
- Verifying that your Worker hosts are appropriately resourced, OR
- Increasing the Worker configuration value for concurrent pollers for Workers/Task executions (if your Worker resources can accommodate the increased load), OR
  - TypeScript: [Workflows](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#maxconcurrentworkflowtaskexecutions)
  - Golang: [Workflows](/develop/go/core-application#maxconcurrentworkflowtaskpollers)
- Doing some combination of the above

**Temporal Cloud bottleneck**

If the Schedule-To-Start latency is _high_ and the Sync Match Rate is also _low_, Temporal Cloud could very well be the bottleneck and you should reach out via support channels for us to confirm.

**Caveat**

If you are setting the [Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-start-timeout) value in your Activity Options, it will skew your observations.
You should avoid setting a Schedule-To-Start Timeout when profiling latency.

## Detect greedy Worker resources {#detect-greedy-workers}

**How to detect greedy Worker resources.**

You can have too many Workers.
If you see the Poll Success Rate showing low numbers, you might have too many resources polling Temporal Cloud.

Metrics to monitor:

- **Temporal Cloud metric**: [temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count)
- **Temporal Cloud metric**: [temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_sync_count](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_sync_count)
- **Temporal Cloud metric**: [temporal_cloud_v0_poll_timeout_count](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_poll_timeout_count)
- **SDK metric**: [temporal_workflow_task_schedule_to_start_latency](/references/sdk-metrics#workflow_task_schedule_to_start_latency)
- **SDK metric**: [temporal_activity_schedule_to_start_latency](/references/sdk-metrics#activity_schedule_to_start_latency)

**Calculate Poll Success Rate**

```
(temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count + temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_sync_count)(temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count + temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_sync_count + temporal_cloud_v0_poll_timeout_count)
```

**Target**

Poll Success Rate should be >90% in most cases of systems with a steady load.
For high volume and low latency, try to target >95%.

**Interpretation**

There may be too Many Workers.

If you see the followign at the same time then you might have too many Workers:

- Low poll success rate, AND
- Low `schedule_to_start_latency`, AND
- Low Worker hosts resource utilization

**Actions**

Consider sizing down your Workers by either:

- Reducing the number of Workers polling the impacted Task Queue, OR
- Reducing the concurrent pollers per Worker, OR
- Both of the above

#### Prometheus query samples

**poll_success_rate query**

```
(
    (
        sum by(temporal_namespace) (
          rate(
            temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count{temporal_namespace=~"$namespace"}[5m]
          )
        )
      +
        sum by(temporal_namespace) (
          rate(
            temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_sync_count{temporal_namespace=~"$namespace"}[5m]
          )
        )
    )
  /
    (
        (
            sum by(temporal_namespace) (
              rate(
                temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count{temporal_namespace=~"$namespace"}[5m]
              )
            )
          +
            sum by(temporal_namespace) (
              rate(
                temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_sync_count{temporal_namespace=~"$namespace"}[5m]
              )
            )
        )
      +
        sum by(temporal_namespace) (
          rate(
            temporal_cloud_v0_poll_timeout_count{temporal_namespace=~"$namespace"}[5m]
          )
        )
    )
)
```

## Detect misconfigured Workers {#detect-misconfigured-workers}

**How to detect misconfigured Workers.**

The configuration of your Workers can negatively affect the efficiency of your Task processing as well.

Metrics to monitor:

- **SDK metric**: [temporal_worker_task_slots_available](/references/sdk-metrics#worker_task_slots_available)
- **SDK metric**: [sticky_cache_size](/references/sdk-metrics#sticky_cache_size)
- **SDK metric**: [sticky_cache_total_forced_eviction](/references/sdk-metrics#sticky_cache_total_forced_eviction)

**Execution Size Configuration**

The `maxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize` and `maxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize` define the number of total available slots for the Worker.
If this is set too low, the Worker would not be able to keep up processing Tasks.

**Target**

The `temporal_worker_task_slots_available` metric should always be >0.

#### Prometheus query samples

**Over Time**

```
avg_over_time(temporal_worker_task_slots_available{namespace="$namespace",worker_type="WorkflowWorker"}[10m])
```

**Current Time**

```
temporal_worker_task_slots_available{namespace="default", worker_type="WorkflowWorker", task_queue="$task_queue_name"}
```

**Interpretation**

You are likely experiencing a Task backlog if you are seeing inadequate slot counts frequently.
The work is not getting processed as fast as it should/can.

**Action**

Increase the `maxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize` and `maxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize` values and keep an eye on your Worker resource metrics (CPU utilization, etc) to make sure you haven't created a new issue.

### Configure Sticky Execution Cache {#configure-sticky-cache}

A Sticky Execution is a when a Worker Entity caches the Workflow Execution Event History and creates a dedicated Task Queue to listen on.

**How to configure your Workflow Sticky cache.**

The `WorkflowCacheSize` should always be greater than the `sticky_cache_size` metric value.
Additionally, you can watch `sticky_cache_total_forced_eviction` for unusually high numbers that are likely an indicator of inefficiency, since Workflows are being evicted from the cache.

**Target**

The `sticky_cache_size` should report less than or equal to your `WorkflowCacheSize` value.
Also, sticky_cache_total_forced_eviction should not be reporting high numbers (relative).

**Action**

If you see a high eviction count, verify there are no other inefficiencies in your Worker configuration or resource provisioning (backlog).
If you see the cache size metric exceed the `WorkflowCacheSize`, increase this value if your Worker resources can accommodate it or provision more Workers.
Finally, take time to review this document and see if this document further addresses potential cache issues.

#### Prometheus query samples

**Sticky Cache Size**

```
max_over_time(temporal_sticky_cache_size{namespace="$namespace"}[10m])
```

**Sticky Cache Evictions**

```
rate(temporal_sticky_cache_total_forced_eviction_total{namespace="$namespace"}[5m]))
```
