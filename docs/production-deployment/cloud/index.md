[Temporal Cloud](https://temporal.io/cloud) is software as a service (SaaS) infra that supervises your durable applications written with a [Temporal SDK](/dev-guide/sdks#).

It is a hosted and fully managed Temporal environment that provides an alternative to deploying and operating your own [Temporal Cluster](/self-hosted-guide/introduction#).

Temporal Cloud is offered in units of isolation known as [Namespaces](/namespaces).
You can provision and use one or more Cloud Namespaces.
A typical use case is to use separate Namespaces as development, testing, integration, staging, and production environments for an application.
