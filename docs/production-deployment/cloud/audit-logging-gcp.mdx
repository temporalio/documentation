## Manual Setup Prerequisites

:::note

These steps are only needed for manual setup. If you use Terraform for your deployment, you don't need
to complete these prerequisites.

:::

Before configuring the manual Audit log sink, complete the following steps in Google Cloud:

1. Create a Pub/Sub topic and make a note of its topic name, for example, "test-
   auditlog".
1. Set up a service account in the same project in Google Cloud and follow the instructions in the
   Temporal Cloud UI to configure the permissions for that account.

## Create an Audit Log sink

1. In the Temporal Cloud UI, select **Settings**.
1. On the **Settings** page, select **Audit Logging**.
1. In the **Audit Logging** card, select **Set Up Audit Log Integration**.
1. On the Set Up Audit Logs Integration page, select **Pub/Sub**.
1. In the **Service account email** field, enter the service account email you created in the prerequisites.
1. In the **Topic name** field, enter the topic name of the Pub/Sub topic you created in the prerequisites.
1. There are two ways to configure the service account to write to the Pub/Sub sink. Select **Manual** to configure
   the account manually, or **Deploy with Terraform** to use Terraform. If you use Terraform, you don't need to
   complete the prerequisite steps above.
1. Follow the instructions in the Temporal Cloud UI for the method you chose.
1. Click **Create** to configure the audit log. This may take a few minutes.
