## **Prerequisites**

Before configuring the Audit log Sink, please complete the following steps in Google Cloud:

1. Create a PubSub topic and take note of its topic name, for example, "test-
auditlog"
    1. If you wish to enable customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK), do so
2. Record the GCP Project ID that owns the topic
3. Set up a service account in the same project that trusts the Temporal internal service account to let Temporal write information to your account. Follow the instructions in the Temporal Cloud UI, there are two ways to set up this service account:
    1. Input the service account ID, GCP project ID and PubSub topic name
        1. Follow the instructions, manually set up a new service account
        2. Use the [Terraform template](https://github.com/temporalio/terraform-modules/tree/main/modules/gcp-sink-sa) to create the service account
