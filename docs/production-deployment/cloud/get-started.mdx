Follow these steps to start using Temporal Cloud:

**1. Sign up for Temporal Cloud!**

To create a Temporal Cloud account, either:

- Sign up [on our site](https://temporal.io/get-cloud); or
- Subscribe at the AWS Marketplace for [Temporal Cloud Pay-As-You-Go](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-hbcjz7wcl2mvu).

Signing up on the AWS Marketplace is like signing up directly on the Temporal Cloud site, but you're billed through your AWS account.

**2. Accept Account Owner permissions**

{/* Onboarding guide for Temporal Cloud */}

You received email from Temporal that welcomes you to your new Temporal account.
Your email address is now the first [Account Owner](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) for your account.

**3. Set up authentication**

Temporal Cloud supports both TLS and API key authentication.

**TLS authentication**:
You must provide your own CA certificates.
These certificates are needed to create a Namespace, which are in turn used to grant Temporal Clients and Workers access to it.
For certificate requirements, see the following:

- [Requirements for CA certificates](/cloud/certificates#certificate-requirements)
- [Issue root CA and end-entity certificates](/cloud/certificates#issue-certificates)

**API key authentication**: To enable and use API key access, see the following:

- [API key overview](/cloud/api-keys#overview)
- [API key best practices](/cloud/api-keys#best-practices)
- [Troubleshoot your API key use](/cloud/api-keys#troubleshooting)
- [API keys: Frequently Asked Questions](/cloud/api-keys#faqs)

**4. Create a Namespace**

[Create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/namespaces#create-a-namespace) using the Temporal Cloud UI or tcld, if you don't already have a Namespace (or want to create another).

**5. Invite users**

Adding a user to your Temporal Cloud Account includes sending an email invite that the user must then accept.
To add users, see the following:

[How to invite users to your Temporal Cloud account](/cloud/users#invite-users)

**6. Connect to Temporal Cloud**

Update your Temporal Client connections and Workers to use your Temporal Cloud Namespace credentials.

Each SDK has a way to use your CA certificates and private keys to authenticate and authorize access to your Temporal Cloud Namespace.
