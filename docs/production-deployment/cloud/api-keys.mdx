:::

Temporal Cloud supports secure programmatic access through API Key Authentication.

## Overview

Temporal Cloud API Keys facilitate user-level authentication.
Each key is unique to a single user and ties directly to their Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) settings, ensuring secure and appropriate access.

The process is as follows:

```text
API Key (authentication) → User (identity) → RBAC (authorization)
```

These API Keys are integral for authenticating Temporal Cloud operator tools, including [Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld)](/cloud/tcld) and the [Temporal Cloud Operations API](/ops).

Users have the autonomy to create, delete, and update access to their API Keys through the Cloud UI or tcld.

API Keys are an opt-in feature that must be enabled by a Global Administrator for use.
For broader oversight, Global Administrators can manage user's API Keys using the same interfaces.
For instructions on API Key Management for your organization, see [global Administrator API Key Management](#global-administrator-api-key-management).

## Get started {#get-started}

To get started, ensure you're a Temporal Cloud user. If you don't have an account with Temporal, **[sign up here](https://pages.temporal.io/get-started-with-cloud)**.

### Prerequisites

- A Cloud user account
- Access to the [Temporal Cloud UI](https://cloud.temporal.io/) or Temporal Cloud CLI ([tcld](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/))
- [Enable access to API Keys](#manage-api-keys)

## Use API Keys {#use-api-keys}

API Keys can be used in the `tcld` or in the Cloud Ops API.

**How can I use the API Key with tcld?**

To use your API Key with tcld, use one of the following methods:

- `--api-key` flag
- `TEMPORAL_CLOUD_API_KEY` environment variable

**How can I use the API Key with Cloud Ops API?**

To use your API Key with the [Cloud Ops API](/ops), securely pass your API Key in your Cloud Ops API client.

For a complete example, see [Cloud Samples in Go](https://github.com/temporalio/cloud-samples-go/blob/1dd4254b6ed1937e361005c0144410e72b8a5542/client/api/apikey.go).

## Manage API Keys {#manage-api-keys}

Manage your personal API Keys by creating, deleting, or updating access to them using the Cloud UI or tcld.

### Global Administrator API Key Management

:::note

API Keys are not enabled for by default.
You must enable API Key access to allow the creation of API Keys.

:::

Global Administrators can monitor, manage, update access, and delete API Keys for any user within their account.

To manage your accounts API Keys

1. [Login](https://cloud.temporal.io/) to the Cloud UI.
2. [Select **Settings** and choose **API Keys**](https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/api-keys).

From here, you can update access to the API Key for an account using the **Enable** and **Disable** toggle.
You can also disable or delete an individual User API Key using the vertical ellipsis at the right of the API Keys row.

### Generate an API Key

:::note

Once generated, copy and securely save the API Key.
It will be displayed only once for security purposes.

:::

Generate an API Key using one of the following methods.

#### Using the Cloud UI

To generate an API Key using the Cloud UI:

1. [Login](https://cloud.temporal.io/) to the Cloud UI.
2. Navigate to [Profile Page → API Keys](https://cloud.temporal.io/profile/api-keys).
3. Select **Create API Key** and provide the following:
   1. Name
   2. Description
   3. Expiration Date
4. Select **Generate API Key**.

:::note

Temporal supports up to a 90-day duration for API Keys.

:::

#### Using the tcld

To generate an API Key using tcld, use the `tcld apikey create` command.

1. Authenticate your Temporal Cloud account using the [login](/cloud/tcld/login) command.
2. Create an API Key using the [apikey create](/cloud/tcld/apikey#create) command.

For example:

```command
tcld login
tcld apikey create --name Your-Key-Name --description YourDescription --duration 24h
```

:::note

Use tcld to create API Keys with a day level expiration by day.

:::

### Delete an API Key

Delete an API Key using one of the following methods.

#### Using the Cloud UI

To delete an API Key using the Cloud UI

1. [Login](https://cloud.temporal.io/) to the Cloud UI.
2. Navigate to your [Profile Page → API Keys](https://cloud.temporal.io/profile/api-keys).
3. Select the three vertical dots to the right of the API Key's row and choose **Delete**.
4. Choose **Delete**.

#### Using the tcld

To delete an API Key using tcld, pass the API Key ID to the [tcld apikey delete](/cloud/tcld/apikey#delete) command.

1. Authenticate your Temporal Cloud account using the [login](/cloud/tcld/login) command.
2. Delete the API Key using the [apikey delete](/cloud/tcld/apikey#delete) command.

```command
tcld apikey delete --id <your-api-key-id>
```

### Update access to an API Key

You can update access to an API Key by enabling or disabling it.

After disabling an API Key, that API Key will no longer be able to authenticate with Temporal Cloud.
Only enabled keys can authenticate with Temporal Cloud.

#### Using the Cloud UI

To update access to an API Key using the Cloud UI, follow these steps:

1. [Login](https://cloud.temporal.io/) to the Cloud UI.
2. Navigate to [Profile Page → API Keys](https://cloud.temporal.io/profile/api-keys).
3. Select the three vertical dots to the right of the API Key's row and choose **Disable**.

#### Using the tcld

To update access to an API Key using the tcld, follow these steps:

1. Login to tcld using either SSO or an API Key.
2. Use the `apikey disable/enable` commands to disable/enable the key.

```command
tcld apikey disable --id <api-key-id>
tcld apikey enable --id <api-key-id>
```

## Best practices {#best-practices}

- **Keep it secret | Keep it safe**: Treat your API Key as you would a password. Don't expose it in client-side code, public repositories, or other easily accessible places.
- **Rotate regularly**: Change your API Keys periodically to minimize potential harm from any leaks.
- **Monitor usage**: Keep an eye on the usage metrics and logs. If you notice unexpected or unauthorized activity, revoke the key immediately.
- **KMS**: Use a KMS to reduce risks of key leak.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

`Invalid API Key Errors`: Ensure you copied the key correctly and that it hasn't been revoked (deleted) or expired.

## Frequently asked questions {#faqs}

**Q: Can I have multiple API Keys?**

A: Yes, you can generate multiple keys to use in different services or for team members.

**Q: How many API Keys can I have?**

A: 10 per User.

**Q: Is there an expiration for the API Keys?**

A: Yes. During Preview, API Keys have an upper bound of 90 days. In a subsequent release, long-lived API Keys will become available. Temporal recommends rotating API Keys periodically.

**Q: What should I do if I lost my API Key secret?**

A: For security reasons, we only display the full key once upon creation. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.
