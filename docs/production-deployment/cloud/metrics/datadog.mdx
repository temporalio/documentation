Datadog in partnership with Temporal Cloud has created a native integration with Temporal Cloud metrics.
This integration is available to all Datadog customers.

Exporting cloud metrics to Datadog provides enhanced observability, allowing you to monitor, alert, and visualize key performance indicators of your applications and infrastructure.
Temporal's integration with Datadog extends the monitoring capabilities of your Temporal Cloud deployment. Benefits of using this integration include:

- Out-of-the-box Temporal Cloud metrics dashboard in Datadog
- No need to run a service, Datadog connects directly to Temporal Cloud

For detailed instructions on how to use the integration, see [the documentation on Datadog's site](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/temporal_cloud/).
