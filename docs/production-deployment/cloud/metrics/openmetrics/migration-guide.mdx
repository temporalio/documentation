Temporal Cloud is transitioning from our Prometheus query endpoint to an industry-standard OpenMetrics (Prometheus-compatible) endpoint for metrics collection. This migration represents a significant improvement in how you can monitor your Temporal Cloud workloads, bringing enhanced capabilities, better integration with observability tools, and access to high-cardinality metrics that were previously unavailable.

:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

The OpenMetrics endpoint is available in  [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for testing and validation. The existing Prometheus query endpoint remains fully operational and supported.

:::

## Why We're Making This Change

1. **Industry-Standard Format**: Native compatibility with Prometheus and OpenTelemetry and all major observability platforms (Datadog, New Relic etc.) without custom integrations.

2. **High-Cardinality Metrics**: Access to previously unavailable dimensions including:  
   * `temporal_task_queue` labels on multiple metrics  
   * `temporal_workflow_type` labels for workflow-specific monitoring  
   * New task queue backlog metrics for better operational visibility  
3. **Accurate Percentiles**: Our new system provides accurate percentile calculations for latency metrics, even in the presence of substantial outliers, unlike Prometheus-style histograms.

4. **Simplified Integration**: Direct scraping from your observability tools without intermediate translation layers.

5. **Enhanced Performance**: Optimized for high-cardinality data with built-in safeguards for system stability. Data is available to scrape two minutes from the time it was emitted, in line with the freshest metrics [available from any major service provider](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/guide/cloud-metric-delay/).

## What's Changing

| Aspect | Current Query Endpoint | New OpenMetrics Endpoint |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Protocol** | Prometheus Query API (`/api/v1/query`) | OpenMetrics scrape endpoint (`/v1/metrics`) |
| **Authentication** | mTLS certificates with customer-specific endpoints | API keys with global endpoint |
| **Metric Temporality** | Cumulative counters | Delta temporality (pre-computed rates) |
| **Query Requirement** | Direct queries supported | Requires observability platform |
| **Cardinality** | Limited labels | High-cardinality labels available |
| **Metric Naming** | `*_v0_*` metrics | `*_v1_*` metrics |

## Migration Timeline

Here is the current estimated timeline for migrating from the Prometheus query endpoint to the OpenMetrics endpoint. 

:::caution

Timelines can shift so be sure to stay up to date on upcoming releases.

:::

**Public Preview (Current)**
* OpenMetrics endpoint available for onboarding. 
* Both endpoints run in parallel with no changes required.

**General Availability [TBA]**:
* OpenMetrics endpoint becomes production-ready and the standard for metrics collection.

**Query Endpoint Deprecation (6 months after GA)**: 
* Prometheus query endpoint deprecated and eventually removed.

:::important Action Required

Complete migration before the 6 month deprecation window ends.

## Notable Differences

### 1\. No longer use `rate()` in Prometheus queries

Metrics are now pre-computed as per-second rates with delta temporality.

**Before (Prometheus query endpoint)**:

```
rate(temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_request_count[1m])
```

**After (OpenMetrics endpoint)**:

```
temporal_cloud_v1_frontend_service_request_count
```

### 2\. Functions that no longer apply

Metrics from OpenMetrics are already rates, therefore certain Prometheus functions no longer make sense. Below is a non-exhaustive list of some of the functions:

* ❌ `rate()` \- Already computed  
* ❌ `increase()` \- Increase of a rate is meaningless  
* ❌ `irate()` \- Instant rate not applicable  
* ❌ `histogram_quantile()` \- Not applicable (explicit percentiles provided instead)  
* ✅ `sum()`, `avg()`, `max()`, `min()` \- Still work normally

### 3\. Percentile metrics

The new endpoint provides explicit percentile metrics (p50, p95, p99) rather than histogram buckets:

**Before (Prometheus query endpoint)**: Calculate percentiles using `histogram_quantile()`

```shell
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_bucket[5m]))
```

**After (OpenMetrics endpoint)**: Use pre-calculated percentiles directly

```
temporal_cloud_v1_service_latency_p95
```

**Important Tradeoff**: While pre-calculated percentiles are more accurate for individual time series, they *cannot be accurately aggregated*. For example:

* ❌ Cannot sum or average p95 values across Namespaces to get a global p95  
* ❌ Cannot aggregate p95 values across regions or Task Queues  
* ✅ Can still view individual namespace/task queue percentiles accurately  
* ✅ More accurate percentile calculations for individual series, especially with outliers

### 4\. Authentication Setup

**Before**: mTLS certificates with customer-specific endpoint

```shell
curl --cert /path/to/client.pem \
     --key /path/to/client.key \
     --cacert /path/to/ca.pem \

"https://<customer-specific>.tmprl.cloud/api/v1/query?query=rate(temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_request_count[5m])&time=2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
```

**After**: API key with global endpoint

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" https://metrics.temporal.io/v1/metrics
```

## Migration Steps

### Create an API Key

Create a service account within the Temporal Cloud UI settings with the “Metrics Read-Only” Account Level Role.


:::note 

As this is an account-level role, scoping it to specific namespaces has no effect as it will have access to the full account’s metrics.

:::

<CaptionedImage
    src="/img/cloud/metrics/service-account-with-metrics-role.png"
    title="Create Service Account with Metrics Read-Only Role"
/>

Once this is created, you can create an API key within this service account which will inherit the role.  Save this API key in a secure location and use it to access the metrics APIs.

To test that this works, curl the endpoint with your API Key. 

The output should resemble the following example:

```shell
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" https://metrics.temporal.io/v1/metrics

# TYPE temporal_cloud_v1_frontend_service_error_count gauge
# HELP temporal_cloud_v1_frontend_service_error_count The number of gRPC errors returned by frontend service
# TYPE temporal_cloud_v1_frontend_service_pending_requests gauge
# HELP temporal_cloud_v1_frontend_service_pending_requests The number of pollers that are waiting for a task
# TYPE temporal_cloud_v1_frontend_service_request_count gauge
# HELP temporal_cloud_v1_frontend_service_request_count The number of RPC requests received by the service..
```

Now you are ready to scrape your metrics\!

### Configuring Grafana \+ Prometheus

#### Update Prometheus Configuration

Add a new scrape job for the OpenMetrics endpoint with your API key.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: temporal-cloud
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - 'metrics.temporal.io'
    scheme: https
    metrics_path: '/v1/metrics'
    honor_timestamps: true
    scrape_interval: 60s
    scrape_timeout: 30s
    authorization:
      type: Bearer
      credentials: 'API_KEY'
```

:::note

This replaces the direct Grafana datasource configuration you used with the query endpoint.

:::

#### Install New Dashboards

* Download the new Grafana dashboard: [temporal\_cloud\_openmetrics.json](https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards/blob/master/cloud/temporal_cloud_openmetrics.json)  
* Import alongside existing dashboards during transition  
* Update any custom alerts and queries to use new metrics and remove `rate()` functions

### Configuring Datadog

:::tip

Automated integration update coming soon.

:::

The Datadog team is working on updating the official Temporal Cloud integration to use the new endpoint. This transition should be largely transparent for most users.

For users that want to get started immediately, Temporal Cloud metrics can be directly integrated into Datadog by configuring the Datadog agent to scrape the OpenMetrics endpoint.  An example for that lives [here](https://github.com/temporal-community/cloud-metrics-scrape-examples/tree/main/datadog/openmetrics).

#### Other Observability Providers

Consult the documentation for your observability system for how to configure it to scrape this endpoint and retrieve your metrics:

* [NewRelic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/configure-prometheus-openmetrics-integrations/)  
* [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#receivers)

Examples for all these integrations live [here](https://github.com/temporal-community/cloud-metrics-scrape-examples).

### Metric Mapping Reference

Below is a template for mapping metrics from the old query endpoint to the new OpenMetrics endpoint. Note that all metrics follow the pattern of `v0` → `v1` version change, and the fundamental difference is the shift from cumulative counters to pre-computed rates for the majority of the metrics. Note that the labels below are only new labels added to the metrics. For the complete list of labels, see the /production-deployment/cloud/metrics/openmetrics/metrics-reference.

In addition to these metrics, there are a number of new metrics provided by our OpenMetrics endpoint. 


:::info

See the [metrics reference](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/openmetrics/metrics-reference) for an up-to-date list of all available metrics and their full descriptions.

:::

### Managing High-Cardinality

The new endpoint provides access to high-cardinality labels that can significantly increase your metric volume:

#### High-Cardinality Labels

* `temporal_task_queue`  
* `temporal_workflow_type`

#### Best Practices

##### Namespace/Metric filtering

Namespace filtering can be used to ensure that metrics are scraped for relevant Namespaces, which reduces cardinality.

```
https://metrics.temporal.io/v1/metrics?namespaces=production-*
```

This can be taken further by only scraping relevant metrics for a given namespace which ensures that any new high cardinality metrics won’t be an issue for your observability system.

```
https://metrics.temporal.io/v1/metrics?metrics=temporal_cloud_v1_workflow_success_count?namespaces=production-*
```

##### Relabeling

If the above doesn’t work, consider dropping problematic labels post-scrape but pre-ingestion into your observability system.  

For example, in Prometheus this can be done via [relabeling rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config).

```yaml
metric_relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [__name__]
  regex: 'temporal_cloud_v1_poll_success_count'
  action: labeldrop
  regex: 'temporal_task_queue'
```

Or you can even relabel certain label values in order to keep significant ones. For example, it’s possible to rename less important task queues to “unknown” while retaining important ones.

```yaml
metric_relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [temporal_task_queue]
  regex: '(critical-queue|payment-queue)'
  target_label: __tmp_keep_original
  replacement: 'true'
# For anything without the keep flag, replace with "unknown"  
- source_labels: [__tmp_keep_original]
  regex: ''  # empty/missing value
  target_label: temporal_task_queue
  replacement: 'unknown'
# Clean up the temporary label
- regex: '__tmp_keep_original'
  action: labeldrop
```

## Limits

See [API limits](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/openmetrics/api-reference#api-limits) for details.

## FAQ

### Q: Can I still query metrics directly (e.g. with a Grafana dashboard)?

Currently, the OpenMetrics endpoint requires an observability platform to collect and query metrics. Direct querying via API to return a time series of data is not supported. Supporting this type of query pattern is a future roadmap item.

### Q: What happens to my existing dashboards and alerts?

During the transition period, both endpoints remain active.

### Q: Will historical data be preserved?

Historical data from the query endpoint will remain in your observability platform. To maintain continuity:

* Combine old (`v0`) and new (`v1`) metrics in your queries during transition  
* Consider using the PromQL `or` operator: `metric_v1 or metric_v0`

### Q: Are there limits to how frequently I can scrape or how much data will be returned?

The limits are documented [here](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/openmetrics/api-reference#api-limits).

### Q: Why are some metrics missing from my scrapes? I don’t see all the metrics documented.

The OpenMetrics endpoint only returns metrics that were generated during the one-minute aggregation window. This is different from the query endpoint which might return zeros.

**What this means:**

* If no workflows failed in the last minute, `temporal_cloud_v1_workflow_failed_count` won't appear in that scrape.
* If a specific task queue had no activity, its metrics will be absent.
* The set of metrics returned varies between scrapes based on system activity.

**This is normal behavior.** Unlike some metrics systems that populate zeros, the OpenMetrics endpoint follows a sparse reporting pattern \- metrics only appear when there's actual data to report.

**How to handle this in queries:**

```
(temporal_cloud_v1_workflow_failed_count{namespace="production"} or vector(0))
```

This ensures your dashboards and alerts work correctly even when metrics are temporarily absent due to no activity.
