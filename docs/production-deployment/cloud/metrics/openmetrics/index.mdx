## Overview
Temporal Cloud OpenMetrics exposes 30+ metrics covering workflow lifecycles, task queue operations, service performance, and system limits. All metrics are aggregated over one-minute windows and available for scraping within two minutes.

* [Set up authentication and scraping](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/openmetrics/api-reference#authentication) with the API documentation. 
* Browse the [complete metrics catalog](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/openmetrics/metrics-reference) for descriptions and labels. 
* Teams using the query endpoint should review the [migration guide](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/openmetrics/migration-guide).

## API key authentication
Create a [service account](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/openmetrics/migration-guide#create-an-api-key) with the "Metrics Read-Only" role, generate an API key, and start scraping immediately - no certificate rotation or distribution required.

## Global endpoint
This is a single endpoint at `metrics.temporal.io` which serves all metrics across your entire account with API key authentication and standard HTTPS.

## Namespace and metric filtering
You can use query parameters to enable selective scraping to manage data volume and costs, which support wildcards for flexible namespace selection and specific metric filtering.

## Dashboard templates
Production-ready [Grafana dashboards](https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards/blob/master/cloud/temporal_cloud_openmetrics.json) provide immediate visibility with pre-built queries and visualizations.
