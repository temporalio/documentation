A metric is a measurement or data point that provides insights into the performance and health of a system.
This document describes the metrics available on the Temporal Cloud platform.
Temporal Cloud metrics help you monitor performance and troubleshoot errors.
They provide insights into different aspects of the Service.

This guide covers these topics:

- **[Gather metrics](#gather)**:
  Capture Temporal Cloud metrics using a Prometheus-style endpoint so they can be visualized using Prometheus and Grafana or exported to observability platforms like Datadog.
- **[Available Temporal Cloud metrics](#available-metrics)**:
  The metrics emitted by Temporal Cloud include counts of gRPC errors, requests, successful task matches to a poller, and more.
- **[Metrics labels](#metrics-labels)**:
  Temporal Cloud metrics labels can filter metrics and help categorize and differentiate results.
- **[Operations](#metrics-operations)**:
  An operation is a special type of label that categorizes the type of operation being performed when the metric was collected.

:::info SDK METRICS

This document discusses metrics emitted by [Temporal Cloud](/cloud).
Temporal SDKs also emit metrics, sourced from Temporal Clients and Worker processes.
You can find information about Temporal SDK metrics on its [dedicated page](/references/sdk-metrics).

Please note:

- SDK metrics start with the phrase `temporal_`.
- Temporal Cloud metrics start with `temporal_cloud_`.

## Gather metrics {#gather}

**How do you capture and use Temporal Cloud metrics?**

Temporal Cloud emits metrics in a Prometheus-supported format.
Prometheus is an open-source toolkit for alerting and monitoring.
The Temporal Service exposes Cloud metrics with a [Prometheus HTTP API endpoint](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/).
Temporal Cloud metrics provide a compatible data source for visualizing, monitoring, and observability platforms like Grafana and Data Dog.

You can use functions like `rate` or `increase` to calculate the rate of increase for a Temporal Cloud metric:

```
rate(temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_request_count[$__rate_interval])
```

Or you might use Prometheus to calculate average latencies or histogram quartiles:

```
# Average latency
rate(temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_sum[$__rate_interval])
/ rate(temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_count[$__rate_interval])

# Approximate 99th percentile latency broken down by operation
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_bucket[$__rate_interval])) by (le, operation))
```

Set up Grafana with Temporal Cloud observability to view metrics by creating or getting your Prometheus endpoint for Temporal Cloud metrics and enabling SDK metrics.

## Metrics labels {#metrics-labels}

**What labels can you use to filter metrics?**

Temporal Cloud metrics include key-value pairs called labels in their associated metadata.
Labels help you categorize and differentiate metrics for precise filtering, querying, and aggregation.
Use labels to specific attributes or compare values, such as numeric buckets in histograms.
This added context enhances the monitoring and analysis capabilities, providing deeper insights into your data.

Metrics for all Namespaces in your account are available from the [metrics endpoint](#gather).
Use the following labels to filter metrics:

| Label                      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `le`                       | Less than or equal to (`le`) is used in histograms to categorize observations into buckets based on their value being less than or equal to a predefined upper limit.                                                                                                                      |
| `operation`                | This includes operations such as:<ul><li>SignalWorkflowExecution</li><li>StartBatchOperation</li><li>StartWorkflowExecution</li><li>TaskQueueMgr</li><li>TerminateWorkflowExecution</li><li>UpdateNamespace</li><li>UpdateSchedule</li></ul> See: [Metric Operations](#metrics-operations) |
| `resource_exhausted_cause` | Cause for resource exhaustion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `task_type`                | Activity, Workflow, or Nexus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `temporal_account`         | Temporal Account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `temporal_namespace`       | Temporal Namespace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `is_background`            | This label on `temporal_cloud_v0_total_action_count` indicates when actions are produced by a Temporal background job, for example: hourly Workflow Export.                                                                                                                                |
| `namespace_mode`           | This label on `temporal_cloud_v0_total_action_count` indicates if actions are produced by an active vs a standby Namespace. For a regular Namespace, `namespace_mode` will always be “active”.                                                                                             |

The following is an example of how you can filter metrics using labels:

```text
temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count{__rollup__="true", operation="TaskQueueMgr", task_type="Activity", temporal_account="12345", temporal_namespace="your_namespace.12345", temporal_service_type="matching"}
```
