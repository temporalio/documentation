Most Temporal Cloud metrics are suffixed with `_count`.
This indicates that they behave largely like a [Prometheus counter](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter).
You'll want to use a function like `rate` or `increase` to calculate a per-second rate of increase, or an extrapolated total increase over a time period.

```
rate(temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_request_count[5m])
```

`temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency` has `_bucket`, `_count`, and `_sum` metrics. This is because it's a [Prometheus Histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram).
You can use the `_count` and `_sum` metrics to calculate an average latency over a time period, or use the `_bucket` metric to calculate an approximate histogram quartile.

```
# the average latency observation over the last 5 minutes
rate(temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_sum[5m]) / rate(temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_count[5m])

# the approximate 99th percentile latency over the last 5 minutes, broken down by operation
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_bucket[5m])) by (le, operation))
```

## Metric labels {#metric-labels}

Metrics for all Namespaces in your account are available from the metrics endpoint.
Use the following labels to filter metrics:

| Label                      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `le`                       | Less than or equal to (`le`) is used in histograms to categorize observations into buckets based on their value being less than or equal to a predefined upper limit.                                                                                                     |
| `operation`                | This includes operations such as:<ul><li>SignalWorkflowExecution</li><li>StartBatchOperation</li><li>StartWorkflowExecution</li><li>TaskQueueMgr</li><li>TerminateWorkflowExecution</li><li>UpdateNamespace</li><li>UpdateSchedule</li></ul> This list is non-exhaustive. |

| `temporal_service_type`    | Frontend or Matching or History or Worker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `is_background`            | This label on `temporal_cloud_v0_total_action_count` indicates when actions are produced by a Temporal background job, for example: hourly Workflow Export.                                                                                                               |
| `namespace_mode`           | This label on `temporal_cloud_v0_total_action_count` indicates if actions are produced by an active vs a passive Namespace. For a regular Namespace, `namespace_mode` will always be “active”.                                                                            |

The following is an example of how you can filter metrics using labels:

```text
temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count{__rollup__="true", operation="TaskQueueMgr", task_type="Activity", temporal_account="12345", temporal_namespace="your_namespace.12345", temporal_service_type="matching"}
```
