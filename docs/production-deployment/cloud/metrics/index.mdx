Temporal offers two distinct sources of metrics: [Cloud/Server Metrics](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference) and [SDK Metrics](/references/sdk-metrics).
Each source provides options for levels of granularity and filtering, monitoring-tool integrations, and configuration.
Before implementing Temporal Cloud observability, decide what you need to measure for your use case. There are two primary use cases for metrics:

- To measure the health and performance of Temporal-backed applications and key business processes.
- To measure the health and performance of Temporal infrastructure and user provided infrastructure in the form of Temporal Workers and Temporal Clients.

When measuring the performance of Temporal-backed applications and key business processes, you should rely on Temporal SDK metrics as a source of truth.
This is because Temporal SDKs provide visibility from the perspective of your application, not from the perspective of the Temporal Service.

SDK metrics monitor individual workers and your code's behavior.
Cloud metrics monitor Temporal behavior.
When used together, Temporal Cloud and SDK metrics measure the health and performance of your full Temporal infrastructure, including the Temporal Cloud Service and user-supplied Temporal Workers.

Metrics for all Namespaces in your account are available from your metrics endpoint.

Metrics lag real-time performance by about one minute.

Temporal Cloud retains raw metrics for seven days.

To ensure security of your metrics, a CA certificate dedicated to observability is required.
Only clients that use certificates signed by that CA, or that chain up to the CA, can query the metrics endpoint.
For more information about CA certificates in Temporal Cloud, see [Certificate requirements](/cloud/certificates#certificate-requirements).
