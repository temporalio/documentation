Beyond the [metrics](/references/sdk-metrics) provided by the Temporal SDKs, some key metrics exist only in Temporal Cloud.
You can use your own observability tool to query an endpoint and review Namespace metrics.

To ensure security of your metrics, a CA certificate dedicated to observability is required.
Only clients that use certificates signed by that CA, or that chain up to the CA, can query the metrics endpoint.
For more information about CA certificates in Temporal Cloud, see [Certificate requirements](/cloud/certificates#certificate-requirements).

## How to configure a metrics endpoint using Temporal Cloud UI {#configure-via-ui}

:::note

To view and manage third-party integration settings, your user account must have the Global Admin [Role](/cloud/users#account-level-roles).

:::

To assign a certificate and generate your metrics endpoint, follow these steps:

1. In Temporal Cloud UI, click **Settings**.
2. On the **Settings** page, click **Integrations**.
3. In the **Connection** section, paste the URL that was generated in the Observability section on the Temporal Cloud UI.
4. The **Authentication** section may be left as **No Authentication**.
5. In the **TLS Settings** section, select **TLS Client Authentication**:

- Leave **ServerName** blank (this is not required).
- Paste in your end-entity certificate and key.
  Note that the end-entity certificate used here must be part of the certificate chain with the root CA certificates used in your Temporal Cloud observability setup.

6. Select **Save and test** to verify that the data source is working.

After the page refreshes, the new metrics endpoint appears below **Endpoint**, in the form `https://<account-id>.tmprl.cloud/prometheus`.
Use the endpoint to configure your observability tool—for example, [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) with [this dashboard](https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards/blob/master/cloud/temporal_cloud.json).
For more information, see [Set up Grafana with Temporal Cloud](/cloud/metrics/prometheus-grafana#prometheus-and-grafana-setup).

You can also query via the [Prometheus HTTP API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/) at URLs like:

```
https://<account-id>.tmprl.cloud/prometheus/api/v1/query?query=temporal_cloud_v0_state_transition_count
```

For example:

```
$ curl --cert client.pem --key client-key.pem "https://<account-id>.tmprl.cloud/prometheus/api/v1/query?query=temporal_cloud_v0_state_transition_count" | jq .
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "resultType": "vector",
    "result": [
      {
        "metric": {
          "__name__": "temporal_cloud_v0_state_transition_count",
          "__rollup__": "true",
          "operation": "WorkflowContext",
          "temporal_account": "your-account",
          "temporal_namespace": "your-namespace.your-account-is",
          "temporal_service_type": "history"
        },
        "value": [
          1672347471.2,
          "0"
        ]
      },
      ...
}
```

## How to configure a metrics endpoint using the tcld CLI {#configure-via-cli-(tcld)}

To add a certificate to a metrics endpoint, use [`tcld account metrics accepted-client-ca add`](/cloud/tcld/account#add).

To enable a metrics endpoint, use [`tcld account metrics enable`](/cloud/tcld/account#enable).

To disable a metrics endpoint, use [`tcld account metrics disable`](/cloud/tcld/account#disable).

For more information, see [tcld account metrics command](/cloud/tcld/account#metrics).

## What metrics are emitted from Temporal Cloud? {#available-metrics}

Metrics for all Namespaces in your account are available from the metrics endpoint.

Metrics lag real-time performance by about one minute.

Temporal Cloud retains raw metrics for seven days.

The following metrics are emitted for your various Namespaces.

### temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_error_count

This is a count of gRPC errors returned aggregated by operation.

### temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_request_count

This is a count of gRPC requests received aggregated by operation.

### temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count

Tasks that are successfully matched to a poller.

### temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_sync_count

Tasks that are successfully sync matched to a poller.

### temporal_cloud_v0_poll_timeout_count

When no tasks are available for a poller before timing out.

### temporal_cloud_v0_resource_exhausted_error_count

gRPC requests received that were rate-limited by Temporal Cloud, aggregated by cause.

### temporal_cloud_v0_schedule_action_success_count

## Metric labels

Metrics for all Namespaces in your account are available from the metrics endpoint.
Use the following labels to filter metrics:

| Label                      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `le`                       | Less than or equal to (`le`) is used in histograms to categorize observations into buckets based on their value being less than or equal to a predefined upper limit.                                                                                                     |
| `operation`                | This includes operations such as:<ul><li>SignalWorkflowExecution</li><li>StartBatchOperation</li><li>StartWorkflowExecution</li><li>TaskQueueMgr</li><li>TerminateWorkflowExecution</li><li>UpdateNamespace</li><li>UpdateSchedule</li></ul> This list is non-exhaustive. |

| `task_type`                | Activity or Workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `is_background`            | This label on `temporal_cloud_v0_total_action_count` indicates when actions are produced by a Temporal background job, for example: hourly Workflow Export.                                                                                                               |
| `namespace_mode`           | This label on `temporal_cloud_v0_total_action_count` indicates if actions are produced by an active vs a passive Namespace. For a regular Namespace, `namespace_mode` will always be “active”.                                                                            |

The following is an example of how you can filter metrics using labels:

```text
temporal_cloud_v0_poll_success_count{__rollup__="true", operation="TaskQueueMgr", task_type="Activity", temporal_account="12345", temporal_namespace="your_namespace.12345", temporal_service_type="matching"}
```

## How to use Temporal Cloud performance metrics {#how-to-use}

Most Temporal Cloud metrics are suffixed with `_count`. This indicates that they behave largely like a [Prometheus counter](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter). You'll want to use a function like `rate` or `increase` to calculate a per-second rate of increase, or an extrapolated total increase over a time period.

```
rate(temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_request_count[5m])
```

`temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency` has `_bucket`, `_count`, and `_sum` metrics. This is because it's a [Prometheus Histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram). You can use the `_count` and `_sum` metrics to calculate an average latency over a time period, or use the `_bucket` metric to calculate an approximate histogram quartile.

```
# the average latency observation over the last 5 minutes
rate(temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_sum[5m]) / rate(temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_count[5m])

# the approximate 99th percentile latency over the last 5 minutes, broken down by operation
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_bucket[5m])) by (le, operation))
```
