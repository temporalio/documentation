## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before configuring the Export Sink, ensure you have the following:

1. An AWS Account with write permission to an S3 bucket.
2. An AWS S3 bucket.
   - The S3 bucket must reside in the same region as your Namespace.
3. (optional) A KMS ARN associated with the S3 bucket.

## Configure Workflow History Export

How to Configure Workflow History Export Using Temporal Cloud UI or `tcld`

You can use either the [Temporal Cloud UI](#using-temporal-cloud-ui) or [`tcld`](#using-tcld) to configure the Workflow History Export.

The Temporal Cloud UI provides two ways for configuring Workflow History Export:

- [Automated setup](#automated-setup) (recommended): The Cloud UI launches the AWS CloudFormation Console to create a stack, with write permission to the S3 bucket.
- [Manual setup](#manual-setup): The Cloud UI provides a CloudFormation template for users to manually configure a CloudFormation stack.

:::note Why does Temporal Cloud provision multiple service accounts for Export?

Temporal Cloud creates multiple intermediary service accounts for export operations primarily for security purposes. The system randomly selects from these accounts when writing to your storage sink, which provides several benefits:

- **Security isolation**: If one service account is compromised or needs to be decommissioned, other accounts remain available
- **Load distribution**: Prevents exclusively using a single account, reducing security risk
- **Warm standby**: Keeps multiple accounts active to avoid potential throttling when switching between accounts
- **Reliability**: Provides resilience against cloud provider account-level issues that could affect a single service account

This approach prioritizes security and availability, ensuring robust export operations even if individual service accounts encounter issues.

### Using Temporal Cloud UI

The following steps guide you through setting up Workflow History Export using the Temporal Cloud UI.

:::tip

Don't forget to click **Create** at the end of your setup to confirm your export.

#### Automated setup

You can use the automated setup to create a CloudFormation stack with write permission to your S3 bucket.
Make sure to verify the export setup before you save the configuration.

1. Open the Temporal Cloud UI and navigate to the Namespace you want to configure.
2. Select **Configure** from the **Export** card.
3. Provide the following information to configure the export sink and then select **Create and launch stack**:
   - Name: A name for the export sink.
   - AWS S3 Bucket Name: The name of the configured AWS S3 bucket to send Closed Workflow Histories to.
   - AWS Account ID: The AWS account ID.
   - Role Name: The name of the AWS IAM role to use for the CloudFormation stack that has write permission to the S3 bucket.
   - KMS ARN: (optional) The ARN of the AWS KMS key to use for encryption of the exported Workflow History.
4. You will be taken to the CloudFormation Console to create the stack with pre-populated information.
   - Review the information and then select **Create stack**.

#### Manual setup

You can manually configure a CloudFormation stack using the provided template.

1. Open the Temporal Cloud UI and navigate to the Namespace you want to configure.
2. Select **Configure** from the **Export** card.
3. Select **Manual** from **Access method**.
   - Enter the Template URL into your web browser to download your copy of the CloudFormation template.
   - Configure the CloudFormation template for your export sink.
   - Follow the steps in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-using-console-create-stack-template.html) by uploading the template to the CloudFormation console.

### Using `tcld`

Run the `tcld namespace export s3 create` command and provide the following information.

- `--namespace` : The Namespace to configure export for.
- `--sink-name`: The name of the export sink.
- `--role-arn`: The ARN of the AWS IAM role to use for the CloudFormation stack that has write permission to the S3 bucket.
- `--s3-bucket-name`: The name of the AWS S3 bucket.

For example:

```command
tcld namespace export s3 create --namespace "your-namespace.your-account" --sink-name "your-sink-name" --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/test-sink" --s3-bucket-name "your-aws-s3-bucket-name”
```

Retrieve the status of this command by running the `tcld namespace export s3 get` command.

For example:

```command
tcld namespace export s3 get --namespace "your-namespace.your-account" --sink-name "your-sink-name"
```

The following is an example of the output:

```json
{
  "name": "your-sink-name",
  "resourceVersion": "a6442895-1c07-4da4-aaca-58d57d338345",
  "state": "Active",
  "spec": {
    "name": "your-sink-name",
    "enabled": true,
    "destinationType": "S3",
    "s3Sink": {
      "roleName": "your-export-test",
      "bucketName": "your-export-test",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "kmsArn": "",
      "awsAccountId": "123456789012"
    }
  },
  "health": "Ok",
  "errorMessage": "",
  "latestDataExportTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "lastHealthCheckTime": "2023-08-14T21:30:02Z"
}
```
