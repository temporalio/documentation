## Service Accounts

### Overview

Temporal Cloud helps Global Administrators create machine identities named Service Accounts.

Service Accounts are a new type of identity in Temporal Cloud. Today, Temporal Cloud supports User identities as a representation of a human user who uses Temporal Cloud.
Service Accounts afford Temporal Cloud Global Administrators the ability to create an identity for machine authentication, an identity not associated with a human user.

With the addition of Service Accounts, Temporal Cloud now supports 2 identity types:

- Users (Tied to a human, identified by email address or id)
- Service Accounts (Not tied to a human, email address optional, identified by name or id)

Service Accounts use API Keys as the authentication mechanism to connect to Temporal Cloud.
Use Service Accounts to automate Temporal Cloud operations with a non-human identity and, when API Key authentication is supported in the SDKs and the Temporal CLI, to productionalize Workflow execution and management.

## Get started

To get started with Service Accounts, ensure youʼre a Temporal Cloud user. If you donʼt have an account with Temporal, [sign up here](https://pages.temporal.io/get-started-with-cloud).

**Prerequisites:**

- A Cloud user account with Global Admin permissions
- Access to the Temporal Cloud UI or Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld)
- Enable access to API Keys for your Account
- Request Temporal enable the Service Account feature-flag for your Account
- To manage Service Accounts using the Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld), upgrade to the latest version of tcld (0.18.0 or higher) using `brew upgrade tcld`, and enable the Service Account commands with `tcld feature toggle-service-account`.

## Managing Service Accounts

Global Administrators can manage Service Accounts by creating, viewing, updating, deleting Service Accounts using the following tools:

- Temporal Cloud UI
- Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld)
  - Use `tcld service-account --help` for a list of all service-account commands

Global Administrators also have the ability to manage API Keys for Service Accounts.

### Create a Service Account

Create a Service Account using the Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.
While User identities are invited to Temporal Cloud, Service Accounts are created in Temporal Cloud.

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Click the Create Service Account button located near the top right of the Identities & API Keys page
3. Provide the following information:

- Name (required)
- Description (optional)
- Account Level Role (required)
- Namespace Permissions (optional)
  - Use this section of the Create Service Account page to grant the Service Account access to individual Namespaces

4. Click Create Service Account at the bottom of the page

- A status message is displayed at the bottom right corner of the screen and on the next screen
- You will be prompted to create an API Key for the Service Account (optional)

5. (Optional) Create API Key

- It is recommended to create an API Key for the Service Account right after you create the Service Account, though you can create/manage API Keys for Service Accounts at any time.

#### Using tcld

To create a Service Account using tcld, use the `tcld service-account create` command:

```
tcld service-account create -d "this is a test SA" -n "sa_test"
```

This example creates a Service Account with a name (`-n`) of "sa_test", a description (`-d`) "this is a test SA" and an Account Role of Read.

Creating a Service Account requires the following attributes: name, account-role.
You can also provide Account Roles and Namespace Permissions for the Service Account using the —ar and —np command flags.
Creating a Service Account returns the ServiceAccountId which is used to update or delete a Service Account.

### View Service Accounts

View a single or all Service Account(s) using the Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.

#### Using the Cloud UI

Service Accounts are listed in line with User Identities.
To locate a Service Account, look for identities that include the Service Account icon.

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Look for the Service Account icon next to an identity

#### Using tcld

To view all Service Accounts in your account using tcld, use the `tcld service-account list` command:

```
tcld service-account list
```

### Delete a Service Account

Delete a Service Account using the Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Find the Service Account you would like to delete
3. Click the three vertical dots in the Service Account row
4. Select Delete from the menu displayed
5. Confirm the Delete action when prompted

#### Using tcld

To delete a Service Account using tcld, use the `tcld service-account delete` command:

```
tcld service-account delete --service-account-id "e9d87418221548"
```

Use the tcld Service Account list command to validate the Service Account has been removed from the account.
The Service Account is deleted when it is no longer visible in the output of .

### Update a Service Account

Update a Service Accountʼs description using the Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Find the Service Account you would like to update
3. Click the three vertical dots in the Service Account row
4. Select Edit from the menu displayed
5. Make changes to the Service Account.
   You can change the Service Account's name, description, Account Level Role, and Namespace Permissions.
6. Click the Save button located in the bottom left of the screen.
   A status message is displayed at the bottom right corner of the screen.

#### Using tcld

Three different commands exist to help users update a Service Account using tcld:

- `tcld service-account update`: To update a Service Account's name or description field
- `tcld service-account set-account-role`: To update a Service Account's Account Role
- `tcld service-account set-namespace-permissions`: To update a Service Account's Namespace Permissions

Example:

```
tcld update --id "2f68507677904e09b9bcdbf93380bb95" -d "new description"
```

## Managing API Keys for Service Accounts

Global Administrators have ability to manage API Keys for any Service Account in their Temporal Cloud Account.
The process to manage API Keys for Service Accounts is very similar to the process of managing API Keys for Users with one difference: Unlike User API Keys, Global Admins are able to generate API Keys for Service Accounts.
Disabling/enabling, deleting, and viewing API Keys for Service Accounts follows the same process as API Keys for Users.

### Create an API Key for a Service Account

Create an API Key for a Service Account using the Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Click the Create API Key button
3. Click Service Account at the top of the page under "Create an API Key for*"
4. Select the Service Account you would like to create an API Key in the “Mapped to identityˮ input box.
   Existing Service Accounts are provided in the “Mapped to Identityˮ box.
5. Add values for the API Key. This includes:

- name (required)
- description (optional)
- Expiration date (required - defaulted to 30 days)
- The current max expiration duration for API Keys is 90 days.

6. Click the Generate API Key button
7. You will see the new API keyʼs secret, if the API Key was created successfully.
   Copy and store the secret somewhere safe.

#### Using tcld

To create an API Key for a Service Account, use `tcld apikey create` with the `--service-account-id` flag:

```
tcld apikey create -n saAK1 --desc "Service Account API Key" --duration 30d --service-account-id "2f68507677904e09b9bcdbf93380bb95"
```

API Keys for Service Accounts appear in the list of API Keys in the UI and tcld.

### Update an API Key for a Service Account

Global Administrators have ability to disable/enable individual API Keys for any user in their account using the Cloud UI or tcld.

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Find the identity that owns the API Key to disable/enable
3. Click the Disable/Enable button to perform the desired action.
   There may be a delay after changing the status of an API Key.
4. Once successful, the API Keys status will be reflected in the row.

#### Using tcld

Use the `tcld apikey disable` or `tcld apikey enable` command, to disable or enable an API Key.

The process for enabling/disabling an API Key is the same for a User or a Service Account.

### Delete an API Key for a Service Account

Global Administrators have ability to delete individual API Keys for any user in their account using the Cloud UI or tcld.

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Find the identity that owns the API Key to disable/enable and click on the row to see the API Keys associated with the identity.
3. Click the Delete button. There may be a delay after changing the status of an API Key.
4. Once successful, the API Keys status will be reflected in the row.

#### Using tcld

Use the `tcld apikey delete` command, to delete an API Key.
The process for deleting an API Key is the same for a User or a Service Account.
