## Service Accounts 

### Overview

Temporal Cloud helps Global Administrators create machine identities named Service Accounts.

Service Accounts are a new type of identity in Temporal Cloud. Today, Temporal Cloud supports User identities as a representation of a human user who uses Temporal Cloud. 
Service Accounts afford Temporal Cloud Global Administrators the ability to create an identity for machine authentication, an identity not associated with a human user.

With the addition of Service Accounts, Temporal Cloud now supports 2 identity types:
- Users (Tied to a human, identified by email address or id)
- Service Accounts (Not tied to a human, email address optional, identified by name or id)

Service Accounts use API Keys as the authentication mechanism to connect to Temporal Cloud.
Use Service Accounts to automate Temporal Cloud operations with a non-human identity and, when API Key authentication is supported in the SDKs and the Temporal CLI, to productionalize Workflow execution and management.


## Managing Service Accounts

Global Administrators can manage Service Accounts by creating, viewing, updating, deleting Service Accounts using the following tools:
- Temporal Cloud UI
- Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld)
  - Use `tcld service-account --help` for a list of all service-account commands
- (Soon) The Cloud Operations API

Global Administrators also have the ability to manage API Keys for Service Accounts.

### Create a Service Account

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Click the Create Service Account button located near the top right of the Identities & API Keys page
3. Provide the following information:
   a. Name (required)
   b. Description (optional)
   c. Account Level Role (required)
   d. Namespace Permissions (optional)
      - Use this section of the Create Service Account page to grant the Service Account access to individual Namespaces
4. Click Create Service Account at the bottom of the page
5. (Optional) Create API Key

#### Using tcld

To create a Service Account using tcld, use the `tcld service-account create` command:

```
tcld service-account create -d "this is a test SA" -n "sa_test"
```

This example creates a Service Account with a name (`-n`) of "sa_test", a description (`-d`) "this is a test SA" and an Account Role of Read.

### View Service Accounts

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Look for the Service Account icon next to an identity

#### Using tcld

To view all Service Accounts in your account using tcld, use the `tcld service-account list` command:

```
tcld service-account list
```

### Delete a Service Account

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Find the Service Account you would like to delete
3. Click the three vertical dots in the Service Account row
4. Select Delete from the menu displayed
5. Confirm the Delete action when prompted

#### Using tcld

To delete a Service Account using tcld, use the `tcld service-account delete` command:

```
tcld service-account delete --service-account-id "e9d87418221548"
```

### Update a Service Account

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Find the Service Account you would like to update
3. Click the three vertical dots in the Service Account row
4. Select Edit from the menu displayed
5. Make changes to the Service Account
6. Click the Save button located in the bottom left of the screen

#### Using tcld

Three different commands exist to help users update a Service Account using tcld:
- `tcld service-account update`: To update a Service Account's name or description field
- `tcld service-account set-account-role`: To update a Service Account's Account Role
- `tcld service-account set-namespace-permissions`: To update a Service Account's Namespace Permissions

Example:

```
tcld update --id "2f68507677904e09b9bcdbf93380bb95" -d "new description"
```

## Managing API Keys for Service Accounts

#### Using tcld

To create an API Key for a Service Account, use `tcld apikey create` with the `--service-account-id` flag:
