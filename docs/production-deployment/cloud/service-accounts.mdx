Temporal Cloud provides Account Owner and Global Admin [roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) with the option to create machine identities named Service Accounts.

Service Accounts are a type of identity in Temporal Cloud. Temporal Cloud supports User identities as a representation of a human user who uses Temporal Cloud.
Service Accounts afford Temporal Cloud Account Owner and Global Admin [roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) the ability to create an identity for machine authentication, an identity not associated with a human user.

With the addition of Service Accounts, Temporal Cloud now supports 2 identity types:

- Users (Tied to a human, identified by email address or id)
- Service Accounts (Not tied to a human, email address optional, identified by name or id)

Service Accounts use API Keys as the authentication mechanism to connect to Temporal Cloud.
Use Service Accounts represent a non-human identity when authenticating to Temporal Cloud for operations automation or the Temporal SDKs and the Temporal CLI for Workflow execution and management.

## Get started

To get started with Service Accounts, ensure youʼre a Temporal Cloud user.

**Prerequisites:**

- A Cloud user account with Account Owner or Global Admin [role](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) permissions
- Access to the Temporal Cloud UI or Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld)
- Enable access to API Keys for your Account
- To manage Service Accounts using the Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld), upgrade to the latest version of tcld (0.18.0 or higher) using `brew upgrade tcld`, and enable the Service Account commands with `tcld feature toggle-service-account`.

## Managing Service Accounts

Account Owner and Global Admin [roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) can manage Service Accounts by creating, viewing, updating, deleting Service Accounts using the following tools:

- Temporal Cloud UI
- Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld)
  - Use `tcld service-account --help` for a list of all service-account commands

Account Owner and Global Admin [roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) also have the ability to manage API Keys for Service Accounts.

### Create a Service Account

Create a Service Account using the Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.
While User identities are invited to Temporal Cloud, Service Accounts are created in Temporal Cloud.

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Click the Create Service Account button located near the top right of the Identities & API Keys page
3. Provide the following information:

4. Click Create Service Account at the bottom of the page

- A status message is displayed at the bottom right corner of the screen and on the next screen
- You will be prompted to create an API Key for the Service Account (optional)

5. (Optional) Create API Key

- It is recommended to create an API Key for the Service Account right after you create the Service Account, though you can create/manage API Keys for Service Accounts at any time.
- See the API Key [documentation](/cloud/api-keys) for more information on creating and managing API Keys.

#### Using tcld

To create a Service Account using tcld, use the `tcld service-account create` command:

```
tcld service-account create -d "this is a test SA" -n "sa_test"
```

This example creates a Service Account with a name (`-n`) of "sa_test", a description (`-d`) "this is a test SA" and an Account Role of Read.

Creating a Service Account requires the following attributes: name and account-role.
