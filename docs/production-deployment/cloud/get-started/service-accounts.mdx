Temporal Cloud provides Account Owner and Global Admin [roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) with the option to create machine identities named Service Accounts.

Service Accounts are a type of identity in Temporal Cloud.
Temporal Cloud supports User identities as a representation of a human user who uses Temporal Cloud.
Service Accounts afford Temporal Cloud Account Owner and Global Admin [roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) the ability to create an identity for machine authentication, an identity not associated with a human user.

With the addition of Service Accounts, Temporal Cloud now supports 2 identity types:

- Users (tied to a human, identified by email address or ID)
- Service Accounts (not tied to a human, email address optional, identified by name or ID)

Service Accounts use API Keys as the authentication mechanism to connect to Temporal Cloud.
You should use Service Accounts to represent a non-human identity when authenticating to Temporal Cloud for operations automation or the Temporal SDKs and the Temporal CLI for Workflow Execution and management.

## Get started

To get started with Service Accounts, ensure you are Temporal Cloud user.

**Prerequisites:**

- A Cloud user account with Account Owner or Global Admin [role](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) permissions
- Access to the Temporal Cloud UI or Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld)
- Enable access to API Keys for your Account
- To manage Service Accounts using the Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld), upgrade to the latest version of tcld (v0.18.0 or higher) using `brew upgrade tcld`.
  - If using a version of tcld less than v0.31.0, enable Service Account commands with `tcld feature toggle-service-account`.

## Managing Service Accounts

Account Owner and Global Admin [roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) can manage Service Accounts by creating, viewing, updating, deleting Service Accounts using the following tools:

- Temporal Cloud UI
- Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld)
  - Use `tcld service-account --help` for a list of all service-account commands

Account Owner and Global Admin [roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) also have the ability to manage API Keys for Service Accounts.

### Create a Service Account

Create a Service Account using the Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.
While User identities are invited to Temporal Cloud, Service Accounts are created in Temporal Cloud.

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Click the `Create Service Account` button located near the top right of the `Identities` page
3. Provide the following information:
   - **Name** (required)
   - **Description** (optional)
   - **Account Level Role** (required)
   - **Namespace Permissions** (optional)
     - Use this section of the Create Service Account page to grant the Service Account access to individual Namespaces
4. Click `Create Service Account` at the bottom of the page
   - A status message is displayed at the bottom right corner of the screen and on the next screen
   - You will be prompted to create an API Key for the Service Account (optional)
5. (Optional) Create API Key
   - It is recommended to create an API Key for the Service Account right after you create the Service Account, though you can create/manage API Keys for Service Accounts at any time
   - See the API Key [documentation](/cloud/api-keys) for more information on creating and managing API Keys

#### Using tcld

To create a Service Account using tcld, use the `tcld service-account create` command:

```
tcld service-account create -n "sa_test" -d "this is a test SA" --ar "Read"
```

This example creates a Service Account with the name `"sa_test"`, description `"this is a test SA"`, and a `Read` Account Role.

Creating a Service Account requires the following attributes: `name` and `account-role` (as above).
You can also provide the Namespace Permissions for the Service Account using the `â€”-np` flag.
Creating a Service Account returns the `ServiceAccountId` which is used to retrieve, update, or delete a Service Account.

### View Service Accounts

View a single or all Service Account(s) using the Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.

#### Using the Cloud UI

Service Accounts are listed on the `Identities` section of the `Settings` page, along with Users.
To locate a Service Account:

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Select the `Service Accounts` filter

#### Using tcld

To view all Service Accounts in your account using tcld, use the `tcld service-account list` command:

```
tcld service-account list
```

### Delete a Service Account

Delete a Service Account using the Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Find the relevant Service Account
3. Click the three vertical dots in the Service Account row
4. Select `Delete` from the menu displayed
5. Confirm the delete action when prompted

#### Using tcld

To delete a Service Account using tcld, use the `tcld service-account delete` command:

```
tcld service-account delete --service-account-id "e9d87418221548"
```

Use the tcld Service Account list command to validate the Service Account has been removed from the account.
The Service Account is deleted when it is no longer visible in the output of .

### Update a Service Account {#update}

Update a Service Account's description using the Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.

#### Using the Cloud UI

1. Navigate to https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/identities
2. Find the relevant Service Account
3. Click the three vertical dots in the Service Account row
4. Select `Edit` from the menu displayed
5. Make changes to the Service Account
   - You can change the Service Account's name, description, Account Level Role, and Namespace Permissions
6. Click the `Save` button located in the bottom left of the screen
   - A status message is displayed at the bottom right corner of the screen

#### Using tcld

Three different commands exist to help users update a Service Account using tcld:

- `tcld service-account update`: to update a Service Account's name or description field
- `tcld service-account set-account-role`: to update a Service Account's Account Role
- `tcld service-account set-namespace-permissions`: to update a Service Account's Namespace Permissions

Example:

```
tcld service-account update --id "2f68507677904e09b9bcdbf93380bb95" -d "new description"
```

## Namespace Scoped Service Accounts {#scoped}

There is a special type of Service Account, called a Namespace Scoped Service Account, which shares the
same functionality as the Service Accounts above, but is limited (or scoped) to a single namespace.

In particular, a Namespace Scoped Service Account must _always_ have:

- A `Read` Account Role
- A single Namespace Permission

Note that a Namespace Scoped Service Account cannot be reassigned to a different Namespace after creation, but its Namespace Permission can be modified (e.g. from `Read` to `Write`).

Namespace Scoped Service Accounts are useful in situations when you need to restrict a client's access to a single Namespace.

You can retrieve, update, and delete a Namespace Scoped Service Account using the same process and commands as above, but creation is slightly different.

### Create a Namespace Scoped Service Account

As with regular Service Accounts, Namespace Scoped Service Accounts can be created using Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.

#### Using the Cloud UI

Currently, creating a Namespace Scoped Service Account from the Temporal Cloud UI happens on an individual [Namespace](/cloud/namespaces#manage-namespaces) page.
If the current Namespace has API key authentication enabled, then there will be a `Generate API Key` button as a banner on the top of the Namespace page or in the `Authentication` section.

By clicking on the `Generate API Key` button, a Namespace Scoped Service Account will be automatically created for the given Namespace (if one does not already exist) and an associated API key will be displayed.

The resulting Namespace Scoped Service Account will be named `<namespace>-service-account` and will have an `Admin` Namespace Permission by default.

#### Using tcld

To create a Namespace Scoped Service Account with tcld, use the `tcld service-accounted create-scoped` command:

```
tcld service-account created-scoped -n "test_scoped_sa" --np "foo=Admin"
```

This example creates a Namespace Scoped Service Account for the Namespace `foo`, named `"sa_scoped_test"`, with an `Admin` Namespace Permission.
Note that the Account Role is omitted, since Namespace Scoped Service Accounts always have a `Read` Account Role.

### Lifecycle

When a Namespace is deleted, all associated Namespace Scoped Service Accounts are automatically deleted as well.
Therefore, you do not need to manually remove Namespace Scoped Service Accounts after deleting a Namespace.
