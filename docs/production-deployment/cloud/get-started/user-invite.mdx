:::caution
Access to Temporal Cloud can be authorized through email and password, Google single sign-on, Microsoft single sign-on, or SAML, depending on your setup.

If you are using Google OAuth for single sign-on and an email address is not associated with a Google Account, the user must follow the instructions in the [Use an existing email address](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en#existingemail) section of [Create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441).

**Important:** Do _not_ create a Gmail account when creating a Google Account.

If your organization uses Google Workspace or Microsoft Entra ID, and your IT administrator has enabled controls over single sign-on permissions, then you will need to work with your IT administrator to allow logins to Temporal Cloud.

:::

When a user is created in Temporal Cloud, they receive an invitation email with a link.
They must use this link to finalize their setup and access Temporal Cloud.
Accounts with SAML configurations can ignore this email.
However, those using Google/Microsoft SSO or email and password authentication need to accept the invitation link for their initial login to Temporal Cloud.
For future logins, they must use the same authentication method they originally signed up with.

:::info

To invite users, a user must have the Global Admin or Account Owner account-level [role](/cloud/users#account-level-roles).

Each user in Temporal Cloud is assigned a role.
Each user can be assigned permissions for individual Namespaces.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can the same email be used across different Temporal Cloud accounts?

No — each email address can only be associated with a single Temporal Cloud account.
If you need access to multiple accounts, you’ll need a separate invite for each one using a different email address.

#### Can I use Google or Microsoft SSO after signing up with email and password?

If you originally signed up for Temporal Cloud using an email and password, you won’t be able to log in using Google or Microsoft single sign-on.

If you prefer SSO, ask your Account Owner to delete your current user and send you a new invitation.
During re-invitation, be sure to sign up using your preferred authentication method.

#### How do I complete the `Secure Your Account` step?

If you signed up to Temporal Cloud using an email and password, you're required to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
Currently, only authenticator apps are supported as an additional factor (such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, and Authy).

To proceed:

1. Download a supported authenticator app on your mobile device.
2. Scan the QR code shown on the **Secure Your Account** screen.
3. Enter the verification code from your app to complete MFA setup.
4. Securely store your recovery code.
   This code allows you to access your account if you lose access to your authenticator app.

Once MFA is configured, you’ll be able to continue using Temporal Cloud.

#### What if I lose access to my authenticator app?

If you lose access to your authenticator app, you can still log in by clicking **Try another method** on the MFA screen.
From there, you can either:

- Enter your recovery code (provided when you first set up MFA)
- Receive a verification code through email

Once you're logged in, you can reset your authenticator app by navigating to **My Profile** > **Password and Authentication** and then clicking **Authenticator App** > **Remove method**.

#### How do I reset my password?

If you're currently logged in and would like to change your password, click your profile icon at the top right of the Temporal Cloud UI,
navigate to **My Profile** > **Password and Authentication**, and then click **Reset Password**.

If you're not currently logged in, navigate to the login page of the Temporal Cloud UI, enter your email address, click **Continue**, and then select **Forgot password**.
In both cases, you will receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password.
