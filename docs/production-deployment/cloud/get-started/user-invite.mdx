:::caution
Access to Temporal Cloud can be authorized via Google single sign-on, Microsoft single sign-on, email and password, or SAML, depending on your setup.

If you are using Google OAuth for single sign-on and an email address is not associated with a Google Account, the user must follow the instructions in the [Use an existing email address](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en#existingemail) section of [Create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441).

**Important:** Do _not_ create a Gmail account when creating a Google Account.

If your organization uses Google Workspace or Microsoft Entra ID, and your IT administrator has enabled controls over single sign-on permissions, then you will need to work with your IT administrator to allow logins to Temporal Cloud.

:::

When a user is created in Temporal Cloud, they receive an invitation email with a link.
They must use this link to finalize their setup and access Temporal Cloud.
Accounts with SAML configurations can ignore this email.
However, those using Google/Microsoft SSO or email and password authentication need to accept the invitation link for their initial login to Temporal Cloud.
For future logins, they must use the same authentication method they originally signed up with.

:::info

To invite users, a user must have the Global Admin or Account Owner account-level [role](/cloud/users#account-level-roles).

Each user in Temporal Cloud is assigned a role.
Each user can be assigned permissions for individual Namespaces.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I reset my password?

If you're currently logged in and would like to change your password, click your profile icon at the top right of the Temporal Cloud UI,
navigate to **My Profile** > **Password and Authentication**, and then click **Reset Password**.

If you're not currently logged in, navigate to the login page of the Temporal Cloud UI, enter your email address, click **Continue**, and then select **Forgot password**.
In both cases, you will receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password.

#### How do I continue past the Secure Your Account screen?

If you signed up to Temporal Cloud using an email and password, you're required to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
Currently, only authenticator apps are supported as an additional factor (e.g. Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy).

To proceed:

1. Download a supported authenticator app on your mobile device.
2. Scan the QR code shown on the **Secure Your Account** screen.
3. Enter the verification code from your app to complete MFA setup.
4. Securely store your recovery code. This code allow you to access your account if you lose access to your authenticator app.

Once MFA is configured, you’ll be able to continue using Temporal Cloud.

#### How do I login with email and password if I misplace my device or authenticator app?

If you lose access to your authenticator app, you can still login by clicking **Try another method** on the MFA screen.
From there, you can either:

- Enter your recovery code (provided when you first set up MFA)
- Receive a verification code via email

Once you're logged in, you can reset your authenticator app by navigating to **My Profile** > **Password and Authentication** and then clicking **Authenticator App** > **Remove method**.

#### What does the `password_user_exists` error code mean?

This error indicates that you originally signed up for Temporal Cloud using an email and password, but you’re trying to log in using Google or Microsoft single sign-on, which isn’t supported.

To resolve this:

- If you intended to use your email and password, return to the Temporal Cloud login screen, enter your email address, and click **Continue**.
- If you prefer to use Google or Microsoft SSO instead, ask your Account Owner to delete your existing user and re-invite you.
  During re-invitation, be sure to sign in using your preferred authentication method.
