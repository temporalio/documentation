## API key overview {#overview}

Each Temporal Cloud API key is a unique identity linked to role-based access control (RBAC) settings to ensure secure and appropriate access.

The authentication process follows this pathway:

    title="API key (authentication) → Identity (user or Service Account) → RBAC (authorization)"
/>

## API key best practices {#best-practices}

- **Keep it secret; keep it safe**: Treat your API key like a password.
  Do not expose it in client-side code, public repositories, or other easily accessible locations.
- **Rotate keys regularly**: Change your API keys periodically to reduce risks from potential leaks.
- **Design your code for key updates**: Use key management practices that retrieve your API keys without hard-coding them into your apps.
  This lets you restart your Workers to refresh your rotated keys without recompiling your code.
- **Monitor API key usage**: Check usage metrics and logs regularly.
  Revoke the key immediately if you detect any unexpected or unauthorized activity.
- **Use a Key Management System (KMS)**: Employ a Key Management System to minimize the risk of key leaks.

### API key use cases

API keys are used for the following scenarios:

- _**Cloud operations automation**_:
  API keys work with most Temporal Cloud operational tools, including [`tcld`](/cloud/tcld), [Cloud Ops APIs](/ops), and [the Terraform provider](/production-deployment/cloud/terraform-provider).
  Use them to manage your Temporal Cloud account, Namespaces, certificates, and user identities.
- _**Namespace authentication**_:
  API keys serve as an authentication mechanism for executing and managing Workflows via the SDK and Temporal CLI, offering an alternative to mTLS-based authentication.

### API key supported tooling

Use API keys to authenticate with:

- [The Temporal CLI](/cli)
- [Temporal SDKs](/develop)
- [`tcld`](/production-deployment/cloud/tcld/index.mdx)
- [The Cloud Operations API](/production-deployment/cloud/operation-api.mdx)
- [Temporalʼs Terraform provider](/production-deployment/cloud/terraform-provider)

### API key permissions

API keys support both users and Service Accounts.
Here are the differences in their permissions:

- Any user can create, delete, and update their own API key access using the Cloud UI or `tcld`.
- Only Global Administrators and Account Owners can create, delete, and update access to API keys for Service Accounts.

### API key prerequisites

Check these setup details before using API keys:

- The Global Administrator or Account Owner may need to [enable API keys access](#manage-api-keys) for your Temporal Account.
- Have access to the [Temporal Cloud UI](https://cloud.temporal.io/) or Temporal Cloud CLI ([tcld](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/)) to create an API key.

## Global Administrator and Account Owner API key management {#manage-api-keys}

Global Administrators and Account Owners can monitor, manage, disable, and delete API keys for any user or Service Account within their account.
To manage your account’s API keys:

1. [Log in](https://cloud.temporal.io/) to the Temporal Cloud UI.
1. [Select **Settings** and choose **API keys**](https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/api-keys).

Administrators can disable the creation of new API keys using the **Disable API Keys** button on the **API Keys** Settings page.
Existing API keys can still be used to authenticate into Temporal Cloud normally until they are either disabled, deleted, or expired.

To disable or delete an individual API key use the vertical ellipsis next to the API key row or view the API key detail page.

To find an API key, you can filter by API key state and identity type (Global Administrators and Account Owners only).

:::caution DISABLED API KEYS

Deleting or disabling a key removes its ability to authenticate into Temporal Cloud.
If you delete or disable an API key for a running Workflow, that Workflow will fail until a new API key secret is created and configured.

:::

## User API key management {#user-api-keys}

Manage your personal API keys with the Temporal Cloud UI or `tcld`.
These sections show you how to generate, manage, and remove API keys for a user.

### Generate an API key

Create API keys using one of the following methods:

:::caution

- Once generated, copy and securely save the API key.
  It will be displayed only once for security purposes.

:::

#### Generate API keys with the Temporal Cloud UI

[Log in](https://cloud.temporal.io/) to the Temporal Cloud UI and navigate to your [Profile Page → API keys](https://cloud.temporal.io/profile/api-keys).
Then select **Create API key** and provide the following information:

- API key name: a short identifiable name for the key
- API key description: a longer form description of the key's use
- Expiration date: the end-date for the API key

Finish by selecting **Generate API key**.

#### Generate API keys with tcld

To generate an API key, log into your account and issue the following command:

```command
tcld login
tcld apikey create \
    --name <api-key-name> \
    --description "<api-key-description>" \
    --duration <api-key-duration>
```

Duration specifies the time until the API key expires, for example: "30d", "4d12h", etc.

### Enable or Disable an API Key

You can enable or disable API keys.
When disabled, an API key cannot authenticate with Temporal Cloud.

#### Manage API Key State with the Temporal Cloud UI

Follow these steps:

1. [Log in](https://cloud.temporal.io/) to the Temporal Cloud UI.
1. Go to your [Profile Page → API Keys](https://cloud.temporal.io/profile/api-keys).
1. Select the three vertical dots next to the API key’s row.
1. Choose **Enable** or **Disable**.

#### Manage API Key State with tcld

To manage an API key, log into your account and use one of the following commands to enable or disable it:

```command
tcld login
tcld apikey disable --id <api-key-id>
tcld apikey enable --id <api-key-id>
```

### Delete an API key

Deleting an API key stops it from authenticating with Temporal Cloud.

:::caution

Deleting an API key for a running Workflow will cause it to fail unless you rotate the key with a new one.
This can affect long-running Workflows that outlast the API key's lifetime.

:::

#### Delete API keys with the Temporal Cloud UI

Follow these steps to remove API keys:

1. [Log in](https://cloud.temporal.io/) to the Temporal Cloud UI.
1. Navigate to your [Profile Page → API keys](https://cloud.temporal.io/profile/api-keys).
1. Select the three vertical dots next to the API key's row.
1. Choose **Delete**.

#### Delete API keys with tcld

To delete an API key, log into your account and issue the following:

```command
tcld login
tcld apikey delete --id <api-key-id>
```

### Rotate an API key

Temporal API keys automatically expire based on the specified expiration time.
Follow these steps to rotate API keys:

1. Create a new key.
   You may reuse key names if that helps.
1. Ensure that both the original key and new key function properly before moving to the next step.
1. Switch clients to load the new key and start using it.
1. Delete the old key after it is no longer in use.

## Manage API keys for Service Accounts {#serviceaccount-api-keys}

Global Administrators and Account Owners can manage API keys for all Service Accounts in their account and generate API keys for Service Accounts.
This is different for users, who generate their own API keys.

### Generate an API Key for a Service Account

Create API keys for Service Accounts using one of the following methods:

:::caution

- Once generated, copy and securely save the API key.
  It will be displayed only once for security purposes.

:::

#### Generate API Keys with the Temporal Cloud UI

[Log in](https://cloud.temporal.io/) to the Temporal Cloud UI and go to [API keys settings](https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/api-keys).
Select **Create API key**, then choose **Service Account** from the "Create an API key for" dropdown.
In the "Mapped to identity" input box, select a Service account and provide the following information:

- **API key name**: A short, identifiable name for the key
- **API key description**: A longer description of the key's use
- **Expiration date**: The end date for the API key

Finish by selecting **Generate API key**.

#### Generate API keys with tcld

To create an API key for a Service Account, use `tcld apikey create` with the `--service-account-id` flag:

```
tcld apikey create \
    --name <api-key-name> \
    --description "<api-key-description>" \
    --duration <api-key-duration> \
    --service-account-id <service-account-id>
```

### Enable or disable an API key

Global Administrators and Account Owners can manage API key access for any user in their account using the Temporal Cloud UI or `tcld`.

#### Manage keys with Temporal Cloud UI

Follow these steps:

1. Log into Temporal Cloud.
1. Go to [https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/api-keys](https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/api-keys) and find the identity that owns the API key.
1. Click the Disable/Enable button to perform the action.
   There may be a delay after changing the status.
   Once successful, the updated API key status will be shown in the row.

#### Manage keys with tcld

Use the `tcld apikey disable` or `tcld apikey enable` command to disable or enable an API key:

```
tcld login
tcld apikey disable --id <api-key-id>
tcld apikey enable --id <api-key-id>
```

This command is the same for users and Service Accounts.

### Delete an API key for a Service Account

Global Administrators and Account Owners can delete API keys for any user or Service Account in their account using the Temporal Cloud UI or `tcld`.
Deleting a key removes its ability to authenticate with Temporal Cloud.
If you delete an API key for a running Workflow, that Workflow will fail unless you rotate the API key with a new one.

#### Delete a Service Account API key with Temporal Cloud UI

Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/api-keys](https://cloud.temporal.io/settings/api-keys).
1. Locate the identity that owns the API key and click on the row to view the API keys associated with that identity.
1. Click the Delete button.
   There may be a delay after deleting the API key.
1. Once successful, the updated API key status will be reflected in the row.

#### Delete a Service Account API key with tcld

Use the `tcld apikey delete` command to delete an API key.
The process for deleting an API key is the same for a user or Service Account.

```
tcld login
tcld apikey delete --id <api-key-id>
```

### Rotate a Service Account API key

Temporal API keys automatically expire based on the specified expiration time.
Follow these steps to rotate API keys:

1. Create a new key.
   You may reuse key names if that helps.
1. Ensure that both the original key and new key function properly before moving to the next step.
1. Switch clients to load the new key and start using it.
1. Delete the old key after it is no longer in use.

:::tip

Service Accounts can rotate their own API keys irrespective of their configured permissions.
To use this feature, have your Service Account create a new API key using the [Cloud Ops APIs](/ops) or [`tcld`](/cloud/tcld) before the current one expires.
Service Accounts cannot delete their own API keys without the requisite permissions, which helps keep Workflow access secure.

:::

## API keys for Namespace authentication {#namespace-authentication}

Create a Namespace with API key authentication as an alternative to mTLS-based authentication by selecting "Allow API key authentication" during setup.
The gRPC endpoint format for the Namespace depends on the authentication method:

- For API key connections, use the gRPC regional endpoint `<region>.<cloud_provider>.api.temporal.io:7233`.

Use this gRPC endpoint in the Temporal CLI or SDK to connect to Temporal Cloud with an API key.

:::info

For [Namespaces with High Availability features](/cloud/high-availability) with API key authentication enabled, use the gRPC Namespace endpoint: `<namespace>.<account>.tmprl.cloud:7233`.
This allows automated failover without needing to switch endpoints.

:::

See the following documentation for [accessing Namespaces](/cloud/namespaces#access-namespaces) for more information.

## Use API keys to authenticate {#using-apikeys}

Authenticate with Temporal Cloud using API keys with the following clients:

- [Temporal CLI](/cli)
- [SDKs](/develop)
- [Temporal Cloud CLI `tcld`](/production-deployment/cloud/tcld/index.mdx)
- [The Cloud Operations API](/production-deployment/cloud/operation-api.mdx)
- [Temporal’s Terraform Provider](/production-deployment/cloud/terraform-provider)

### Temporal CLI

To use your API key with the Temporal CLI, either pass it with the `--api-key` flag or set an environment variable in your shell (recommended).
The CLI automatically picks up the `TEMPORAL_API_KEY` environment variable from your shell.

In addition to the API key, the following client options are required:

- `--address`: Provide the Namespace's gRPC endpoint from the Namespace UI's gRPC endpoint box.
  - For API key connections, use the format `<region>.<cloud_provider>.api.temporal.io:7233`.
  - You can set the address using an environment variable.
- `--namespace`: Provide the `namespace.accountId` from the top of the Namespace page in the UI.
  - Use the format `<namespace_id>.<account_id>`.
  - This can be set using an environment variable.
- `--tls`: Use for a secure connection with the appropriate options.
  - This can be set using an environment variable.

For example, to connect to Temporal Cloud from the CLI using an environment variable for the API key:

```bash
export TEMPORAL_API_KEY=<key-secret>
temporal workflow list \
    --address <endpoint> \
    --namespace <namespace_id>.<account_id> \
    --tls
```

:::tip ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Do not confuse environment variables, set with your shell, with temporal env options.
