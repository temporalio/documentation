- [**Deploy Workers to Amazon EKS**](/cloud/deploy-workers-to-aws-eks)
  Containerize your Worker, publish it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and deploy it to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) using the Temporal Python SDK.
  This guide covers the full deployment lifecycle and shows how to configure your Worker to connect to Temporal Cloud using Kubernetes-native tools like ConfigMaps and Secrets.
