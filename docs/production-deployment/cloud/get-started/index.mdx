Getting started with Temporal Cloud involves a few key steps to ensure your environment is set up correctly.
However you're using Temporal, begin the process by covering essential tasks, such as account setup, Namespace creation, authentication configuration, and Worker deployment.

You’ll find links here to help you configure your Temporal Cloud account, authenticate your Clients and Workers, and set up the necessary infrastructure to get your Workflows running efficiently.

## Sign up for Temporal Cloud

To create a Temporal Cloud account, you can:

- Sign up [on our site](https://temporal.io/get-cloud); or
- Subscribe at the AWS Marketplace for [Temporal Cloud Pay-As-You-Go](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-xx2x66m6fp2lo).
  Signing up through the AWS Marketplace is similar to signing up directly on the Temporal Cloud site, but billing goes through your AWS account.
- To purchase Temporal Cloud on the Google Cloud Marketplace, please contact our team at sales@temporal.io.

For information about Temporal Cloud Pricing, see our [Pricing Page](/cloud/pricing).

## Accept Account Owner permissions

After sign-up, you will receive email from Temporal welcoming you to your new Temporal account.
Your email address is now the first [Account Owner](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) for your account.

**An Account Owner**:

- Has full administrative permissions across the account, including users, usage, and billing
- Has Namespace Admin permissions on all Namespaces in the account

## Establish your authentication credentials

Temporal Cloud supports both TLS and API key authentication.
The following two sections explain these approaches.

### TLS authentication and certificates

For TLS authentication, you must provide your own CA certificates.
These certificates are used to create a Namespace, which in turn used grants Temporal Clients and Workers access to it.
For certificate requirements, see the following:

- [Requirements for CA certificates](/cloud/certificates#certificate-requirements)
- [Issue root CA and end-entity certificates](/cloud/certificates#issue-certificates)

### API keys

To enable and use API key access, see the following:

- [API key overview](/cloud/api-keys#overview)
- [API key best practices](/cloud/api-keys#best-practices)
- [Troubleshoot your API key use](/cloud/api-keys#troubleshooting)
- [API keys: Frequently Asked Questions](/cloud/api-keys#faqs)

### Authentication and SDKs {#auth-and-sdks}

Each SDK has a way to use your CA certificates and private keys to authenticate and authorize access to your Temporal Cloud Namespace.

- [Connect to Temporal Cloud in Java](/develop/java/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud in Python](/develop/python/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud in TypeScript](/develop/typescript/core-application#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud in .NET](/develop/dotnet/temporal-client#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud in PHP](/develop/php/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)

## Create a Namespace

If you don’t have a Namespace yet--or want to create an additional one--[create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/namespaces#create-a-namespace) using the Temporal Cloud UI or the `tcld` CLI.
If using mTLS authentication, don't forget to follow the step that has you add the CA certificate to the Namespace.

## Invite users

Adding a user to your Temporal Cloud Account dispatches an email invite, which users must accept to join.
To add users, see [How to invite users to your Temporal Cloud account](/cloud/users#invite-users).

import InvitationContent from '@site/docs/production-deployment/cloud/get-started/user-invite.mdx'

## Connect to Temporal Cloud

After having updated your Temporal Client and your Workers to [use your Temporal Cloud Namespace credentials](#auth-and-sdks), you can deploy your Workers, so they are ready to execute your Workflows and Activities:

### SDK-specific Worker configuration

- [Run a Temporal Cloud Worker in TypeScript](/develop/typescript/core-application#run-a-temporal-cloud-worker)
