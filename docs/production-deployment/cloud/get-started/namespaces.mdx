## What is a Cloud Namespace Name? {#temporal-cloud-namespace-name}

A Cloud Namespace Name is a customer-supplied name for a [Namespace](/namespaces) in Temporal Cloud.
Each Namespace Name, such as `accounting-production`, is unique within the scope of a customer's account.
It cannot be changed after the Namespace is provisioned.

Each Namespace Name must conform to the following rules:

- A Namespace Name must contain at least 2 characters and no more than 39 characters.
- A Namespace Name must begin with a letter, end with a letter or number, and contain only letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character.
- Each hyphen (-) character must be immediately preceded _and_ followed by a letter or number; consecutive hyphens are not permitted.
- All letters in a Namespace Name must be lowercase.

## What is a Temporal Cloud Account ID? {#temporal-cloud-account-id}

A Temporal Cloud Account ID is a unique customer identifier assigned by Temporal Technologies.
Each Id is a short string of numbers and letters like `f45a2`, at least five characters long.
This account identifier is retained throughout the time each customer uses Temporal Cloud.

At times you may need to know your customer Account ID.
Accessing the account's Namespaces provides an easy way to capture this information.
Each Temporal Namespace use an Account ID suffix.
This is the alphanumeric character string found after the period in any Temporal Cloud Namespace name.

You can retrieve an Account ID from the [Temporal Cloud](https://cloud.temporal.io) Web UI or by using the `tcld` utility at a command line interface (CLI).
Follow these steps.

<Tabs>

    <TabItem value="webui" label="Web UI">
    Follow these steps to retrieve your Account ID:

    1. Log into Temporal Cloud.
    1. Select your account avatar at the top right of the page.
       A profile dropdown menu appears.
    1. Copy the Cloud Account ID from the menu.
       <ZoomingImage
           src="/img/cloud/cloud-guide/cloud-account-id.png"
           alt="Temporal Cloud user profile dropdown menu. The dropdown includes a Cloud Account ID and copy button, with role, profile and logout options, and links to community resources."
       />

    In this example, the Account ID is `123de`.

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="tcldcli" label="tcld">
    1. Use the `tcld` utility to log into an account.

       ```
       tcld login
       ```

       The `tcld` output presents a URL with an activation code at the end. Take note of this code. The utility blocks until the login/activation process completes.

       ```
       Login via this url: https://login.tmprl.cloud/activate?user_code=KTGC-ZPWQ
       ```

       A Web page automatically opens for authentication in your default browser.

    1. Visit the browser.
       Ensure the user code shown by the CLI utility matches the code shown in the Web browser.
       Then, click Confirm in the browser to continue.
       After confirmation, Web feedback lets you know that the CLI "device" is now connected.

    1. Return to the command line.
       Issue the following command.

       ```
       tcld namespace list
       ```

       The CLI tool returns a short JSON packet with your namespace information.
       This is the same list found in the Temporal Cloud Web UI Namespaces list.
       Like the browser version, each Namespace uses an Account ID suffix.

       ```
       {
         "namespaces": [
           "your-namespace.123de",
           "another-namespace.123de"
         ],
         "nextPageToken": ""
       }
       ```

    Each Namespace automatically appends an Account ID suffix to its customer-supplied identifier.
    This five-character-or-longer string appears after the name, separated by a period.
    In this Namespace listing sample, the Account ID is 123de.

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## What is a Cloud Namespace Id? {#temporal-cloud-namespace-id}

A Cloud Namespace Id is a globally unique identifier for a [Namespace](/namespaces) in Temporal Cloud.
A Namespace Id is formed by concatenating the following:

1. A [Namespace Name](#temporal-cloud-namespace-name)
1. A period (.)
1. The [Account ID](#temporal-cloud-account-id) to which the Namespace belongs

For example, for the Account ID `123de` and Namespace Name `accounting-production`, the Namespace Id is `accounting-production.123de`.

## What is a Cloud gRPC Endpoint? {#temporal-cloud-grpc-endpoint}

Temporal Clients communicate between application code and a Temporal Server by sending and receiving messages via the gRPC protocol.
gRPC is a Remote Procedure Call framework featuring low latency and high performance.
gRPC provides Temporal with an efficient, language-agnostic communication framework.

Every Temporal Namespace uses a gRPC endpoint for communication.
When migrating to Temporal Cloud, you'll need to switch the gRPC endpoint in your code from your current hosting, whether self-hosted or locally-hosted, to Temporal Cloud.

A gRPC endpoint appears on the detail page for each Cloud Namespace.
Follow these steps to find it:

1. Log into your account on [cloud.temporal.io](https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces).
2. Navigate to the Namespace list page from the left-side vertical navigation.
3. Tap or click on the Namespace Name to select and open the page for the Namespace whose endpoint you want to retrieve.
4. On the Namespace detail page, click on the "Connect" button in the top right corner of the page.
5. Click the copy icon next to the gRPC address to copy it to your clipboard.

See [How to access a Namespace in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/namespaces/#access-namespaces) for more information on different gRPC endpoint types and how to access them.

## What are some Namespace best practices? {#best-practices}

This section provides general guidance for organizing [Namespaces](/namespaces) across use cases, services, applications, or domains.
Temporal Cloud provides Namespace–as-a-service, so the Namespace is the endpoint.
Customers should consider not only a Namespace naming convention but also how to group or isolate workloads using the Namespace as a boundary.

Each team can have their own Namespace for improved modularity, security, debugging, and fault isolation.
Namespaces contain the blast radius of misbehaving Workers that may exhaust rate limits.
Sensitive Workflow state (PCI data) can be secured with per-Namespace permissions and encrypted with a separate encryption key.

Temporal Applications in different Namespaces may be connected with [Nexus](/cloud/nexus) by exposing a clean service contract for others to use with built-in [Nexus access controls](/cloud/nexus/security).
Nexus supports cross-team, cross-domain, multi-region, and multi-cloud use cases.

### Constraints and limitations

Before considering an appropriate Namespace configuration, you should be aware of the following constraints:

- By default, each account is allocated with a limit of ten Namespaces.
  As you create and use your Namespaces, for example by scheduling Workflows, Temporal Cloud automatically raises your limit.
  Our service identifies your usage patterns.
  It responds by slowly increasing your allowance, up to 100 Namespaces.
  You can request further increases beyond the 100 Namespace limit by opening a [support ticket](/cloud/support#support-ticket).
- Each Namespace has a rate limit, which is measured in Actions per second (APS).
  A namespace may be throttled when its throughput becomes too high.
  Throttling means limiting the rate at which actions are performed to prevent overloading the system.
  A Namespace's default limit is set at 400 APS and automatically adjusts based on recent usage (over the prior 7 days).
  Your APS limit will never fall below this default value.
- Each Namespace has a default service-level agreement (SLA) of 99.9% uptime.
- You can opt-in to using [High Availability features](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/high-availability) with a 99.99% contractual SLA.
- A Namespace is a security isolation boundary.
  Access to Temporal by [Worker Processes](/workers#worker-process) is permitted at the Namespace level.
  Isolating applications or environments (development, test, staging, production) should take this into consideration.
- A Namespace is provisioned with an endpoint for executing your Workflows.
  Accessing a Namespace from a Temporal Client requires [API keys](/cloud/api-keys) or [mTLS](/cloud/certificates) authentication.
- [Workflow Id](/workflow-execution/workflowid-runid#workflow-id)uniqueness is per Namespace.
- [Task Queue](/task-queue) names are unique per Namespace.
- Closed Workflow retention is per Namespace.
- RBAC [permissions](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions) are implemented at the Namespace level.

### General guidance

Namespace configuration requires some consideration.
Following are some general guidelines to consider.

- Namespaces are usually defined per use case.
  A use case can encompass a broad range of Workflow types and a nearly unlimited scale of concurrent [Workflow Executions](/workflow-execution).
- Namespaces can be split along additional boundaries such as service, application, domain or even sub-domain.
- Environments such as production and development usually have requirements for isolation.
  We recommend that each environment has its own Namespace.
- Namespaces should be used to reduce the "blast radius" for mission-critical applications.
- Workflows that need to communicate with each other should (for now) be in the same Namespace.
- If you need to share Namespaces across team or domain boundaries, be sure to ensure the uniqueness of Workflow Ids.

### Examples

Following are some ideas about how to organize Namespaces.

#### Example 1: Namespace per use case and environment

We recommend using one Namespace for each use case and environment combination for simple configurations in which multiple services and team or domain boundaries don't exist.

Sample naming convention:

<pre>&lt;use-case>_&lt;environment></pre>

#### Example 2: Namespace per use case, service, and environment

We recommend using one Namespace for each use case, service, and environment combination when multiple services that are part of same use case communicate externally to Temporal via API (HTTP/gRPC).

Sample naming convention:

<pre>&lt;use-case>_&lt;service>_&lt;environment></pre>

#### Example 3: Namespace per use case, domain, and environment

We recommend using one namespace per use case, domain, and environment combination when multiple services that are part of the same use case need to communicate with each another via [Signals](/sending-messages#sending-signals) or by starting [Child Workflows](/child-workflows).
In this case, though, you must be mindful about Workflow Id uniqueness by prefixing each Workflow Id with a service-specific string.
The name of each Task Queue must also be unique.
If multiple teams are involved, the domain could also represent a team boundary.

Sample naming convention:

<pre>&lt;use-case>_&lt;domain>_&lt;environment></pre>

Sample workflowId convention:

<pre>&lt;service-string>_&lt;workflow-id></pre>

## How to access a Namespace in Temporal Cloud {#access-namespaces}

{/* How to access a Namespace in Temporal Cloud */}

Temporal Cloud normally supports authentication to Namespaces using [API keys](/cloud/api-keys) _or_ [mTLS](/cloud/certificates).
If you need to migrate from one authentication method to another, or you require both API key and mTLS authentication to be enabled on your Namespace, please contact [Support](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/support#support-ticket).

See the documentation for [API keys](/cloud/api-keys) and [mTLS certificates](/cloud/certificates) for more information on how to create and manage your credentials.

Authentication methods require specific endpoints in order to programmatically access your Namespace.

- For the API key authentication method, use the gRPC regional endpoint `<region>.<cloud_provider>.api.temporal.io:7233`.
- For the mTLS authentication method, use the gRPC Namespace endpoint `<namespace>.<account>.tmprl.cloud:7233`.
- For [Namespaces with High Availability features](/cloud/high-availability) use the gRPC Namespace endpoint `<namespace>.<account>.tmprl.cloud:7233`, regardless of your authentication method.
  This allows automated failover without needing to switch your endpoint.

For information on how to connect to Clients using a specific authentication method see the following documentation.

- To use API keys to connect with the [Temporal CLI](/cli), [Client SDK](/develop), [tcld](/cloud/tcld), [Cloud Ops API](/ops), and [Terraform](/production-deployment/cloud/terraform-provider), see [Use API keys to authenticate](/cloud/api-keys#using-apikeys).
- To use mTLS to connect with the [Temporal CLI](/cli) and [Client SDK](/develop), see [Configure Clients to use Client certificates](/cloud/certificates#configure-clients-to-use-client-certificates).

For accessing the Temporal Web UI, use the HTTPS endpoint in the form: `https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces/<namespace>.<account>`.
For example: `https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces/accounting-production.f45a2`.

To ensure the security of your data, all traffic to and from your Namespace is encrypted.
However, for enhanced protection, you have additional options:

- (recommended) Set up private connectivity by [creating a ticket for Temporal Support](/cloud/support#support-ticket).
- Set up your allow list for outgoing network requests from your Clients and Workers with the IP address ranges of the Cloud Provider region in which your Namespace is located:
  - [AWS IP address ranges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ip-ranges.html)
  - [GCP IP address ranges](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/faq#find_ip_range)

{/* How to manage Namespaces in Temporal Cloud using tcld */}

### Manage Namespaces in Temporal Cloud using tcld

To list Namespaces and get information about them, use the following [tcld](/cloud/tcld/) commands:

- [tcld namespace list](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#list)
- [tcld namespace get](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#get)

To manage certificates, use the [tcld namespace accepted-client-ca](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#accepted-client-ca) commands.
For more information, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates).

To manage certificate filters, use the [tcld namespace certificate-filters](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#certificate-filters) commands.
For more information, see [How to manage certificate filters in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates#manage-certificate-filters).

## How to delete a Namespace in Temporal Cloud {#delete-a-namespace}

:::info

To delete a Namespace, a user must have Namespace Admin [permission](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions) for that Namespace.

:::

### Delete a Namespace using Temporal Cloud UI

1. Go to the Temporal Cloud UI and log in.
1. On the left side of the window, select **Namespaces**.
1. On the **Namespaces** page, select a Namespace Name.
1. On the Namespace page, select **Edit** in the upper-right portion of the window.
1. On the **Edit** Namespace page, select **Delete Namespace** in the upper-right portion of the window.
1. In the **Delete Namespace** dialog, type `DELETE` to confirm the deletion of that Namespace.
1. Select **Delete**.

After deleting a Temporal Cloud Namespace, the Temporal Service immediately removes the Namespace's Workflow Executions and Task Queues.
Make sure all Workflows have been completed, canceled, or terminated before removing a Namespace.
The Namespace removal is permanent.

Closed Workflow Histories remain in Temporal storage until the user-defined retention period expires.
This period reflects the policy in effect when the Workflow Execution was closed.

For further questions or concerns, contact [Support](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/support#support-ticket).

### Delete a Namespace using tcld

See the [tcld namespace delete](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#delete) command reference for details.

### Namespace deletion protection {#delete-protection}

To prevent accidental Namespace deletion, Temporal Cloud provides a protection feature.
When you enable Deletion Protection for your production environment Namespace, you ensure that critical data won't be deleted unintentionally.

Follow these steps:

- Visit the [Namespaces page](https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces) on Temporal Cloud.
- Open your Namespace details page.
- Select the Edit button.
- Scroll down to Security and click the disclosure button (downward-facing caret).
- Enable **Deletion Protection**

<CaptionedImage
    src="/img/cloud/namespace/deletion-protection.png"
    title="Deletion Protection is enabled by toggling the switch"
/>

To enable or disable this feature using [`tcld`](/cloud/tcld), use the following command.
Set the value to `true` to enable or `false` to disable:

```
tcld namespace lifecycle set \
    --namespace <namespace_id.account_id> \
    --enable-delete-protection <Boolean>
```
