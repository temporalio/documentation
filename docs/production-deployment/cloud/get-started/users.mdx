## What are the account-level roles for users in Temporal Cloud? {#account-level-roles}

When an Account Owner or Global Admin invites a user to join an account, they select one of the following roles for that user:

- **Global Admin**
  - Has full administrative permissions across the account, including users and usage
  - Has Namespace Admin [permissions](#namespace-level-permissions) on all [Namespaces](/namespaces) in the account. This permission cannot be revoked
- **Developer**
  - Can create Namespaces
  - Is granted [Namespace Admin](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions) permission for each Namespace created. This permission can be revoked
  - Can create Nexus Endpoints where they are a [Namespace Admin](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions) on the target Namespace
- **Read-Only:** Can only read information and be granted Namespace permissions

In addition, there are two roles that the Global Admin cannot assign:

- **Account Owner**
  - Has full administrative permissions across the account, including users, usage and [billing](/cloud/billing-and-cost)
  - Has Namespace Admin [permissions](#namespace-level-permissions) on all [Namespaces](/namespaces) in the account
- **Finance Admin**
  - Has permissions to view [billing](/cloud/billing-and-cost) information and update payment information
  - Otherwise, has the same permissions as Account Read-only users
  - Can only be assigned by an Account Owner

:::note Default Role

When the account is created, the initial user who logs in is automatically assigned the Account Owner role.
If your account does not have an Account Owner, please reach out to [Support](https://temporalsupport.zendesk.com/) to assign the appropriate individual to this role.

:::

## Using the Account Owner role

The Account Owner role (i.e., users with the Account Owner system role) holds the highest level of access in the system.
This role configures account-level parameters and manages Temporal billing and payment information.
It allows users to perform all actions within the Temporal Cloud account.

:::tip Best Practices

Temporal strongly recommends the following precautions when assigning the Account Owner role to users:

- Assign the role to at least two users in your organization.
  Otherwise, limit the number of users with this role.
- Associate a person’s direct email address to the Account Owner, rather than a shared or generic address, so Temporal Support can contact the right person in urgent situations.

This latter rule is useful for anyone on your team who may need to be contacted urgently, regardless of their Account role.

## What are the Namespace-level permissions for users in Temporal Cloud? {#namespace-level-permissions}

An Account Owner or Global Admin can assign permissions for any [Namespace](/namespaces) in an account.
A Developer can assign permissions for a Namespace they create.

For a Namespace, a user can have one of the following permissions:

- **Namespace Admin:**
  - Can [manage the Namespace](/cloud/namespaces#manage-namespaces) including identities and permissions
  - Can create, rename, update, and delete [Workflows](/workflows) within the Namespace
- **Write:**
  - Can create, rename, update, and delete [Workflows](/workflows) within the Namespace
- **Read-Only:**
  - Can only read information from the Namespace

## How to update an account-level role in Temporal Cloud {#update-roles}

With Global Admin or Account Owner privileges, you can update any user's account-level [role](#account-level-roles) using either the Web UI or the tcld CLI utility.
The Account Owner role can only be granted by existing Account Owners.

For security reasons, changes to the Account Owner role must be made through Temporal Support.
To change or delete an Account Owner, you must submit a [support ticket](https://temporalsupport.zendesk.com/).
