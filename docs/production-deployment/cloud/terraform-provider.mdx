  - The Terraform Provider is in a Public Preview release status for Temporal Cloud.
---

The Terraform Temporal Cloud provider allows you to use Terraform to manage resources for Temporal Cloud.
The Terraform tool manages infrastructure as code (IaC).
With this provider, you can use Terraform to automate Temporal Cloud resource management, including Namespaces, Users, Service Accounts, API Keys and more.

:::note Terraform Management

Once a resource is managed by Terraform, you should only use Terraform to manage that resource.

:::

Resources:

- The [Temporal Cloud Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/temporalio/temporalcloud/latest) is available in the Terraform Registry, where you can find detailed documentation on the Provider's supported resources and data sources.
- The GitHub repository for the Terraform provider is [terraform-provider-temporalcloud](https://github.com/temporalio/terraform-provider-temporalcloud/tree/main), where you can report bugs, provide feature requests, and [contribute](https://github.com/temporalio/terraform-provider-temporalcloud/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the provider.
  We encourage your input as we develop the provider with the community.
- To view the list of available Temporal Cloud resources supported by Terraform provider, visit the resources section of the Terraform documentation in Hashi's [registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/temporalio/temporalcloud/latest/docs).

:::info AWS-only Regions

The Terraform Provider currently supports Temporal Cloud deployments in AWS regions.
Support for Temporal on GCP is in development.

:::

### Prerequisites

To use the Terraform provider, you'll need the following:

- A [Terraform account](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform)
- The [Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli)
- An [API Key](/cloud/api-keys): an API Key is required to use the Terraform provider.
  - See [the API docs](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/api-keys#generate-an-api-key) for instructions on generating an API Key.

:::note OpenTofu Registry

Our Terraform Provider is registered with [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org), but that registration is not maintained or managed by Temporal Technologies.

:::

## Setup

Generate an [API Key](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/api-keys#generate-an-api-key) to authenticate Terraform operations with your Temporal Cloud account or a Service Account.
Then, either use an environmental variable or pass the API Key into the provider manually to manage your Temporal Cloud Terraform resources.

Follow these examples to use an environmental variable to pass in your API Key to the provider.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS" default>
Export your environment variable for secure access to the API Keys.

```bash
# replace <your-secret-key> with the "secretKey": output from tcld apikey create command
export TEMPORAL_CLOUD_API_KEY=<your-secret-key>
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
Export your environment variable for secure access to the API Keys.

```bash
# replace <your-secret-key> with the "secretKey": output from tcld apikey create command
set TEMPORAL_CLOUD_API_KEY=<your-secret-key>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or, pass it in manually in your .tf file using the provider code block

```yml
provider "temporalcloud" {
  api_key = "my-temporalcloud-api-key"
}
```

## Manage Temporal Cloud Namespaces with Terraform

Terraform is a great way to automate the management of Temporal Namespaces.
It doesn't matter whether you want management to be centralized within a platform team or federated to different product teams.
The provider allows you to can import, create, update, and delete Namespaces with Terraform.

You must use an Identity with Temporal Cloud Namespace management privileges.
This includes the Account Owner, Global Admin, or Developer Account Role.

:::info Support, stability, and dependency info

Temporal Cloudâ€™s Terraform provider currently does not support [multi-region Namespaces](/cloud/multi-region) or [GCP regions](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/service-availability#gcp).

:::

**How do I create a Namespace with Terraform?**

1. Create a Terraform configuration file (`terraform.tf`) to define a Namespace.

   ```yml
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       temporalcloud = {
         source = "temporalio/temporalcloud"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "temporalcloud" {

   }

   resource "temporalcloud_namespace" "namespace" {
     name               = "terraform"
     regions            = ["aws-us-east-1"]
     accepted_client_ca = base64encode(file("ca.pem"))
     retention_days     = 14
   }
   ```

   In this example, you create a Temporal Cloud Namespace named `terraform`, specifying the AWS region `aws-us-east-1`, and specifying the path to the CA certificate.

1. Initialize the Terraform provider.

   Run the following command to initialize the Terraform provider.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

1. Apply the Terraform configuration.

   Once initialization occurs, apply the Terraform configuration to your Temporal Cloud account.

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

Follow the onscreen prompts.

Upon completion, you'll see a success message indicating your Namespace is created.

```bash
temporalcloud_namespace.terraform: Creation complete after 2m17s [id=<your-namespace>]
```

You can find more examples of Namespace management in the Terraform Provider docs located on HashiCorp's [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/temporalio/temporalcloud/latest/docs/resources/namespace).
The Terraform Provider docs show how to generate CA certs within Terraform configuration files and create a Namespace with API Key based authentication.

**How do I validate the creation of the Namespace?**

You can validate the creation of the Namespace through the Temporal Web UI or through the `tcld namespace get` command.

**Using the Temporal Web UI**

1. Log into the Temporal Cloud Web UI.
1. Navigate to the Namespaces page.
1. Search for the Namespace you created.

**Using the tcld CLI utility**

Validate the creation of your Namespace through the Terraform provider.
To validate see your Namespace in the Cloud UI or through the `tcld namespace get` command.
Run the `tcld namespace get` command and pass in your [Cloud Namespace Name](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-namespace-name) and [Cloud Account Id](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-account-id):

```bash
tcld namespace get -n "<your-namespace>.<your-account-id>"
```

**How do I update a Temporal Cloud Namespace?**

Terraform automatically recognizes changes made within `.tf` files and applies those changes to Temporal.

For example, change the retention period setting in the Terraform file from the previous example and watch Terraform apply the change without any additional steps required by you.

1. Set the retention period to 30 days.

   ```yml
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       temporalcloud = {
         source = "temporalio/temporalcloud"
         version = ">= 0.0.6"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "temporalcloud" {

   }

   resource "temporalcloud_namespace" "namespace" {
     name               = "terraform"
     regions            = ["aws-us-east-1"]
     accepted_client_ca = base64encode(file("ca.pem"))
     retention_days     = 30
   }
   ```

1. Apply your configuration.
   When prompted, answer yes to continue:

   ```command
   terraform apply
   ```

Upon completion, you will see a success message indicating your Namespace has been updated.
It may take several minutes to update a Namespace.

```text
temporalcloud_namespace.namespace: Modifications complete after 10s [id=terraform.a1bb2]
```

**How do I delete a Temporal Cloud Namespace?**

To delete the Namespace, run the following command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

:::note Preventing Deletion

You can prevent deletion of any Terraform resource by including the `prevent_destroy` argument in the Terraform configuration file.

:::

**How do I import a Temporal Cloud Namespace?**

If you have an existing Namespace in Temporal Cloud, you can import it into Terraform to manage the Namespace from Terraform using the `terraform import` command.

1. Provide a configuration placeholder in your Terraform configuration.

   ```yml
   resource "temporalcloud_namespace" "namespace" {
   }
   ```

1. Run the `terraform import` command from the command line and pass in the Namespace ID.
   Your Namespace ID is available at the top of the Namespace's page in the Temporal Cloud UI and is in the format `namespaceid.acctid`.

   ```bash
   terraform import temporalcloud_namespace.terraform namespaceid.acctid
   ```

The Namespace is now a part of the Terraform state and all changes to the Namespace should be managed by Terraform.
Once a resource has been imported into Terraform, outside changes to the resource will create Terraform "drift" errors on subsequent Terraform operations.

## Manage Temporal Cloud Users with Terraform

Manage Temporal Cloud Users with the same process you use to manage Namespaces with Terraform.
The following examples create, update, delete, and import Temporal Cloud Users with `terraform apply` commands on the Terraform configuration file.

:::note User Management

Cautions about Temporal User management:

- Terraform can't manage the Temporal Account Owner role.
  While you can import an Account Owner to Terraform, you cannot create, update, or delete an Account Owner with Terraform.
- Right now, you can't manage a user's access to a Namespace from the Namespace resource.
  You must manage Namespace access from the User resource.
  This is also true for Service Accounts.
- Account Owners and Global Admins automatically gain access to all Namespaces in Temporal.
  Therefore, you cannot specify Namespace access for these roles.
  This is also true for Service Accounts.
- Follow Terraform best practices for resource management.
  Manage a specific user in one and only one .tf file.
  There's a risk that you may overwrite a user's permissions if you don't.
- To Import a user, you'll need the User's ID which is currently not available in the Temporal Cloud UI.
  You can fetch current User ID by running the `tcld user list` command.

:::

**How do I create a Temporal Cloud User with Terraform?**

1. Add a Terraform User resources configuration to your Terraform file.

   ```yml
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       temporalcloud = {
         source = "temporalio/temporalcloud"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "temporalcloud" {

   }

   resource "temporalcloud_namespace" "namespace" {
     name               = "terraform"
     regions            = ["aws-us-east-1"]
     accepted_client_ca = base64encode(file("ca.pem"))
     retention_days     = 14
   }

   resource "temporalcloud_user" "global_admin" {
     email          = <admin-email>
     account_access = "Admin"
   }

   resource "temporalcloud_user" "namespace_admin" {
     email          = <developer-email>
     account_access = "Developer"
     namespace_accesses = [
       {
         namespace_id = temporalcloud_namespace.namespace.id
         permission = "Write"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Replace the email and domain values with your Temporal Cloud User email and domain.

1. Apply your configuration.
   When prompted, answer yes to continue:

   ```command
   terraform apply
   ```

Upon completion, you will see a success message indicating your User has been created.

```text
temporalcloud_user.namespace_admin: Creation complete after 1s [id=12a34bc5678910d38d9e8390636e7412]
Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

**How do I update a Temporal Cloud User with Terraform?**

To update a User with Terraform, follow the same steps used to create a User.

**How do I delete a Temporal Cloud User with Terraform?**

To delete a User with Terraform, remove the Terraform User resources configuration from your Terraform file and run the `terraform apply` command.

1. Remove the Terraform User resources configuration from your Terraform file.

   ```yml
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       temporalcloud = {
         source = "temporalio/temporalcloud"
         version = ">= 0.0.6"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "temporalcloud" {

   }

   resource "temporalcloud_namespace" "namespace" {
     name               = "terraform"
     regions            = ["aws-us-east-1"]
     accepted_client_ca = base64encode(file("ca.pem"))
     retention_days     = 14
   }

   resource "temporalcloud_user" "global_admin" {
     email          = <admin-email>
     account_access = "Admin"
   }

   # resource "temporalcloud_user" "namespace_admin" {
   #   email          = <developer-email>
   #   account_access = "Developer"
   #   namespace_accesses = [
   #     {
   #       namespace_id = temporalcloud_namespace.namespace.id
   #       permission = "Write"
   #     }
   #   ]
   # }
   ```

1. Run the `terraform apply` command.
   When prompted, answer yes to continue:

   ```command
   terraform apply
   ```

Upon completion, you will see a success message indicating your User has been deleted.

```text
temporalcloud_user.namespace_admin: Destruction complete after 2s
Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
```

**How do I import a Temporal User?**
If you have an existing User in Temporal Cloud, you can import it into Terraform using the `terraform import` command.

1. Provide a configuration placeholder in your Terraform configuration.

   ```yml
   resource "temporalcloud_user" "user" {
   }
   ```

````
1. Run the `terraform import` command and pass in the User ID
 Your User ID is available using the Temporal Cloud CLI `tcld u l` command.

 ```bash
 terraform import temporalcloud_user.user 72360058153949edb2f1d47019c1e85f
````

The User is now a part of the Terraform state and all changes to the User should be managed by Terraform.

## Manage Temporal Cloud Service Accounts with Terraform

The process and steps to managing a Service Account with Terraform are very similar to managing a User with Terraform with a few small differences:

- Service Accounts use the Service Account Terraform resource not the User resource.
- Service Accounts do not have email addresses, they have names instead.
  This means you should specify a name for a Service Account instead of an email.

Everything else about managing Services Accounts with Terraform follows the same process, guidance, and limitations of managing Users with Terraform.

## Manage Temporal Cloud API Keys with Terraform

You can manage your own, personal API Keys and Service Account API Keys with Terraform.
The process and steps to managing an API Key with Terraform are very similar to managing other resources with Terraform.
You can create, delete, update and import API Keys with Terraform.
One difference between working with API Keys as a Terraform resource compared to other Temporal Cloud resources is the need to access an API Keys secure token output from Terraform.
Walk through the process of securely accessing the API Key Token in the Create section of this guide.

:::note Limits and Best Practices

- See the API Key [documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/api-keys) for information about the limits and best practices for managing API Keys.
- See Terraform's documentation on working with [sensitive data](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html#sensitive-values) for more information on how to manage sensitive data in Terraform.

:::

**How do I create a Temporal Cloud API Key with Terraform?**

1. Add a Terraform API Key resources configuration to your Terraform file.

   ```yml
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       temporalcloud = {
         source = "temporalio/temporalcloud"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "temporalcloud" {

   }

   resource "temporalcloud_service_account" "global_service_account" {
     name           = "admin"
     account_access = "Admin"
   }

   resource "temporalcloud_apikey" "global_apikey" {
     display_name = "admin"
     owner_type   = "service-account"
     owner_id     = temporalcloud_service_account.global_service_account.id
     expiry_time  = "2024-11-01T00:00:00Z"
     disabled     = false
   }
   ```

   Make sure to:

   - Replace the display_name, expiry_time, and disabled values with your Temporal Cloud API Key configuration.
   - Replace the owner_type and owner_id values with your Temporal Cloud Service Account or other Identity information.

1. Create an output.tf file and add the following code to output the API Key Token.

   ```yml
   output "apikey_token" {
     value = temporalcloud_apikey.global_apikey.token
     sensitive = true
   }
   ```

1. Apply your configuration.
   When prompted, answer yes to continue:

   ```command
   terraform apply
   ```

   Upon completion, you will see a success message indicating the API Key has been created.

   ```text
   temporalcloud_apikey.global_apikey: Creation complete after 1s [id=kayBf38JIWkMPmnfr59iEIaEk2L7uqR4]
   ```

1. Access the API Key Token securely.
   You'll notice that if you view the state for the API Key resource, the token value is not displayed.

   ```bash
   terraform state show temporalcloud_apikey.global_apikey

   # temporalcloud_apikey.global_apikey:
   resource "temporalcloud_apikey" "global_apikey" {
       disabled     = false
       display_name = "adminKey3"
       expiry_time  = "2024-12-01T00:00:00Z"
       id           = "kayBf38JIWkMPmnfr59iEIaEk2L7uqR4"
       owner_id     = "b81336a6097449cba75c2e5500df3d31"
       owner_type   = "service-account"
       state        = "active"
       token        = (sensitive value)
   }
   ```

To access the token, you can use the Terraform output command.

```bash
terraform output -json apikey_token
```

This will display the token value in the terminal.

:::info Security and API Keys

Remember, keep your Terraform state files secure if you're managing API Keys with Terraform.
The state file contains sensitive information, like the API Key Token, that should not be shared or exposed.

:::

**How do I update a Temporal Cloud API Key with Terraform?**

To update an API Key with Terraform, follow the same steps used to create an API Key.

:::note Editing Fields

You can only edit an API Key's name or description field.
Updating an API Key does not generate a new secure token

:::

**How do I delete a Temporal Cloud API Key with Terraform?**

To delete an API Key with Terraform, remove the Terraform API Key resources configuration from your Terraform and output.tf files and run the `terraform apply` command.

**How do I Import a Temporal API Key?**

You cannot import an API Key into Terraform.
Once created, the API Key secret isn't stored and can't be retrieved, so you can't access it using import.

Instead, Temporal recommends creating a new API Key using Terraform directly.

## Data Sources - Regions and Namespaces

The Terraform provider also supports 2 data sources that provide you access to the available Regions and Namespaces in your Temporal Cloud account.

:::note Terraform Data Sources

See Terraform [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources) to learn more about Terraform Data Sources

:::

For example, to retrieve a list of regions available for your account, you can use the regions data_source

```yml
data "temporalcloud_regions" "regions" {}

output "regions" {
  value = data.temporalcloud_regions.regions.regions
}
```
