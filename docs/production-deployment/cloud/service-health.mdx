Temporal Cloud metrics help monitor the Service health of production deployments.
This documentation covers best practices for monitoring Service health.

## Monitoring availability issues

When you see a sudden drop in Worker resource utilization, verify whether Temporal Cloud's API is showing increased latency and error rates.

### Reference Metrics

- [temporal\_cloud\_v0\_service\_latency\_bucket](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_bucket)

This metric measures latency for `SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution`, `SignalWorkflowExecution`, `StartWorkflowExecution` operations.
These are all considered mission critical operations and are [never throttled](/cloud/service-availability#throughput), so this metric should be a good indicator of your lowest possible latency.

### Prometheus Query for this Metric

P99 service lag (histogram):

```
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_service_latency_bucket[$__rate_interval])) by (temporal_namespace, operation, le))
```

## Monitoring Temporal Service errors

Check for Temporal Service gRPC API errors.
Note that Service API errors are not equivalent to guarantees mentioned in the [Temporal Cloud SLA](/cloud/sla).

### Reference Metrics

- [temporal\_cloud\_v0\_frontend\_service\_error\_count](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_error_count)
- [temporal\_cloud\_v0\_frontend\_service\_request\_count](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_request_count)

### Prometheus Query for this Metric

Measure your daily average errors over 10-minute windows:

```
avg_over_time((
    (

        (
            sum(increase(temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_request_count{temporal_namespace=~"$namespace", operation=~"StartWorkflowExecution|SignalWorkflowExecution|SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution|RequestCancelWorkflowExecution|TerminateWorkflowExecution"}[10m]))
            -
            sum(increase(temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_error_count{temporal_namespace=~"$namespace", operation=~"StartWorkflowExecution|SignalWorkflowExecution|SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution|RequestCancelWorkflowExecution|TerminateWorkflowExecution"}[10m]))
        )
        /
        sum(increase(temporal_cloud_v0_frontend_service_request_count{temporal_namespace=~"$namespace", operation=~"StartWorkflowExecution|SignalWorkflowExecution|SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution|RequestCancelWorkflowExecution|TerminateWorkflowExecution"}[10m]))
    )
    
    or vector(1)

    )[1d:10m])
```

## Monitoring multi-region Namespace replication lag

Replication lag refers to the transmission delay of Workflow updates and history events from the active region to the standby region.
Always check the [metric replication lag](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_bucket) before initiating a failover.
A forced failover when there is a large replication lag has a higher likelihood of rolling back Workflow progress.

**Who owns the replication lag?**
Temporal owns replication lag.

**What guarantees are available?**
There is no SLA for replication lag.
Temporal recommends that customers do not trigger failovers except for testing or emergency situations.
Multi-region's four-9 guarantee SLA means Temporal will handle failovers and ensure high availability.
Temporal also monitors replication lag.
Customer who decide to trigger failovers should look at this metric before moving forward.

**If the lag is high, what should you do?**
We don't expect users to failover.
Please contact Temporal support if you feel you have a pressing need.

**Where can you read more?**
See [multi-region Namespaces](/cloud/multi-region).

### Reference Metrics

- [temporal\_cloud\_v0\_replication\_lag\_bucket](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_bucket)
- [temporal\_cloud\_v0\_replication\_lag\_sum](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_sum)
- [temporal\_cloud\_v0\_replication\_lag\_count](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_count)

### Prometheus Query for this Metric

P99 replication lag (histogram):

```
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_bucket[$__rate_interval])) by (temporal_namespace, le))
```

Average replication lag:

```
sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_sum[$__rate_interval])) by (temporal_namespace)
/
sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_count[$__rate_interval])) by (temporal_namespace)
```
