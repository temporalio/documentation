Enabling SCIM requires that SAML already be configured for your account. See the [SAML](/cloud/saml) guide for instructions on
how to setup SSO with SAML.

This feature is in pre-release and subject to change. Currently only Okta is supported as the upstream IDP.

### How to configure SCIM with Okta {#configure-scim-with-okta}

To enable SCIM on your account, you will need to [create a support ticket](/cloud/support#support-ticket). 
There are a few things to prepare before starting the process:

1. Configure [SAML](/cloud/saml) SSO
1. Ensure that all critical traffic is configured to authenticate via mTLS or API keys attached to
system accounts. This ensures that workflows will continue uninterrupted if there is a problem with the integration.
1. Determine an Okta administrator who will be configuring the SCIM integration. The administrator will receive
an email with a configuration link allowing them to setup the integration.

Once these steps have been completed, you can [submit a support ticket](/cloud/support#support-ticket) to enable SCIM. Onboarding consists of
the following steps:

1. Temporal Support will enable the SCIM integration on your account, which will trigger a configuration link to
be sent to your Okta administrator.
1. Your Okta administrator will use the supplied link, which includes step-by-step instructions, to configure
the integration.
1. Once configured in Okta, Temporal Cloud will begin to receive SCIM messages and automatically onboard and offboard
the users and groups configured in Okta.

User and group change events are applied within 10 minutes of them being made in Okta. 
User lifecycle management with SCIM also allows user roles to be derived from group membership. 
Once a group has been synced in Temporal Cloud, you can use `tcld` to assign roles to the group. 
For instructions, see the [User Group Management documentation](https://github.com/temporalio/tcld?tab=readme-ov-file#user-group-management).
