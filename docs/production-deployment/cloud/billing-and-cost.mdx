The Account Owner holds the ability to access and view detailed billing and cost information at any time, ensuring full transparency and control over financial aspects. If you need to assess your spending patterns, check invoice histories, or handle payment details, Temporal Cloud's Cost and Billing capabilities are able to provide the information you need.

On the **Billing** page, you can find the following details:

- [Current Balance](#current-balance): Your balance accrued thus far in the billing cycle
- [Recent bill](#recent-bill): The amount of your most recent bill
- [Invoice history](#invoice): A record of all past invoices
- Credit information: If applicable, details about any credit grants, purchases, usage, and remaining credits.

If you are not on a standard plan, the Billing page may not include all of the information stated above. 

## How to navigate to your invoices

To review your invoices, follow these steps:

1. Click **Settings** on your left sidenav.
2. Select the **Billing** tab.
3. Under the **Invoices** section, download the invoice(s) you wish to review.

## Current balance {#current-balance}

The current balance card displays the balance accrued thus far in the billing cycle. You will see the date when this data was last updated. Note, this information will change based on usage. This data also corresponds to the first line in the Invoices table. 

The typical billing cycle begins on the first of the month (UTC). The minimum support fee for your first month is prorated based on when you sign up.

## Recent bill {#recent-bill}

The recent bill card displays the last bill amount. If you are paying invoices through the Stripe portal, you will see a **Pay Now** button. The **Pay Now** button will take you to the Stripe portal for you to complete your payment. If the account is set up for auto-payment, no action is required to pay the bill manually, but it’s available if needed. 

## Invoice table {#invoice}

For the current date or billing period, you will not have the download invoice option available as the Invoice has not been finalized. 

The Invoices table has the following information: 

- Date (UTC) - date range for the invoice
- Type - Invoice type, credit purchase or cloud usage
- Credit Granted - Amount of credits added to your account
- Credit Purchase Amount - Amount paid for credits purchase
- Credit Usage - Amount of credits used this billing cycle
- Subtotal - Invoice amount
- Balance due - Balance remaining after credits are granted

You have the ability to download your Invoices by clicking the download icon by the date.
