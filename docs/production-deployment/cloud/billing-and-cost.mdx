Temporal strives to provide full transparency over billing and costs.
Account Owners and Finance Admins can view their [detailed billing information](https://cloud.temporal.io/billing) at any time.
Use this information to assess your spending patterns, inspect your credit ledger, check your invoice histories, or update payment details as needed.

For more information on Temporal Cloud pricing for Actions, storage, and services/support, please visit our [Pricing](/cloud/pricing) page.

The [billing](https://cloud.temporal.io/billing) page includes the following information.
If you're not on a standard plan, your billing page may show a subset of this list:

- [Current balance](#current-balance): Your balance to date for this billing cycle
- [Recent bill](#recent-bill): The amount of your most recent bill
- [Invoice history](#invoice): Access to all past invoices
- [Credit ledger](#credit-table): A record of all credit related transactions including details on credit grants, purchases, usage, and remaining credits, if applicable

The [Usage](https://cloud.temporal.io/usage) page shows the cost breakdown by Namespace.
If your organization separates projects by Namespace -- for architectural reasons, for development/production differentiation, for different products, etc -- you can view individual costs for each Namespace.

## Current balance {#current-balance}

Your current balance card shows the balance for your current billing cycle and the date it was last updated.

Billing cycles normally begin on the first of the month (UTC).
The minimum support fee for your first month is prorated based on your sign-up date.
