Audit Logging is a feature of [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/overview) that provides forensic access information for a variety of operations in the Temporal Cloud control plane.

Audit Logging answers "who, when, and what" questions about Temporal Cloud resources.
These answers can help you evaluate the security of your organization, and they can provide information that you need to satisfy audit and compliance requirements.

You need the Account Owner or Global Administrator role to view audit logs via UI, use the API, or to configure an Audit Log sink.

:::info

Audit Logging does NOT capture data plane events, like Workflow Start, Workflow Terminate, Schedule Create, etc.
Instead, explore the [Export](/cloud/export) feature, which does let you send closed Workflow Histories to external storage.

### Audit Log format

:::info DEPRECATION NOTICE

The following fields are deprecated and are planned for removal on or after April 1 2026. 

- `user_email`.  This field is duplicated by `principal.name` for principals of type `user`. Other principal types do not have associated emails.
- `level`.  This field is duplicated by `status`.
- `caller_ip_address`.  This field is replaced by `x_forwarded_for`.
- `details`.  This field is replaced by `raw_details` that includes request details.
- `category`.  This field is no longer used.

:::

Audit Logs use the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "operation":  // Operation that was performed
  "principal": // Information about who initiated the operation
  "details":  // DEPRECATED, see raw_details
  "raw_details": // details about the request
  "user_email":  // DEPRECATED, use principal.user where applicable
  "x_forwarded_for": // the IP address making the call
  "caller_ip_address": // DEPRECATED, use x_forwarded_for
  "category":  // DEPRECATED, no longer used
  "emit_time": // Time the operation was recorded
  "level": // DEPRECATED, use status
  "log_id": // Unique ID of the log entry
  "request_id": // Optional async request id set by the user when sending a request
  "status": // Status, such as OK or ERROR
  "version": // Version of the log entry
}
```

:::note

The [`X-Forwarded-For`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For) format is a comma-separated list of IP addresses which should be evaluated from the last to the first, until meeting the first untrusted IP address of the list. This allows for instance to consider proxies in the path.

Temporal provides the caller IP address in that format to allow customers to identify a caller IP address even if one (or more proxies) are in the network path to reach Temporal Cloud.

## How to configure an Audit Log sink {#configure-audit-logging}

Audit logging can be configured in AWS Kinesis or GCP Pub/Sub.

- [AWS Kinesis Instructions](/cloud/audit-logging-aws)
- [GCP Pub/Sub Instructions](/cloud/audit-logging-gcp)

## How to troubleshoot Audit Log sink {#troubleshoot-audit-logging}

The Audit Logging page of the Temporal Cloud UI provides the current status of an Audit Log sink.

- If an error is detected, a summary of the error appears below the page title.
- If the Audit Log sink is functioning normally, an **On** badge appears next to the page heading.

After an Admin Operation is performed, users can see Audit Log messages flow through the stream.

Upon successful configuration of the Audit Log sink and set up of a stream, you will receive events within the hour of setup.
Temporal is able to retain Audit Log information for up to 30 days.
To retrieve logs up to the past 30 days, you will need to file a request.

If you experience an issue with an Audit Log sink, we can provide the missing audit information.
Open a support ticket to request assistance.

## How to delete an Audit Log sink {#delete-an-audit-log-sink}

To delete an Audit Log sink, follow these steps:

1. In the Temporal Cloud UI, select **Settings**.
1. On the **Settings** page, select **Integrations**.
1. In the **Audit Logging** card, select **Configure Audit Logs**.
1. At the bottom of the **Audit Logging** page, choose **Delete**.

After you confirm the deletion, the Audit Log Sink is removed from your account and logs stop flowing to your stream.


:::note
Audit Log UI and API access is currently in public preview.
:::

## View an Audit Log {#view-an-audit-log}

An Audit Log can be viewed in the Temporal Cloud UI.
1. In the Temporal Cloud UI, select **Settings**.
1. On the **Settings** page, select **Audit Logging**.

Up to 1000 events can be downloaded from the Audit Log UI to a local file.

## Access an Audit Log via API {#audit-log-api}

An Audit Log can be accessed using the [Temporal Cloud Ops API](/ops). Use the API to access
an Audit Log if you wish to make dashboards for viewing an Audit Log outside of Temporal Cloud.
If your goal is to export an Audit Log, it is better to use an Audit Log sink and capture each 
entry as it is generated.

Audit logs are accessible for the past 30 days using the API.

The API allows:
- StartTimeInclusive: Filter for UTC time >= (defaults to 30 days ago) - optional
- EndTimeExclusive: Filter for UTC time < (defaults to current time) - optional
- PageSize: Cannot exceed 1000. Defaults to 100. - optional
- PageToken: The page token if this is continuing from another response - optional
