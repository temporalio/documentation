Keeping services available is crucial in distributed applications, especially during failures or incidents.
Temporal’s replication and automated failover features ensure high availability.
By enabling High Availability replication, you allow Temporal to copy Namespace metadata and Workflow Executions to a <ToolTipTerm term="replica"/>.
This redundancy, combined with failover capability, enhances availability during outages.

## Replication

Replication is the process of copying and synchronizing data or services across Temporal Server deployments.
This ensures availability and consistency in the event of a failure.
Temporal uses replication to support high availability, ensuring that Workflows and data remain available even if parts of the system fail or become unreachable.

In Temporal, replication operates at the Namespace level.
Each Namespace is replicated across <ToolTipTerm term="isolation domains" /> or separate regions.
If one Namespace becomes unavailable, a replica can take over, ensuring that Workflows continue without interruption.

Temporal Cloud replicates both Workflow Execution details and metadata, including configurations such as retention periods, Search Attributes, and other settings.
All parts of the system will eventually synchronize to a consistent view of the Namespace metadata, even if the primary and its replica temporarily lose communication.

<DiscoverableDisclosure label="Workflow replication restrictions">
Temporal Cloud restricts certain Workflow operations to the primary:

- You may only update Workflows in the primary.
- You may only dispatch Workflow Tasks and Activity Tasks from the primary.
  Because of this, forward progress in a Workflow Execution can only be made in the primary.

These limits mean that certain requests, such as Start Workflow and Signal Workflow, are processed by and limited to the primary.
Replicas may receive API requests from Clients and Workers.
They automatically forward these requests to the primary for execution.

Namespaces with High Availability features provide an “all-active” experience for Temporal users.
This helps limit or eliminate downtime during Namespace failover.
There's a short time window from when a replica becomes active to when Clients and Workers receive a DNS update.
During this time requests forward from the now passive (formerly active) primary to the newly active (formerly passive) replica.

As Workflow Executions progress and are operated on, replication Tasks created in the primary are dispatched to the replica.
Processing these replication Tasks ensures that the replica undergoes the same state transitions as the active primary.
This enables replicated tasks to synchronize and achieve the same state as the original tasks.

Replicas do not distribute Workflow or Activity Tasks.
Instead, they perform verification tasks to confirm that intended operations are executed so Workflows reach the desired state.
This mechanism ensures consistency and reliability in the replication process.
