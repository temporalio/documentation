A failover shifts Workflow Execution processing from an active Temporal Namespace region to its replica during outages or other incidents.
This mode of replication duplicates data and prevents data loss during failover.

Temporal Cloud initiates a Namespace failover when it detects an incident or outage that raises error rates or latency in the active region of a Namespace.
The failover shifts Workflow processing to a replica that isn’t affected by the incident.
This lets existing Workflows continue and new Workflows start while the incident is fixed.
Once the incident is resolved, Temporal Cloud performs a "failback" by shifting Workflow Execution processing back to the original region.

:::tip

You can test the failover of your highly available Namespace by manually triggering a failover using the UI or the 'tcld' CLI utility.
In most scenarios, we recommend you let Temporal handle failovers for you.

:::

## Health checks {#health-checks}

Temporal Cloud automates failovers by performing internal health checks.
This process monitors your request error rates, latencies, and any infrastructure issues that might cause service disruptions, such as request timeouts.
It automatically triggers failovers when these indicators exceed our allowed thresholds.

### Replication lag

Temporal Cloud’s High Availability features use asynchronous replication between the active region and the replica.
Workflow updates in the active region, along with associated history events, are transmitted to the replica with a short delay.
This delay is called the replication lag.
Temporal Cloud strives to maintain a P95 replication delay of less than 1 minute.
In this context, P95 means 95% of requests are processed faster than this specified limit.

Replication lags mean a forced failover may cause Workflows to rollback in progress.
Lags may also cause recently started Workflows to be temporarily unavailable until the active region recovers.
Temporal event versioning and conflict resolution mechanisms help guarantee that the Workflow Event History can be replayed.
Critical operations like Signals won't get lost.

## Failover scenarios

The Temporal Cloud failover mechanism supports several modes for executing Namespace failovers.
These modes include graceful failover ("handover"), forced failover, and a hybrid mode.
The hybrid mode is Temporal Cloud’s default Namespace behavior.
The following sections describe each style.

### Graceful failover (handover) {#graceful-failover}

In this mode, Temporal Cloud fully processes and drains replication tasks.
Temporal Cloud pauses traffic to the Namespace before the failover.
Graceful failover prevents the loss of progress and avoids data conflicts.

The Namespace experiences a short period of unavailability, defaulting to 10 seconds.
During this period:

- Existing Workflows stop progress.
- Temporal Cloud returns a "Service unavailable error".
  This error is retryable by the Temporal SDKs.
- State transitions will not happen and tasks are not dispatched.
- User requests like start/signal Workflow are rejected.
- Operations are paused during handover.

This mode favors _consistency_ over availability.

### Forced failover {#forced-failover}

In this mode, a Namespace immediately activates in the standby region.
Events not replicated due to replication lag undergo conflict resolution upon reaching the new active region.

This mode prioritizes *availability* over consistency.

### Hybrid failover mode {#hybrid-failover}

While graceful failovers are preferred for consistency, they aren’t always practical.
Temporal Cloud’s hybrid failover mode (the default mode) limits the initial graceful failover attempt to 10 seconds or less.

During this period:

- Existing Workflows stop progress.
- Temporal Cloud returns a "Service unavailable error", which is retried by SDKs.

If the graceful approach doesn’t resolve the issue, Temporal Cloud automatically switches to a forced failover.

This strategy balances *consistency* and *availability* requirements.

## Replication

High Availability features replicate Namespace metadata and Workflow Executions to a replica.
This redundancy, plus the added failover capability, provides measurable stability when dealing with outages.

A highly available Namespace is normally active in a single region at any moment.
The replica assumes a standby role.

:::caution

An exception to this only occurs in the event of a [network partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_partition).
In this case, you may elect to promote a replica to active status.
_Caution_: this action will temporarily result in both regions being active.
Once the network partition resolves and communication between the regions is restored, a conflict resolution algorithm determines which entity continues as the active one.
This ensures only one region remains active.

:::

### Metadata replication

Updates to highly available Namespace records automatically replicate.
This metadata includes configurations such as retention periods, Search Attributes, and other settings.
Temporal Cloud ensures that all regions will eventually share a consistent and unified view of the Namespace metadata.

:::tip

A Namespace failover, which changes the "active region" field of a Namespace record, is an update.
This update is replicated via the Namespace metadata mechanism.

:::

### Workflow Execution replication

Temporal Cloud restricts certain Workflow operations to the active region:

- You may only update Workflows in the active region.
- You may only dispatch Workflow Tasks and Activity Tasks from the active region.
  Forward progress in a Workflow Execution can therefore only be made in the active region.

These limits mean that certain requests, such as Start Workflow and Signal Workflow, are processed by and limited to the active region.
Replicas may receive API requests from Clients and Workers.
They automatically forward these requests to the active region for execution.

Namespaces with high availability provide an “all-active” experience for Temporal users.
This helps limit or eliminate downtime during Namespace failover.
There's a short time window from when a replica becomes active to when Clients and Workers receive a DNS update.
During this time requests forward from the now passive (formerly active) region to the newly active (formerly standby) replica.

As Workflow Executions progress and are operated on, replication tasks created in the active region are dispatched to the replica.
Processing these replication tasks ensures that the replica undergoes the same state transitions as the active.
This enables replicated tasks to synchronize and achieve the same state as the original tasks.

Replicas do not distribute Workflow or Activity Tasks.
Instead, they perform verification tasks to confirm that intended operations are executed so Workflows reach the desired state.
This mechanism ensures consistency and reliability in the replication process.

### Conflict resolution

Namespaces with replicas rely on asynchronous event replication.
In the event of a non-graceful failover, replication lag may result in a temporary setback in workflow progress.

Single-region Namespaces can be configured to provide at-most-once semantics for Activities execution (when Maximum Attempts is set to 0).
Namespaces with replicas provide at-least-once semantics for execution of Activities.
Completed Activities may be re-dispatched in a newly active region, leading to repeated executions.

When a Workflow Execution is updated in a replica following a failover, events from the previously active region that arrive after the failover can't be directly applied.
At this point, Temporal Cloud has forked the Workflow History.

After failover, Temporal Cloud creates a new branch history for execution, and begins its conflict resolution process.
The Temporal Service ensures that Workflow Histories remain valid and are replayable by SDKs post-failover or after conflict resolution.
This capability is crucial for Workflow Executions to continue their forward progress.

:::caution

Design your activities to succeed once and only once.
This "idempotent" approach avoids process duplication that could withdraw money twice or ship extra orders by mistake.
Run-once actions maintain data integrity and prevent costly errors.
Idempotency keeps operations from producing additional effects.
Protect your processes from accidental or repeated actions for more reliable execution.
