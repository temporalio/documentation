Temporal Cloud automatically initiates failovers when an incident or outage affects a Namespace with High Availability features.
Namespace replicas duplicate data and prevent data loss during failover.

## Perform a manual failover {#triggering-failovers}

For some users, Temporal's automated health checks and failovers don't provide sufficient nuance and control.
For this reason, you can manually trigger failovers based on your own custom alerts and for testing purposes.
This section explains how and what to expect afterward.

:::warning Check Your Replication Lag

Always check the <ToolTipTerm term="replication lag" tooltip="The transmission delay of Workflow updates and history events from the primary to the replica." /> before initiating a failover.
A forced failover when there is a significant replication lag has a higher likelihood of rolling back Workflow progress.

:::

### Trigger the failover {#manual-failovers}

You can trigger a failover manually using the Temporal&nbsp;Cloud<br />Web&nbsp;UI or the tcld CLI, depending on your preference and setup.
The following table outlines the steps for each method:

| Method                                   | Instructions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Temporal&nbsp;Cloud<br />Web&nbsp;UI** | - Visit the [Namespace page](https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces) on the Temporal Cloud Web UI.<br />- Navigate to your Namespace details page and select the **Trigger a failover** option from the menu.<br />- After confirmation, Temporal initiates the failover.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Temporal<br />tcld&nbsp;CLI**          | To manually trigger a failover, run the following command in your terminal:<br /><tt>tcld namespace failover \ </tt><br /><tt><Spacer width={4} />--namespace \<namespace_id>.\<account_id> \ </tt><br /><tt><Spacer width={4} />--region \<target_region></tt><br /><br /> If using API key authentication with the `--api-key` flag, you must add it directly after the tcld command and before `namespace failover`. |

Temporal fails over the primary to the replica.
When you're ready to fail back, follow these failover instructions to move the primary back to the original.

### Post-failover event information {#info}

After any failover, whether triggered by you or by Temporal, an event appears in both the [Temporal Cloud Web UI](https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces) (on the Namespace detail page) and in your audit logs.
The audit log entry for Failover uses the `"operation": "FailoverNamespace"` event.
After failover, the replica becomes active, taking over in the isolation domain or region.

You don't need to monitor Temporal Cloud's failover response in real time.
Whenever there is a failover event, users with the Account Owner and Global Admin roles automatically receive an alert email.

### Returning to the primary with failbacks

After Temporal-initiated failovers, Temporal Cloud shifts Workflow Execution processing back to the original region or isolation domain that was active before the incident once the incident is resolved.
This is called a "failback".

:::note

To failback a manually-initiated failover, follow the [Manual Failover](#manual-failovers) directions to failover back to the original primary.

:::

## Disabling Temporal-initiated failovers {#disabling-temporal-initiated}

When you add a replica to a Namespace, in the event of an incident or an outage Temporal Cloud automatically fails over the Namespace to its replica.
_This is the recommended and default option._

However if you prefer to disable Temporal-initiated failovers and handle your own failovers, you can do so by following these instructions:

| Method                                   | Instructions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Temporal&nbsp;Cloud<br />Web&nbsp;UI** | - Navigate to the Namespace detail page in Temporal Cloud. <br /> - Choose the "Disable Temporal-initiated failovers" option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Temporal<br />tcld&nbsp;CLI**          | To disable Temporal-initiated failovers, run the following command in your terminal:<br /><tt>tcld namespace update-high-availability \ </tt><br /><tt><Spacer width={4} />--namespace \<namespace_id>.\<account_id> \ </tt><br /><tt><Spacer width={4} />--disable-auto-failover=true</tt><br /><br /> If using API key authentication with the `--api-key` flag, you must add it directly after the tcld command and before `namespace update-high-availability` |

Temporal Cloud disables its health-check initiated failovers.
To restore the default behavior, unselect the option in the WebUI or change `true` to `false` in the CLI command.

## Best practices: Workers and failovers {#worker}

Enabling High Availability for Namespaces doesn't require specific Worker configuration.
The process is invisible to the Workers.
When a Namespace fails over to the replica, the DNS redirection orchestrated by Temporal ensures that your existing Workers continue to poll the Namespace without interruption.

When a Namespace fails over to a replica in a different region, Workers will be communicating cross-region.

- If your application can’t tolerate this latency, deploy a second set of Workers in the replica's region or opt for a replica in the same region:
- In the case of a complete regional outage, Workers in the original region may fail alongside the original Namespace.
  To keep Workflows moving during this level of outage, deploy a second set of Workers to the secondary region.

:::tip

Temporal Cloud enforces a maximum connection lifetime of 5 minutes.
This offers your Workers an opportunity to re-resolve the DNS.

## Best practices: scheduled failover testing {#testing}

Microservices and external dependencies will fail at some point.
Testing failovers ensures your app can handle these failures effectively.
Temporal recommends regular and periodic failover testing for mission-critical applications in production.
By testing in non-emergency conditions, you verify that your app continues to function, even when parts of the infrastructure fail.

<DiscoverableDisclosure label="Why test?">

:::tip Safety First

If this is your first time performing a failover test, run it with a test-specific namespace and application.
This helps you gain operational experience before applying it to your production environment.
Practice runs help ensure the process runs smoothly during real incidents in production.

:::

Failover testing (also known as "<ToolTipTerm term="trigger testing" tooltip="Trigger testing means  emulating Temporal's automatic failover trigger after a failing health check."/>") can:

- **Validate replicated deployments**:
  In multi-region setups, failover testing ensures your app can run from another region when the primary region experiences outages.
  In standard setups, failover testing instead works with an isolation domain.
  This maintains high availability in mission-critical deployments.
  Manual testing confirms the failover mechanism works as expected, so your system handles incidents effectively.

- **Assess replication lag**:
  In multi-region deployment, monitoring [replication lag](/cloud/high-availability/monitor#metrics) between regions is crucial.
  Check the lag before initiating a failover to avoid rolling back Workflow progress.
  This is less important when using isolation domains as failover is usually instantaneous.
  Manual testing helps you practice this critical step and understand its impact.

- **Assess recovery time**:
  Manual testing helps you measure actual recovery time.
  You can check if it meets your expected Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 20 minutes or less, as stated in the [High Availability Namespace SLA](/cloud/sla).

- **Identify potential issues**:
  Failover testing uncovers problems not visible during normal operation.
  This includes issues like [backlogs and capacity planning](https://temporal.io/blog/workers-in-production#testing-failure-paths-2438) and how external dependencies behave during a failover event.

- **Validate fault-oblivious programming**:
  Temporal uses a "fault-oblivious programming" model, where your app doesn’t need to explicitly handle many types of failures.
  Testing failovers ensures that this model works as expected in your app.

- **Operational readiness**:
  Regular testing familiarizes your team with the failover process, improving their ability to handle real incidents when they arise.

Testing failovers regularly ensures your Temporal-based applications remain resilient and reliable, even when infrastructure fails.
