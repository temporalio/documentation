Temporal’s High Availability features ensure that your Workflows remain operational, even during disruptions.
The pages in this section provide how-to support for triggering failovers, setting up routing, and more.

[**How do I trigger a failover?**](/cloud/high-availability/failovers)

In certain scenarios, such as testing or proactively managing failovers before Temporal’s automated health checks take over, you can perform manual failovers.
This allows you to switch between primary Namespaces and their replicas, test the failover mechanism, or just stay ahead of Temporal's automatic failovers when it matters.
This is especially useful in environments that require precise control over failover timing or configuration.

[**How do I authenticate with High Availability features?**](/cloud/high-availability/api-authentication)

Temporal Cloud supports Namespace authentication with [API keys](/cloud/api-keys) or [mTLS](/cloud/certificates).

[**How do I resolve DNS?**](/cloud/high-availability/secure-routing)

Resolving a Namespace’s DNS record correctly is an important skill when your Namespace's region or isolation domain changes after failover.

[**How do I set up AWS PrivateLink for High Availability routing?**](/cloud/high-availability/private-link)

For more secure communication, AWS PrivateLink configurations enable you to isolate data transfer between your Temporal instance and your internet services.
This setup enhances the security of your high-availability architecture and helps protect sensitive data while ensuring continuous operations.

This information helps you ensure that your Temporal-based applications remain resilient, scalable, and capable of handling disruptions with minimal impact on performance and availability.
