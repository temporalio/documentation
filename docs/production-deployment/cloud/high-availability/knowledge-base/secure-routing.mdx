When using a Namespace with High Availability features, the Namespace's DNS record `<ns>.<acct>.<tmprl_domain>` targets a regional DNS record in the format `<region>.region.<tmprl_domain>`.
Here, `<region>` is the currently active region for your Namespace.

During failover, Temporal Cloud changes the target of the Namespace DNS record from one region to another.
Namespace DNS records are configured with a 15 second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live">TTL</a>.
Any DNS cache should re-resolve the record within this delay.
As a rule of thumb, receiving an updated DNS reconciliation takes about twice (2x) the TTL.
Clients should converge to the newly targeted region within, at most, a 30-second delay.
