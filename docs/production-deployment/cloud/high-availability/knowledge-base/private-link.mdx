:::important

Some networking configuration is required for failover to be transparent to clients and workers when using PrivateLink.
This page describes how to configure routing for Namespaces with High Availability features for PrivateLink customers only.

:::

PrivateLink customers may need to change certain configurations for multi-region Namespace use.
Routing configuration depends on networking setup and use of PrivateLink.
You may need to:

- override a DNS zone; and
- ensure the network connectivity between the two regions.

![Customer side solution example](/img/cloud/high-availability/private-link.png)

When using PrivateLink, you connect to Temporal Cloud using IP addresses local to your network.
The `region.<tmprl_domain>` zone is configured in the Temporal systems as an independent zone.
This allows you to override it to make sure traffic is routed internally for the regions in use.
You can check the Namespace's active region using the Namespace record CNAME, which is public.

To set up the DNS override, you override specific regions to target the relevant IP addresses (e.g. aws-us-west-1.region.tmprl.cloud to target 192.168.1.2).
Using AWS, this can be done using a private hosted zone in Route53 for `region.<tmprl_domain>`.
Link that private zone to the VPCs you use for Workers.
Private Link is not yet offered for GCP multi-region Namespaces.

When your Workers connect to the Namespace, they first resolve the `<ns>.<acct>.<tmprl_domain>` record.
This targets `<active>.region.<tmprl_domain>` using a CNAME.
Your private zone overrides that second DNS resolution, leading traffic to reach the internal IP you're using.

Consider how you'll configure Workers to run in this scenario.
You might set Workers to run in both regions at all times.
Alternately, you could establish connectivity between the regions to redirect Workers once failover occurs.

The following table lists Temporal's available regions, PrivateLink endpoints, and DNS record overrides.
The `sa-east-1` region listed here is not yet available for use with multi-region Namespaces.
There is (currently) only one region on the continent.
