Temporal’s High Availability features ensure that your Workflows remain operational, even during disruptions.
The pages in this section provide deeper insights and configuration options for managing failovers, securing data transfer, maintaining system stability across regions, and more.

[**Triggering failovers**](/cloud/high-availability/failovers):
In certain scenarios, such as testing or proactively managing failovers before Temporal’s automated health checks take over, you can perform **manual failovers**.
This allows you to switch between primary Namespaces ("the primary") and their replicas, testing the failover mechanism or just stay ahead of Temporal's automatic failovers when it matters.
This is especially useful in environments that require precise control over failover timing or configuration.

[**Monitoring and observability**](/cloud/high-availability/operations):
Monitoring and observability are critical for understanding the health of your high-availability setup and for taking appropriate action when needed.
Temporal provides metrics to track the status of Namespaces with High Availability features.
Temporal integrates with popular monitoring solutions, helping you stay ahead of potential disruptions and ensuring consistent Workflow progress.

[**Secure routing**](/cloud/high-availability/secure-routing) and
[**AWS PrivateLink for High Availability routing**](/cloud/high-availability/private-link):
Resolving a Namespace’s DNS record correctly is an important skill.
For more secure communication, AWS Private Link configurations enable you to isolate data transfer between your Temporal instance and your internet services.
This setup enhances the security of your high-availability architecture and helps protect sensitive data while ensuring continuous operations.

[**High Availability Best Practices**](/cloud/high-availability/best-practices):
To make the most of Temporal’s High Availability features, following best practices is key.
The Best Practices section outlines guidelines for optimal setup, configuration, and troubleshooting to ensure your high-availability infrastructure runs smoothly and remains resilient under load or during outages.

[**Glossary and Concepts**](/cloud/high-availability/concepts):
Familiarizing yourself with the core concepts and definitions is crucial for effectively leveraging High Availability features.
Explore how Temporal's implementation of High Availability features compares to industry standards.

By using these advanced features, monitoring tools, and best practices, you can ensure that your Temporal-based applications remain resilient, scalable, and capable of handling disruptions with minimal impact on performance and availability.
