Temporal Cloud provides high availability features for workloads where availability is critical to your operations.
When you enable these features, Temporal Cloud automatically synchronizes your data between the  primary Namespace information and a <ExpandableDefinition term="replica" definition = "A replica is a synchronized copy of a Namespace. It ensures redundancy, fault tolerance, and minimal downtime during an incident or outage. A replica can take over operations if the primary Namespace becomes unavailable. It's synchronized up to the point of replication lag, where no further data is available." />, keeping them in sync.

In case of an incident or an outage, Temporal will automatically <ExpandableDefinition term="failover" definition = "A failover shifts Workflow Execution processing from a primary  Namespace to a replica during outages or other incidents. Temporal Cloud uses replication to duplicate data and prevent data loss during failover." /> your Namespace from the primary to the replica.
This lets Workflow Executions continue with minimal interruptions or data loss.
Customers can also initiate failovers based on their situational monitoring or for testing.

Returning control from the replica to the primary Namespace is called a failback.
The replica is active for a brief duration during an incident.
Once the incident is done, Temporal fails back to the primary unless the failover was initiated by a user or the automatic failback feature was disabled in settings.

- After failback, the primary Namespace is once again active and replicates to the replica.
- When failback is disabled, the replica begins replicating to the primary Namespace instead.

## Replication and replicas {#replications-and-replicas}

High availability (HA) features in Temporal Cloud simplify deployment, ensuring operational continuity and data integrity even during unexpected events impacting an availability zone (AZ) or a region using a process called Replication.
Replication asynchronously replicates Workflow Executions from an active region to its replica.
Using Temporal Cloud’s HA features, you can create a replica in the same region or in a different region.
In the event of network service or performance issues in the active region, your replica is ready to take over.
Temporal Cloud smoothly transitions control from the active to the replica via a "[failover](/glossary#failover)".

<DiscoverableDisclosure label="Explore more" prompt="">
After a **failover**, the replica takes on the active role until the incident is resolved.
After, the replica **fails back** and the original Namespace resumes the active role.

In traditional active/active replication, multiple nodes serve requests and accept writes simultaneously, ensuring strong synchronous data consistency.
In contrast, with a Temporal Cloud high availability Namespace, only the active Namespace accepts requests and writes at any given time.
Workflow history events are written to the active Namespace first and then asynchronously replicated to the standby replica, ensuring that the replica remains in sync.

Each high availability Namespace replicates metadata and Workflow Executions to its connected replica.
This redundancy, combined with failover capability, provides measurable stability during outages.

## Achieving Business Continuity with 99.99% SLA

For many organizations, ensuring high availability is critical to maintaining business continuity.
Temporal Cloud's HA features provide a 99.99% contractual Service Level Agreement ([SLA](/cloud/sla)).

## Should you enable high availability features?

With HA features in Temporal Cloud, you can easily meet your availability SLAs, and ensure service disruptions and outages don’t affect the performance of your applications.

- Keep your applications online by protecting your Temporal Workflows against outages and service disruptions
- Replication and Multi-Region Replication offer a 99.99% contractual SLA for workloads with strict uptime requirements, compliance, and regulatory needs; whether you choose to be in a single region or across multiple regions.
