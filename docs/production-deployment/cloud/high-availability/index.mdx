<<<<<<< HEAD
Mission-critical deployment means applications must be reliably available even when an unexpected incident occurs.
Data loss and disruptions to Workflows can severely impact business.
Temporal's Namespace replication protects applications against outages and downtime by co-locating data in two isolation domains.
It synchronizes a fallback "replica"<ExpandableDefinition label="Definition" definition="A replica is a synchronized copy of your active Namespace. It provides a ready-to-deploy backup for unexpected outage conditions when your active Namespace becomes unavailable." /> that can take over Namespace duties during service incidents.
This keeps your Workflows running and your data available, even when your usual Namespace is unavailable.
Replication provides "Reliability-as-a-Service" at Temporal's higest level of availability guarantees.

## Replication and failovers

Temporal Cloud’s replicated Namespaces provide disaster-tolerant availability for critical workloads.
When you [enable replication](/cloud/replication/enable), Temporal Cloud syncs your data and Workflows between an active and a replica Namespace.
If an incident occurs, Temporal automatically **fails over**<ExpandableDefinition label="Definition" definition="A failover shifts Workflow Execution processing from an active Temporal Namespace to a standby Temporal Namespace replica during outages or other incidents. Temporal Cloud uses replication to duplicate data to the replica Namespace and prevent data loss during failover." /> your Namespace.

During a failover, your Workflow Executions and Schedules seamlessly transition from the active Namespace to a standby domain.
This standby domain is called a **replica**, as it replicates the Workflows and data of the active Namespace.
Once the incident resolves, the Namespaces reconcile and control returns back to the original.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/cloud/replication/failover.png"
    alt="Data and Workflows replicate to the Replica. Failover transfers control to the Replica that becomes the active Namespace. After resolution, control fails back to the original"
    style={{ width: '50%', border: '1px solid #ddd', borderRadius: '4px', margin: '20px' }}
  />
</div>

A high availability Namespace creates a single logical Namespace that operates across two domains: one active and one standby.
Replicated Namespaces combine access for both domains to a unified Namespace endpoint.
As Workflows progress in the active Namespace, Temporal Cloud replicates History events to the standby domain, ensuring continuity and data integrity.

During an incident or outage in the active domain, Temporal Cloud seamlessly fails over to your replica.
Failovers allow existing Workflow Executions to continue running and new Workflow Executions to be started.
Once failover occurs, the replica becomes active.
After the issue is resolved, the active replica "fails back" and the original Namespace resumes being "active".
Temporal resumes replication from the original active Namespace to the replica.

An **isolation domain** is a physically isolated data center within a deployment region for a given cloud provider.
**Regions** consist of multiple isolation domains.
Isolation domains provide redundancy and fault tolerance.

A **replicated Namespace** consists of an **active Namespace** and a passive, fallback **replica**.
Depending on your setup, your replica may reside in the same region as your active Namespace (standard replication), or it may be located in an entirely different region (multi-region replication).

After a **failover**, the replica takes on the active role until the incident is resolved.
After, the replica **fails back** and the original Namespace resumes the active role.

In traditional active/active replication, multiple nodes serve requests and accept writes simultaneously, ensuring strong synchronous data consistency.
In contrast, with a Temporal Cloud replicated Namespace, only the active Namespace accepts requests and writes at any given time.
Workflow history events are written to the active Namespace first and then asynchronously replicated to the standby replica, ensuring that the replica remains in sync.

Each high availability Namespace replicates its metadata and Workflow Executions to its connected replica.
This redundancy, combined with failover capability, provides measurable stability during outages.

A high availability Namespace is typically active in a single isolation domain at any given time, with the passive replica in a standby role.
The only exception occurs in the event of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_partition">network partition</a>.
In this situation, you can promote a standby isolation domain to active status.

**Caution:** This action will temporarily make both regions active.
Once the network partition is resolved and communication between the isolation domains/regions is restored, a conflict resolution algorithm determines which region remains active.
This ensures only one Namespace remains active.

</details>

**Temporal Cloud’s high availability features:**

- No manual deployment or configuration needed, just simple push-button operations.
- Existing Workflows resume seamlessly in the replica with minimal interruption and data loss.
- No changes needed for Worker and Workflow code during setup or failover.
- 99.99% contractual [SLA](/cloud/sla).

## Types of high availability

Temporal currently offers the following high availability features.
Configure these from your Namespace:

- **Replication**:
  Workflows are seamlessly replicated to a different isolation domain within the same region as the Namespace, such as "us-east-1".<ExpandableDefinition label="Info" definition="The us-east-1 region was Amazon's original and largest region. Many people consider it the 'default' region." />
  Choose this option for applications architected for a single-region.
  Your Namespaces failover to an isolation domain within the same region.
- **Multi-region replication**:
  Workflows are seamlessly replicated to a different region that you choose.
  Choose this option when your business requires multi-regional availability and the higher-level of resilience that separated locations offers.
  You will failover from one region to a separate region.

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

High-availability Namespaces are in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for Temporal Cloud.

Temporal Cloud's high-availability Namespaces provide disaster-tolerant deployment for workloads where availability is critical to your operations.
When you enable high availability, Temporal Cloud automatically synchronizes your data between a primary and a fallback Namespace, keeping them in sync.
Should an incident occur, Temporal will [failover](/glossary#failover) your Namespace.
This allows your Workflow Executions and Schedules to seamlessly shift from the active availability zone to the replica in the fallback availability zone.

## Availability zones and replicas

An availability zone is a physically isolated data center within a deployment region for a given cloud provider.
Regions consist of multiple availability zones, providing redundancy and fault tolerance.
In some cases, the fallback zone may be in the same region as the primary zone, or it may be in a different region altogether, depending on your deployment configuration.

High-availability simplifies deployment, ensuring operational continuity and data integrity even during unexpected events.
Regional disruptions or other issues that affect the data centers within a specific availability zone may occur.
High-availability allows processing to shift from the affected zone to an already-synchronized fallback zone.

This synchronized zone is called a "**replica**."
The process of duplicating all Workflow data ensures that your replica, which serves as the standby region, is always available and ready to take on the active role.

In the event of network service or performance issues in the active zone, your replica is ready to take over.
When necessary, Temporal Cloud smoothly transitions control from the active to the standby zone using a process called "[failover](/glossary#failover)".

## Should you choose high availability?
=======
For many organizations, ensuring high-availability is critical to maintaining business continuity.
Temporal Cloud's high-availability Namespace feature includes a 99.99% contractual Service Level Agreement ([SLA](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla)).
It provides 99.99% availability and 99.99% guarantee against service errors.

A high-availability Namespace (HAN) creates a single logical Namespace that operates across two physical zones: one active and one standby.
HANs streamline access for both zones to a unified Namespace endpoint.
As Workflows progress in the active zone, history events are asynchronously replicated to the standby zone, ensuring continuity and data integrity.

In the event of an incident or outage in the active zone, Temporal Cloud will seamlessly failover to your standby zone.
Failovers allow existing Workflow Executions to continue running and new Workflow Executions to be started.
Once failover occurs, the roles of the active and standby zones switch.
The standby zone becomes active, and the previous active zone becomes the standby.
After the issue is resolved, the zone "fails back" from the replica to the original.

Temporal currently offers the following high-availability options, which you select when upgrading your Namespace to use high-availability:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **High availability Namespaces** offer a 99.99% Service Level Agreement ([SLA](/cloud/sla)) for workloads with strict high availability needs.
  They use two Namespaces in two isolation domains to support standby recovery.
  In the event of an incident, Temporal Cloud automatically fails over the Namespace to the standby replica.
  High availability Namespaces' 99.99% availability is enforced by Temporal Cloud's [service error rates SLA](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla).
- **Namespaces without high availability** include a 99.9% contractual Service Level Agreement ([SLA](/cloud/sla)).
  In this use, Temporal clients connect to a single Namespace in one deployment domain.
  For many applications, this offers sufficient availability.

Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% service availability for all Namespaces, both single-region and high availability.
Our system is designed to limit data loss after recovery when the incident triggering the failover is resolved.

- Our recovery point objective (RPO)<ExpandableDefinition label="Definition" definition="RPO is the maximum acceptable duration during which transactional data might be lost from the service." /> is near-zero.
  There may be a short period of time during an incident or forced failover when some data is unavailable in the replica.
  Some Workflow History data won't arrive until networks issue are fixed, enabling the History to finish replicating and the divergent History branches to reconcile.
- Temporal Cloud proactively responds to incidents by triggering failovers.
  Our recovery time objective (RTO)<ExpandableDefinition label="Definition" definition="RTO sets a maximum time and service level objective, after which, service must be restored following a disruption." /> is 20 minutes or less per incident.

:::info

During a disaster scenario in which the data on the hard drives in the active Namespace cannot be recovered, the duration of data loss may be as high as the [replication lag](/cloud/replication/best-practices#metrics) at the time of disaster.

:::

=======
- **In-region replication** -
  Data is replicated to a separate zone in the same availability region, such as "us-east-1".
  This option offers near-instantaneous failovers but does not protect against regional disasters like hurricanes where both the primary and the fallback .
- **Multi-region replication** -
  Data is replicated to a separate region on the same continent.
  This option offers the greatest protection against weather events and other possible external causes for regional outages, as the regions are physically separated by large distances.
  Failover may experience some minor latency.

<div style={{backgroundColor: '#ffff00',padding: '0px 15px',borderRadius: '5px',border: '1px solid #cccccc',display: 'inline-block'}}>**Would be very nice to have more compelling explanations here**</div>

:::tip

As Namespace pairing is currently limited to regions within the same continent, South America is excluded as only one region is available.

## Should you choose high-availability?

Should you be using high-availability Namespaces? It depends on your availability requirements:

- High-availability Namespaces offer a 99.99% contractual SLA for workloads with strict high-availability needs.
  HANs use two Namespaces in two deployment zones to support standby recovery.
  In the event of a zone failure, Temporal Cloud automatically fails over the HAN Namespace to the standby replica.
- Single-zone Namespaces include a 99.9% contractual Service Level Agreement ([SLA](/cloud/sla)).
  In single-zone use, Temporal clients connect to a single Namespace in one deployment zone.
  For many applications, this offers sufficient availability.

Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% service availability for all Namespaces, both single-region and high-availability.

## Summary

The following list reviews the advantages of high-availability Namespaces:

- No manual deployment or configuration required—just simple push-button operation.
- Open Workflows continue in the standby zone with minimal interruption and data loss.
- No changes needed for Worker or Workflow code during setup or failover.
- 99.99% contractual SLA.
