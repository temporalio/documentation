Temporal Cloud provides high availability features for workloads where availability is critical to your operations.
When you enable these features, Temporal Cloud automatically synchronizes your data between the primary and a <span class="nowrap">replica<ExpandableDefinition label="Definition" definition="A replica is a synchronized copy of your active Namespace. It provides a ready-to-deploy backup for unexpected outage conditions when your active Namespace becomes unavailable." /></span>, keeping them in sync.
In case of an incident or an outage, Temporal will [failover](/glossary#failover) your Namespace from the primary to the replica.
This allows for Workflow Executions to seamlessly continue to make progress with minimal interruptions or data loss.

## Replication and Replicas

High availability (HA) features in Temporal Cloud simplify deployment, ensuring operational continuity and data integrity even during unexpected events impacting an availability zone (AZ) or a region using a process called Replication.
Replication asynchronously replicates Workflow Executions from an active region to its replica.
Using Temporal Cloud’s HA features, you can create a replica in the same region or in a different region.
In the event of network service or performance issues in the active region, your replica is ready to take over.
Temporal Cloud smoothly transitions control from the active to the replica via a "[failover](/glossary#failover)".

## Achieving Business Continuity with 99.99% SLA

For many organizations, ensuring high-availability is critical to maintaining business continuity.
Temporal Cloud's HA features provide a 99.99% contractual Service Level Agreement ([SLA](/cloud/sla)).

## Should you enable high availability features?

With HA features in Temporal Cloud, you can easily meet your availability SLAs, and ensure service disruptions and outages don’t affect the performance of your applications.

- Keep your applications online by protecting your Temporal Workflows against outages and service disruptions
- Replication and Multi-Region Replication offer a 99.99% contractual SLA for workloads with strict uptime requirements, compliance, and regulatory needs; whether you choose to be in a single region or across multiple regions.
