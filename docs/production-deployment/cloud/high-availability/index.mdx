:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

High-availability Namespaces are in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for Temporal Cloud.

Discuss. "Replica" is the corpus of Workflows. High Availability is a _capability_. Features are "replication" and "multi-region". Features achieve HA workflows in your applications. See messaging guide.**</div>

Temporal Cloud's high-availability Namespaces provide disaster-tolerant deployment for workloads where availability is critical to your operations.
When you enable high availability, Temporal Cloud automatically synchronizes your data between a primary and a fallback Namespace, keeping them in sync.
Should an incident occur, Temporal will [failover](/glossary#failover) your Namespace.
This allows your Workflow Executions and Schedules to seamlessly shift from the active availability zone to the replica in the fallback availability zone.

## Availability zones and replicas

An availability zone is a physically isolated data center within a deployment region for a given cloud provider.
Regions consist of multiple availability zones, providing redundancy and fault tolerance.
In some cases, the fallback zone may be in the same region as the primary zone, or it may be in a different region altogether, depending on your deployment configuration.

High-availability simplifies deployment, ensuring operational continuity and data integrity even during unexpected events.
Regional disruptions or other issues that affect the data centers within a specific availability zone may occur.
High-availability allows processing to shift from the affected zone to an already-synchronized fallback zone.

This synchronized zone is called a "**replica**."
The process of duplicating all Workflow data ensures that your replica, which serves as the standby region, is always available and ready to take on the active role.

In the event of network service or performance issues in the active zone, your replica is ready to take over.
When necessary, Temporal Cloud smoothly transitions control from the active to the standby zone using a process called "[failover](/glossary#failover)".

## High-availability and business continuity {#high-availability-intro}

For many organizations, ensuring high-availability is critical to maintaining business continuity.
Temporal Cloud's high-availability Namespace feature includes a 99.99% contractual Service Level Agreement ([SLA](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla)).
It provides 99.99% availability and 99.99% guarantee against service errors.

A high-availability Namespace (HAN) creates a single logical Namespace that operates across two physical zones: one active and one standby.
HANs streamline access for both zones to a unified Namespace endpoint.
As Workflows progress in the active zone, history events are asynchronously replicated to the standby zone, ensuring continuity and data integrity.

In the event of an incident or outage in the active zone, Temporal Cloud will seamlessly failover to your standby zone.
Failovers allow existing Workflow Executions to continue running and new Workflow Executions to be started.
Once failover occurs, the roles of the active and standby zones switch.
The standby zone becomes active, and the previous active zone becomes the standby.
After the issue is resolved, the zone "fails back" from the replica to the original.

## Types of high-availability

Temporal currently offers the following high-availability options, which you select when upgrading your Namespace to use high-availability:

- **In-region replication** -
  Data is replicated to a separate zone in the same availability region, such as "us-east-1".
  This option offers near-instantaneous failovers but does not protect against regional disasters like hurricanes where both the primary and the fallback .
- **Multi-region replication** -
  Data is replicated to a separate region on the same continent.
  This option offers the greatest protection against weather events and other possible external causes for regional outages, as the regions are physically separated by large distances.
  Failover may experience some minor latency.

:::tip

As Namespace pairing is currently limited to regions within the same continent, South America is excluded as only one region is available.

## Should you choose high-availability?

Should you be using high-availability Namespaces? It depends on your availability requirements:

- High-availability Namespaces offer a 99.99% contractual SLA for workloads with strict high-availability needs.
  HANs use two Namespaces in two deployment zones to support standby recovery.
  In the event of a zone failure, Temporal Cloud automatically fails over the HAN Namespace to the standby replica.
- Single-zone Namespaces include a 99.9% contractual Service Level Agreement ([SLA](/cloud/sla)).
  In single-zone use, Temporal clients connect to a single Namespace in one deployment zone.
  For many applications, this offers sufficient availability.

Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% service availability for all Namespaces, both single-region and high-availability.

## Summary

The following list reviews the advantages of high-availability Namespaces:

- No manual deployment or configuration requiredâ€”just simple push-button operation.
- Open Workflows continue in the standby zone with minimal interruption and data loss.
- No changes needed for Worker or Workflow code during setup or failover.
- 99.99% contractual SLA.
