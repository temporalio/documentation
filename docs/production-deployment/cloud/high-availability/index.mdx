Mission-critical deployment means applications must be reliably available even when an unexpected incident occurs.
Data loss and disruptions to Workflows can severely impact business.
Temporal's Namespace replication protects applications against outages and downtime by co-locating data in two isolation domains.
It synchronizes a fallback "replica"<ExpandableDefinition label="Definition" definition="A replica is a synchronized copy of your active Namespace. It provides a ready-to-deploy backup for unexpected outage conditions when your active Namespace becomes unavailable." /> that can take over Namespace duties during service incidents.
This keeps your Workflows running and your data available, even when your usual Namespace is unavailable.
Replication provides "Reliability-as-a-Service" at Temporal's higest level of availability guarantees.

## Replication and failovers

Temporal Cloud’s replicated Namespaces provide disaster-tolerant availability for critical workloads.
When you [enable replication](/cloud/replication/enable), Temporal Cloud syncs your data and Workflows between an active and a replica Namespace.
If an incident occurs, Temporal automatically **fails over**<ExpandableDefinition label="Definition" definition="A failover shifts Workflow Execution processing from an active Temporal Namespace to a standby Temporal Namespace replica during outages or other incidents. Temporal Cloud uses replication to duplicate data to the replica Namespace and prevent data loss during failover." /> your Namespace.

During a failover, your Workflow Executions and Schedules seamlessly transition from the active Namespace to a standby domain.
This standby domain is called a **replica**, as it replicates the Workflows and data of the active Namespace.
Once the incident resolves, the Namespaces reconcile and control returns back to the original.

    style={{ width: '50%', border: '1px solid #ddd', borderRadius: '4px', margin: '20px' }}
  />
</div>

A high availability Namespace creates a single logical Namespace that operates across two domains: one active and one standby.
Replicated Namespaces combine access for both domains to a unified Namespace endpoint.
As Workflows progress in the active Namespace, Temporal Cloud replicates History events to the standby domain, ensuring continuity and data integrity.

During an incident or outage in the active domain, Temporal Cloud seamlessly fails over to your replica.
Failovers allow existing Workflow Executions to continue running and new Workflow Executions to be started.
Once failover occurs, the replica becomes active.
After the issue is resolved, the active replica "fails back" and the original Namespace resumes being "active".
Temporal resumes replication from the original active Namespace to the replica.

An **isolation domain** is a physically isolated data center within a deployment region for a given cloud provider.
**Regions** consist of multiple isolation domains.
Isolation domains provide redundancy and fault tolerance.

A **replicated Namespace** consists of an **active Namespace** and a passive, fallback **replica**.
Depending on your setup, your replica may reside in the same region as your active Namespace (standard replication), or it may be located in an entirely different region (multi-region replication).

After a **failover**, the replica takes on the active role until the incident is resolved.
After, the replica **fails back** and the original Namespace resumes the active role.

In traditional active/active replication, multiple nodes serve requests and accept writes simultaneously, ensuring strong synchronous data consistency.
In contrast, with a Temporal Cloud replicated Namespace, only the active Namespace accepts requests and writes at any given time.
Workflow history events are written to the active Namespace first and then asynchronously replicated to the standby replica, ensuring that the replica remains in sync.

Each high availability Namespace replicates its metadata and Workflow Executions to its connected replica.
This redundancy, combined with failover capability, provides measurable stability during outages.

A high availability Namespace is typically active in a single isolation domain at any given time, with the passive replica in a standby role.
The only exception occurs in the event of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_partition">network partition</a>.
In this situation, you can promote a standby isolation domain to active status.

**Caution:** This action will temporarily make both regions active.
Once the network partition is resolved and communication between the isolation domains/regions is restored, a conflict resolution algorithm determines which region remains active.
This ensures only one Namespace remains active.

**Temporal Cloud’s high availability features:**

- No manual deployment or configuration needed, just simple push-button operations.
- Existing Workflows resume seamlessly in the replica with minimal interruption and data loss.
- No changes needed for Worker and Workflow code during setup or failover.
- 99.99% contractual [SLA](/cloud/sla).

## Types of high availability

Temporal currently offers the following high availability features.
Configure these from your Namespace:

- **Replication**:
  Workflows are seamlessly replicated to a different isolation domain within the same region as the Namespace, such as "us-east-1".<ExpandableDefinition label="Info" definition="The us-east-1 region was Amazon's original and largest region. Many people consider it the 'default' region." />
  Choose this option for applications architected for a single-region.
  Your Namespaces failover to an isolation domain within the same region.
- **Multi-region replication**:
  Workflows are seamlessly replicated to a different region that you choose.
  Choose this option when your business requires multi-regional availability and the higher-level of resilience that separated locations offers.
  You will failover from one region to a separate region.

:::note

Replication charges apply when you enable high availability.

## Should you choose high availability?

Should you be using high availability Namespaces? It depends on your availability requirements:

- **High availability Namespaces** offer a 99.99% Service Level Agreement ([SLA](/cloud/sla)) for workloads with strict high availability needs.
  They use two Namespaces in two isolation domains to support standby recovery.
  In the event of an incident, Temporal Cloud automatically fails over the Namespace to the standby replica.
  High availability Namespaces' 99.99% availability is enforced by Temporal Cloud's [service error rates SLA](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla).
- **Namespaces without high availability** include a 99.9% contractual Service Level Agreement ([SLA](/cloud/sla)).
  In this use, Temporal clients connect to a single Namespace in one deployment domain.
  For many applications, this offers sufficient availability.

Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% service availability for all Namespaces, both single-region and high availability.
Our system is designed to limit data loss after recovery when the incident triggering the failover is resolved.

- Our recovery point objective (RPO)<ExpandableDefinition label="Definition" definition="RPO is the maximum acceptable duration during which transactional data might be lost from the service." /> is near-zero.
  There may be a short period of time during an incident or forced failover when some data is unavailable in the replica.
  Some Workflow History data won't arrive until networks issue are fixed, enabling the History to finish replicating and the divergent History branches to reconcile.
- Temporal Cloud proactively responds to incidents by triggering failovers.
  Our recovery time objective (RTO)<ExpandableDefinition label="Definition" definition="RTO sets a maximum time and service level objective, after which, service must be restored following a disruption." /> is 20 minutes or less per incident.

:::info

During a disaster scenario in which the data on the hard drives in the active Namespace cannot be recovered, the duration of data loss may be as high as the [replication lag](/cloud/replication/best-practices#metrics) at the time of disaster.
