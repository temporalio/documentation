Temporal Cloud is designed with reliability and availability built into its foundations.
Temporal Cloud provides a 99.9% contractual Service Level Agreement ([SLA](/cloud/sla)) guarantee against service errors for all Namespaces.
This ensures that most use cases are supported with our base product.

<DiscoverableDisclosure label="Namespaces and built-in stability">

Each standard Temporal Namespace uses replication across three availability zones to ensure high availability.
An availability zone is a part of the system where tasks or operations are handled and executed.
This design helps manage workloads and ensure tasks are completed.
This improves resource use and reduces delays.

Replication makes sure that any changes to Workflow state or History are saved in all three zones _before_ the Temporal Service acknowledges a change back to the Client.
As a result, your standard Temporal Namespace stays operational even if one of its three zones becomes unavailable.
This provides the basis of our 99.9% service level.

## High Availability features {#high-availability-features}

**Business continuity with 99.99% SLA**

For many organizations, ensuring high availability is critical to maintaining business continuity.
For these critical use cases, Temporal Cloud offers a suite of _High Availability features_ with a 99.99% contractual SLA.
This provides a higher service level than our standard 99.9% SLA.
With High Availability features in Temporal Cloud, you can meet your availability SLAs, and ensure service disruptions and outages don’t affect the performance of your applications.

- Keep your applications online by protecting your Temporal Workflows against outages and service disruptions
- Same-region Replication and Multi-region Replication offer a 99.99% contractual SLA for workloads with strict uptime requirements, compliance, and regulatory needs; whether you choose to be in a single region or across multiple regions.

### Critical availability

Temporal Cloud provides Namespaces with High Availability features for workloads where availability is critical to your operations.
When you enable these features, Temporal Cloud automatically synchronizes your data between the primary and a <ToolTipTerm term="replica"/>, keeping them in sync.
In case of an incident or an outage, Temporal will automatically <ToolTipTerm term="fail over" src="failover" /> your Namespace from the primary to the replica.
This lets Workflow Executions continue with minimal interruptions or data loss.
Customers can also initiate failovers based on their situational monitoring or for testing.

<CaptionedImage src="/img/cloud/high-availability/failover.png" title="On failover, the replica becomes active and the Namespace endpoint directs access to it." />

Returning control from the replica to the primary is called a <ToolTipTerm term="failback" />.
The replica is active for a brief duration during an incident.
After the incident, Temporal fails back to the primary.

### Replication and replicas {#replications-and-replicas}

Temporal Cloud's High Availability features simplify deployment, ensuring operational continuity and data integrity even during unexpected events impacting an isolation domain or a region using a process called Replication.
Replication asynchronously copies Workflow Executions and metadata from a primary to its replica.
This redundancy, combined with failover capability, provides measurable stability during outages.

Using Temporal Cloud’s High Availability features, you can create a replica in the same region or in a different region.
In the event of network service or performance issues in the primary, your replica is ready to take over.
Temporal Cloud smoothly transitions control from the active primary to the replica via a failover.

After a failover, the replica takes on the active role as the primary until the incident is resolved.
After, the replica fails back and the original Namespace resumes the active role and becomes the primary.

In traditional active/active replication, multiple nodes serve requests and accept writes simultaneously, ensuring strong synchronous data consistency.
In contrast, with a Temporal Cloud Namespace that has a replica, only the primary accepts requests and writes at any given time.
Workflow history events are written to the primary first and then asynchronously replicated to the replica, ensuring that the replica remains in sync.

## SLA for High Availability features {#sla}

**What guarantees does Temporal offer for replication features?**

Namespace replication offers 99.99% availability, enforced by Temporal Cloud's [service error rates SLA](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla).
Our system is designed to limit data loss after recovery when the incident triggering the failover is resolved.

Our recovery point objective (<ToolTipTerm term="RPO" />) is near-zero.
There may be a short period of time during an incident or forced failover when some data is unavailable in the replica region.
Some Workflow History data won't arrive until network issues are fixed, enabling the History to finish replicating and the divergent History branches to reconcile.

Temporal Cloud proactively responds to incidents by triggering failovers.
Our recovery time objective (<ToolTipTerm term="RTO" />) is 20 minutes or less per incident.

:::info

During a disaster scenario in which the data in the primary Namespace cannot be recovered, the duration of data loss may be as high as the [replication lag](/cloud/high-availability/monitor) at the time of disaster.

### Regional availability {#regional-availability}

Multi-region Namespaces are available in all existing [Temporal Cloud regions](/cloud/regions).
Same-region Namespaces are available in select AWS regions.
If the region you require is not supported, contact [Support](https://support.temporal.io) to request more regions.

:::tip

Namespace pairing is currently limited to regions within the same continent.
South America is excluded as only one region is available.
