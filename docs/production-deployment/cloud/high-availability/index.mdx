Temporal Cloud's High Availability features use asynchronous <ToolTipTerm term="replication"/> across multiple <ToolTipTerm term="isolation domains" /> to provide enhanced resilience and a 99.99% [SLA](/cloud/sla).
When you enable High Availability features, Temporal deploys your primary and its <ToolTipTerm term="replica"/> in separate isolation domains, giving you control over the location of both. This redundancy, combined with <ToolTipTerm term="failover"/> capability, enhances availability during outages.

## Built-in reliability

Even without High Availability features, Temporal Cloud provides robust reliability and a 99.9% contractual Service Level Agreement ([SLA](/cloud/sla)) guarantee against service errors.

Each standard Temporal Namespace uses replication across three availability zones to ensure high availability.
An availability zone is a part of the system where tasks or operations are handled and executed.
This design helps manage workloads and ensure tasks are completed while improving resource use and reducing delays.

Replication makes sure that any changes to Workflow state or History are saved in all three zones _before_ the Temporal Service acknowledges a change back to the Client.
As a result, your standard Temporal Namespace stays operational even if one of its three zones becomes unavailable.
This provides the basis of our 99.9% service level.

## High Availability features {#high-availability-features}

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

Same-region Replication and Multi-cloud Replication are in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview).

Multi-region Replication is in [General Availability](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#general-availability)

:::

High Availability features provide three types of replication:

| **Deployment**                          | **Description**                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Same&#8209;region&nbsp;Replication**  | Isolation domains are located within the same region.   |
| **Multi&#8209;region&nbsp;Replication** | Isolation domains are located in separate regions.         |
| **Multi&#8209;cloud&nbsp;Replication**  | Isolation domains are located in separate cloud providers. |

### Same-region Replication

Temporal replicates Namespaces across isolation domains within one region.
This option is a good fit when your application is built for one region and you prefer to failover within that region.
This provides a reliable failover mechanism while maintaining deployment simplicity.

### Multi-region Replication

Temporal replicates Namespaces across regions, making sure Workflows and data are available even if a region fails.
Asynchronous replication means changes arenâ€™t immediately reflected in other regions but will sync over time, ensuring data integrity.
This setup allows failovers between replicas without needing immediate consistency across regions.
Replication across different regions enhances resilience and reliability.

### Multi-cloud Replication

Temporal asynchronously replicates all Workflows (live and historical) and data to a Namespace in an entirely different cloud provider.
If a provider outage, regional outage, service disruption, or network issue occurs, traffic automatically shifts to the replica.
Replicated data is securely encrypted and transmitted across the public internet between cloud providers.
Internet connectivity allows workers in one cloud to fail over to a replica in a different cloud.

:::info

When you adopt Temporal's High Availability features, don't forget to consider the reliability of your own workers, infrastructure, and dependencies.
Issues like network outages, hardware failures, or misconfigurations in your own systems can affect your application performance.

For the highest level of reliability, distribute your dependencies across regions, and use our Multi-region or Multi-cloud replication features.
Using physically separated regions improves the fault tolerance of your application.

## Service levels and recovery objectives

Namespaces using High Availability have a 99.99% [uptime SLA](/cloud/sla) with sub-1-minute [RPO](/cloud/rpo-rto) and 20-minute [RTO](/cloud/rpo-rto). For detailed information:

- [Service Level Agreement (SLA)](/cloud/sla)
- [Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO)](/cloud/rpo-rto)

## Failover

High Availability Namespaces can automatically or manually [fail over](/cloud/high-availability/failovers) to the replica if the primary is unavailable or unhealthy.

## Target workloads

High Availability Namespaces are a great solution for Workloads where an outage would cause:

- Revenue loss
- Poor customer experience
- Problems stemming from policy/legal requirements that demand high availability

These are often major concerns for financial services, e-commerce, gaming, global SaaS platforms, bookings & reservations, delivery & shipping, and order management.
