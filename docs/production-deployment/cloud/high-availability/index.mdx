Temporal Cloud is designed with reliability and availability built into its foundations.
Temporal Cloud provides a 99.9% contractual Service Level Agreement ([SLA](/cloud/sla)) guarantee against service errors for all Namespaces.
This ensures that most use cases are supported with our base product.


<DiscoverableDisclosure label="Namespaces and built-in stability">

Each standard Temporal Namespace uses replication across three availability zones to ensure high availability.
An availability zone is a part of the system where tasks or operations are handled and executed.
This design helps manage workloads and ensure tasks are completed.
This improves resource use and reduces delays.

Replication makes sure that any changes to Workflow state or History are saved in all three zones _before_ the Temporal Service acknowledges a change back to the Client.
As a result, your standard Temporal Namespace stays operational even if one of its three zones becomes unavailable.
This provides the basis of our 99.9% service level.

## Business Continuity with 99.99% SLA

For many organizations, ensuring high availability is critical to maintaining business continuity.
For these critical use cases, Temporal Cloud offers a suite of _High Availability features_ with a 99.99% contractual SLA.
With High Availability features in Temporal Cloud, you can easily meet your availability SLAs, and ensure service disruptions and outages don’t affect the performance of your applications.

- Keep your applications online by protecting your Temporal Workflows against outages and service disruptions
- Same-region replication and multi-region replication offer a 99.99% contractual SLA for workloads with strict uptime requirements, compliance, and regulatory needs; whether you choose to be in a single region or across multiple regions.

## High Availability features {#high-availability-features}

Temporal Cloud provides Namespaces with High Availability features for workloads where availability is critical to your operations.
When you enable these features, Temporal Cloud automatically synchronizes your data between the primary and a <ToolTipTerm term="replica" tooltip="A replica is a synchronized copy of a Namespace. It ensures redundancy, fault tolerance, and minimal downtime during an incident or outage. A replica can take over operations if the primary becomes unavailable. It's synchronized up to the point of replication lag, where no further data is available." />, keeping them in sync.
In case of an incident or an outage, Temporal will automatically <ToolTipTerm term="failover" tooltip="A failover shifts Workflow Execution processing from a primary  Namespace to a replica during outages or other incidents. Temporal Cloud uses replication to duplicate data and prevent data loss during failover." /> your Namespace from the primary to the replica.
This lets Workflow Executions continue with minimal interruptions or data loss.
Customers can also initiate failovers based on their situational monitoring or for testing.

<CaptionedImage src="/img/cloud/high-availability/failover.png" title="On failover, the replica becomes active and the Namespace endpoint directs access to  it" />

Returning control from the replica to the primary is called a <ToolTipTerm term="failback" tooltip="A failback returns Workflow Execution processing to the primary from the replica after an incident resolves. This is automatic for Temporal-initiated failovers but can be disabled in region settings." />.
The replica is active for a brief duration during an incident.
After the incident, Temporal fails back to the primary.

## Replication and replicas {#replications-and-replicas}

Temporal Cloud's High Availability features simplify deployment, ensuring operational continuity and data integrity even during unexpected events impacting an isolation domain or a region using a process called Replication.
Replication asynchronously copies Workflow Executions and metadata from a primary to its replica.
This redundancy, combined with failover capability, provides measurable stability during outages.

Using Temporal Cloud’s High Availability features, you can create a replica in the same region or in a different region.
In the event of network service or performance issues in the primary, your replica is ready to take over.
Temporal Cloud smoothly transitions control from the active to the replica via a failover".

After a failover, the replica takes on the active role until the incident is resolved.
After, the replica fails back and the original Namespace resumes the active role.
(Failback may be disabled by demand in your Namespace settings.)

In traditional active/active replication, multiple nodes serve requests and accept writes simultaneously, ensuring strong synchronous data consistency.
In contrast, with a Temporal Cloud Namespace that has a replica, only the primary accepts requests and writes at any given time.
Workflow history events are written to the primary first and then asynchronously replicated to the replica, ensuring that the replica remains in sync.
