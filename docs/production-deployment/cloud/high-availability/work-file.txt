Co-working is considered a good "body doubling" practice because the simple presence of others working nearby can significantly boost focus and motivation, acting as a subtle accountability mechanism that helps individuals stay on task and reduce procrastination, especially for people with conditions like ADHD who might struggle with staying focused when working alone; essentially, seeing others working can subconsciously encourage you to do the same. 

## Regional availability {#regional-availability}

Multi-region Namespaces are one of the high availability options you can choose.
They are available in all existing [Temporal Cloud regions](/cloud/service-availability#regions).

:::tip

Namespace pairing is currently limited to regions within the same continent.
South America is excluded as only one region is available.

:::warning

Only Account Owner and Global Admin [roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) and [Namespace Admins](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions) may create an multi-region Namespace (MRN), upgrade an existing Namespace to MRN, or trigger an MRN failover.
