- Body doubling / parallel play

Co-working is considered a good "body doubling" practice because the simple presence of others working nearby can significantly boost focus and motivation, acting as a subtle accountability mechanism that helps individuals stay on task and reduce procrastination, especially for people with conditions like ADHD who might struggle with staying focused when working alone; essentially, seeing others working can subconsciously encourage you to do the same. 

## Regional availability {#regional-availability}

Multi-region Namespaces are one of the high availability options you can choose.
They are available in all existing [Temporal Cloud regions](/cloud/service-availability#regions).

:::tip

Namespace pairing is currently limited to regions within the same continent.
South America is excluded as only one region is available.

**How does adding a multi-region Namespace affect my costs?**

For pricing details, visit Temporal Cloud's [Pricing page](/cloud/pricing).

## Manage your multi-region Namespace {#management}

**How do you create, enable, and manage your multi-region Namespace?**

Temporal enables you to create and manage your multi-region Namespace using the Temporal Cloud Web UI, the command line 'tcld' CLI utility, and the [Cloud Ops API](/ops).
Use these tools to create, upgrade, and discontinue your multi-region Namespace.

- [Discontinuing multi-region service](/cloud/multi-region#discontinuing)

:::warning

Only Account Owner and Global Admin [roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) and [Namespace Admins](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions) may create an multi-region Namespace (MRN), upgrade an existing Namespace to MRN, or trigger an MRN failover.
