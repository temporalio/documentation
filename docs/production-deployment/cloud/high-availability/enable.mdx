You can enable high availability (HA) features for a new or existing Namespace by adding a replica.
When you add a replica, Temporal Cloud begins the replication of ongoing and existing workflows.
Once the replication is complete and the replica is ready, your Namespace is ready for failover.

Advantages of using Temporal Cloud’s HA features:

- No manual deployment or configuration needed, just simple push-button operations.
- Existing Workflows resume seamlessly in the replica with minimal interruption and data loss.
- No changes needed for Worker and Workflow code during setup or failover.
- 99.99% contractual SLA.

## High availability features

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

Single-region replication is in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for Temporal Cloud.

:::

Temporal currently offers the following HA features, which you can configure at a Namespace level.
See the “Enable high availability features” section for more details.

- Single-region replication: Workflows are seamlessly replicated to a different isolation domain within the same region as the Namespace, such as "us-east-1".
  This option is a good fit if your application is architected to be in a single-region and you would prefer to failover within the same region.
- Multi-region replication: Workflows are seamlessly replicated to a different region that you can choose.
  This option is a good fit if your application is architected to be multi-region and your business requires multi-regional availability.

There are charges associated with Replication and enabling high availability features.
For pricing details, visit Temporal Cloud's [Pricing](/cloud/pricing) page.

## Create a high availability Namespace {#create}

To create a new replicated Namespace, you can use the Temporal Cloud Web site or the `tcld` command line utility.
The following table explains how:

| Approach                  | Instructions                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Temporal&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;Web&nbsp;UI**  | 1. Visit Temporal Cloud in your Web browser. <br /> 2. During Namespace creation, specify the active region for the Namespace. <br /> 3. Select "Add a replica". <ul><li>Adding a replica in the same region enables Replication.</li><li>Adding a replica in a different region enables Multi-region Replication.</li></ul> |
| **Temporal&nbsp;`tcld`&nbsp;CLI**    | At the command line, enter: <br /> <tt>tcld namespace create \ <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--namespace \<namespace_id>.\<account_id> \ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--region \<active_region> \ <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--region \<replica_region></tt> <br /> <br /> Specify the [region codes](/cloud/service-availability) as arguments to the two `--region` flags. <ul> <li>Using the same region replicates to an isolation zone within that region.</li> <li>Using a different region within the same continent creates a multi-region Namespace.</li> </ul> Before pressing return, add your authentication credentials. For example, `--ca-certificate-file <path-to-pem-file>`. |

:::tip

Replication is not supported in all regions.
For multi-region replication, pairing is limited to regions within the same continent.

## Upgrade an existing Namespace to high availability functionality {#upgrade}

Upgrade an existing single-region Namespace to high availability features by establishing a replica.
The following table explains how:

| Approach                  | Instructions                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Temporal&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;Web&nbsp;UI**  | 1. Visit Temporal Cloud Namespaces in your Web browser. <br /> 2. Navigate to the Namespace details page. <br /> 3. Select the “Add a replica” button. <br /> 4. Choose either **Replication** (in the same region) or **Multi-region Replication** (across regions). <ul><li>If you select Multi-region Replication, specify which region.</li></ul> The web interface will present an estimated time for replication to complete. <br /> This time is based on your selection and the size and scale of the Workflows in your Namespace. <br /> An email alert is dispatched once your highly available Namespace is ready for use. |
| **Temporal&nbsp;`tcld`&nbsp;CLI**    | At the command line, enter: <br /> <tt>tcld namespace add-region \ <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--namespace \<namespace_id>.\<account_id> \ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--region \<replica_region></tt> <br /> <br /> Specify the added [region code](/cloud/service-availability) as an argument to the `--region` flag. <ul><li>Using the current region replicates to an isolation zone within your existing region.</li><li>Using a different region within the same continent creates a multi-region Namespace.</li></ul> <br /> Before pressing return, add your authentication credentials.<br />For example, `--ca-certificate-file <path-to-pem-file>`. <br /> An email alert is sent once your multi-region Namespace is ready for use. |

## Discontinue high availability replication {#discontinuing}

Removing a Namespace replica disables high availability and automatic failover features.
Follow these steps to disable these features and end high availability charges:

1. Navigate to the Namespace details page in Temporal Cloud.
2. On the "Region" card, select the option to "Remove Replica."

Temporal Cloud deletes the replica.
Your Namespace will no longer be highly available and you will no longer be charged for this feature.

:::note

After removing a replica, Temporal Cloud can't re-enable replication in the same region for a given Namespace for seven days.
