You enable High Availability features for a new or existing Namespace by adding a replica to the Namespace.
When you add a replica, Temporal Cloud begins replicating ongoing and existing Workflows.
Once the replication has completed and the replica is ready, your Namespace is ready for failover.

## Create a high availability Namespace {#create}

The following sections explain how to create a Namespace with a replica.
You can create a replica within the current region or deploy the replica to a different region.

::: note

While reading through this coverage, be aware that replication is not supported in all regions.
For multi-region replication, pairing is limited to regions within the same continent.
For more details, refer to ["Regional availability"].(/cloud/high-availabilityregional-availability).

:::

### Temporal Cloud Web UI

Follow these steps to add replication to your Temporal Cloud Namespace:

1. During Namespace creation, specify the first region for the Namespace.
2. Select the “Add a replica” option.
   Adding a replica in the same region enables Replication.
   Adding a replica in a second region enables Multi-region Replication.

### Temporal 'tcld' CLI

Enter the following at the command-line to create a replicated Namespace:

```sh
tcld namespace create \
   --namespace <namespace_id>.<account_id> \
   --region <region> \
   --region <region>
```

Specify the [region codes](/cloud/service-availability) as arguments to the two `--region` flags.

- Using the same region replicates to an isolation zone within that region.
- Using a different region within the same continent creates a multi-region Namespace.

Before pressing return, add your authentication credentials.
For example, `--ca-certificate-file <path-to-pem-file>`.

## Upgrade an existing Namespace to high availability functionality {#upgrade}

Upgrade an existing single-region Namespace to high availability features by establishing a replica.
The following sections explain how.
You can either create a replica within the current region or deploy the replica to a different region.

### Temporal Cloud Web UI

Follow these steps to upgrade an existing Namespace:

1. Visit Temporal Cloud Namespaces in your Web browser
1. Navigate to the Namespace details page
1. Select the “Add a replica” button.
1. Choose either **Replication** (in the same region) or **Multi-region Replication** (across regions).
   If you select Multi-region Replication, specify which region

The web interface will present an estimated time for replication to complete.
This time is based on your selection and the size and scale of the Workflows in your Namespace.
An email alert is dispatched once your highly available Namespace is ready for use.

### Temporal 'tcld' CLI

Enter the following at the command-line to upgrade a Namespace for replication:

```sh
tcld namespace add-region \
    --namespace <namespace_id>.<account_id> \
    --region <region>
```

Specify the added [region code](/cloud/service-availability) as an argument to the `--region` flag.

- Using the current region replicates to an isolation zone within your existing region.
- Using a different region within the same continent creates a multi-region Namespace.

Before pressing return, add your authentication credentials.
For example, `--ca-certificate-file <path-to-pem-file>`.

An email alert is sent once your multi-region Namespace is ready for use.

## Discontinuing high availability replicas {#discontinuing}

Removing a Namespace replica removes the high availability and automatic failover features that provide Temporal's highest service level agreement.
To disable these features and end charges:

1. Navigate to the Namespace details page in Temporal Cloud.
2. On the “Region” card, select the option to “Remove Replica”.

The replica will be deleted and your Namespace will no longer be highly available.
You will no longer be charged for this feature.

:::note

After removing a replica, Temporal Cloud can't re-enable replication in the same region for a given Namespace for seven days.
