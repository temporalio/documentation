import { ToolTipTerm } from '@site/src/components';

You can enable High Availability features for a new or existing Namespace by adding a replica.
When you add a replica, Temporal Cloud begins the replication of ongoing and existing Workflow Executions.
Once the replication is complete and the replica is ready, your Namespace is ready for failover.

Advantages of using Temporal Cloud’s High Availability features:

- No manual deployment or configuration needed, just simple push-button operations.
- Existing Workflows resume seamlessly in the replica with minimal interruption and data loss.
- No changes needed for Worker and Workflow code during setup or failover.
- 99.99% contractual SLA.

## High Availability features

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

Same-region Replication and Multi-cloud Replication are in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for Temporal Cloud.

:::

Temporal offers the following High Availability features, which you can configure at a Namespace level.

- **Same-region Replication**: Workflows are seamlessly replicated to a different <ToolTipTerm term="isolation domain" src="isolation domains" /> within the same region as the primary.
  This option is a good fit if your application is architected to be in one region and you would prefer to failover within the same region.
  It provides a reliable failover mechanism while maintaining deployment simplicity.
  GCP Namespaces do not support Same-region Replication.
- **Multi-region Replication**: Workflows are seamlessly replicated to a different [region](/cloud/high-availability/regions) that you choose.
  Replicating Workflows across different regions enhances resilience and reliability.
  This is particularly beneficial for organizations with multi-regional architectures or those required to be highly available across regions for compliance purposes.
  This option is a good fit if your application is architected to be multi-region.
  GCP Namespaces support Multi-region Replication.
- **Multi-cloud Replication**: Workflows are seamlessly replicated to a different cloud provider (AWS or GCP) that you choose.
  Replicating Workflows across different cloud providers offers reliability in the event of a widespread provider failure.
  This is particularly beneficial for organizations in highly regulated industries with requirements for multi-cloud availability.

There are charges associated with Replication and enabling High Availability features.
For pricing details, visit Temporal Cloud's [Pricing](/cloud/pricing) page.
This page explains how to enable and manage these features.

## Create a Namespace with High Availability features {#create}

To create a new Namespace with High Availability features, you can use the Temporal Cloud UI or the tcld command line utility.
The following instructions explain how:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="webui" label="Web UI">

    1. Visit Temporal Cloud in your Web browser.
    1. During Namespace creation, specify the primary [region](/cloud/high-availability/regions) for the Namespace.
    1. Select "Add a replica":
       - Adding a replica in the same region enables Same-region Replication.
       - Adding a replica in a different region (within the same continent) replicates across regions for Multi-region Replication.
       - Adding a replica on a different cloud provider replicates across providers for Multi-cloud Replication.
       - You cannot create a Multi-region deployment on separate continents.

    The web interface will present an estimated time for replication to complete.
    This time is based on your selection and the size and scale of the Workflows in your Namespace.

    Temporal Cloud sends an email alert once your Namespace is ready for use.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tcldcli" label="tcld">

At the command line, enter:

```
tcld namespace create \
   --namespace <namespace_id>.<account_id> \
   --region <primary_region> \
   --region <replica_region>
```

Specify the [region codes](/cloud/high-availability/regions) as arguments to the two `--region` flags.

- Using the same region replicates to an isolation domain within that region.
- Using a different region (within the same continent) replicates across regions.
- You cannot create a Multi-region deployment on separate continents.

If using API key authentication with the `--api-key` flag, you must add it directly after the tcld command and before `namespace create`.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::caution

Same-region Replication is not supported in all regions.
For Multi-region Replication, pairing is limited to regions within the same continent.
Contact [Support](https://support.temporal.io) to request more regions.

:::

## Upgrade an existing Namespace with High Availability functionality {#upgrade}

Upgrade an existing standard Namespace by adding High Availability features.
Adding a replica unlocks that functionality.

The following instructions explain how:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="webui" label="Web UI">

1. Visit Temporal Cloud Namespaces in your Web browser.
1. Navigate to the Namespace details page.
1. Select the “Add a replica” button.
1. Choose **Same-region Replication**, **Multi-region Replication** (across regions), or **Multi-cloud Repllication** (across cloud providers).<br />
   _If you select Multi-region Replication, specify which [region](/cloud/high-availability/regions).
   You cannot create a Multi-region deployment on separate continents._

The web interface will present an estimated time for replication to complete.
This time is based on your selection and the size and scale of the Workflows in your Namespace.

Temporal Cloud sends an email alert once your Namespace is ready for use.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tcldcli" label="tcld">

At the command line, enter:

```
tcld namespace add-region \
   --namespace <namespace_id>.<account_id> \
   --region <replica_region>
```

Specify the [region code](/cloud/high-availability/regions) of the region where you want to create the replica as an argument to the `--region` flag.

- Using the current region replicates to an isolation domain within your existing region.
- Using a different region (within the same continent) replicates across regions (Multi-region Replication).
- You cannot create a Multi-region deployment on separate continents.

If using API key authentication with the `--api-key` flag, you must add it directly after the tcld command and before `namespace add-region`.

Temporal Cloud sends an email alert once your Namespace is ready for use.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Change a replica location {#changing}

:::caution

We discourage changing the location of your replica for deployed applications, except under exceptional circumstances.
Changing the location of your Namespace replica will result in a mandatory 7-day waiting period before you can re-enable High Availability Namespace features.

:::

Temporal Cloud can't change replica locations directly.
To update the location, you need to remove the current replica and add a new one.
Follow these steps to change the replica location:

1. [Remove your replica](#discontinuing).
   This disables High Availability for your Namespace.
2. Wait through the required 7-day waiting period.
3. [Add a new replica](#upgrade) to your Namespace.

You will receive an email alert once your Namespace is ready for use.

## Discontinue High Availability features {#discontinuing}

Removing a Namespace replica disables High Availability and automatic failover features.
Follow these steps to disable these features and end High Availability charges:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="webui" label="Web UI">

1. Navigate to the Namespace details page in Temporal Cloud
1. Select the option to "Remove Replica" on the "Region" card.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tcldcli" label="tcld">

At the command line, enter:

```
tcld namespace delete-region \
    --namespace <namespace_id>.<account_id> \
    --region <replica_region>
```

If using API key authentication with the `--api-key` flag, you must add it directly after the tcld command and before `namespace delete-region`

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

After following these instructions, Temporal Cloud deletes the replica.
Your Namespace will no longer use High Availability features and you will no longer be charged for this feature.

:::note

After removing a replica, Temporal Cloud can't re-enable replication for a given Namespace for seven days.
