High-availability Namespaces are in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for Temporal Cloud.

How do you trigger failovers and observe Workflow Executions?
This section provides how-to instructions for the following operations tasks:

- [Health status of replica](#replica-health)
- [Metrics](#metrics)
  - [Monitoring and observability](#observe)
  - [Auditing operational events](#auditing)

## Replica health {#replica-health}

You can monitor your replica statuses with the Temporal Cloud UI.
If the replica is unhealthy, the “Trigger a failover” option is disabled to prevent failing over to an unhealthy replica.

An unhealthy replica might result from:

- **Data synchronization issues:** The replica fails to stay in sync with the **active Namespace** due to network or performance problems.
- **Replication lag:** The replica falls behind the **active Namespace**, causing it to be out of sync.
- **Network issues:** Loss of communication between the **replica** and the **active Namespace** causes problems.
- **Failed health checks:** If the replica fails health checks, it’s marked as unhealthy.

These issues prevent the replica from being used during a failover, ensuring system stability and consistency.

## Metrics {#metrics}

Replication lag refers to the transmission delay of Workflow updates and history events from the active region to the replica.
A forced failover when there is significant replication lag increases the likelihood of rolling back Workflow progress. Therefore, always check the replication lag metric before initiating a failover.

Temporal Cloud emits three replication lag-specific [metrics](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference#replication-lag).
The following samples demonstrate how you can use these metrics to monitor and explore replication lag:


**P99 replication lag histogram**:

```
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_bucket[$__rate_interval])) by (temporal_namespace, le))
```

**Average replication lag**:

```
sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_sum[$__rate_interval])) by (temporal_namespace)
/
sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_count[$__rate_interval])) by (temporal_namespace)
```

### Monitoring and observability {#observe}

You can view and alert for key cloud metrics using the Web UI, the 'tcld' CLI utility, or Temporal Cloud APIs.
For instance, when adding a region to a Namespace, you can track how Workflow replication progresses.
If any errors occur, they will be displayed in the Namespace Web UI.

:::tip

If a Namespace is using a replica, you may notice that the Action count in `temporal_cloud_v0_total_action_count` is doubled (2x).
This happens because operations are replicated: they occur on both the active Namespace and the replica.

:::

### Auditing operational events {#auditing}

Temporal Cloud offers several ways to audit events:

- When Temporal triggers failovers, the audit log will update with details.
  Look for `"operation": "FailoverNamespace"` in the logs.
- You can set up alerts for Temporal-initiated failover events.
- After a failover, verify that the Namespace is active in the new region using the Temporal Cloud Web UI.
