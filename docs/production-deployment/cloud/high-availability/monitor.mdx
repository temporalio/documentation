High-availability Namespaces are in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for Temporal Cloud.

How do you trigger failovers and observe Workflow Executions?
This section provides how-to instructions for the following operations tasks:

- [Health status of replica](#monitor-health)
- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [Monitoring and observability](#observe)

## Health status of replica {#monitor-health}

The status of the replica can be monitored using the Temporal Cloud UI.
When the replica is in an unhealthy state, you will see that the “Trigger a failover” option is disabled.
This is to prevent you from failing over your namespace to an unhealthy replica.

<div style={{backgroundColor: '#ffff00',padding: '0px 15px',borderRadius: '5px',border: '1px solid #cccccc',display: 'inline-block'}}>The replica could be in an unhealthy state because….</div>
<br /><br />
<div style={{backgroundColor: '#ffff00',padding: '0px 15px',borderRadius: '5px',border: '1px solid #cccccc',display: 'inline-block'}}>You can remediate by…</div>

## Metrics {#metrics}

Replication lag refers to the transmission delay of Workflow updates and history events from the active region to the replica.
A forced failover when there is a large replication lag has a higher likelihood of rolling back Workflow progress, so always check the metric replication lag before initiating a failover.
Temporal Cloud emits three replication lag-specific metrics.
The following samples demonstrate how you can use these metrics to explore replication lag.

**P99 replication lag histogram**:

```
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_bucket[$__rate_interval])) by (temporal_namespace, le))
```

**Average replication lag**:

```
sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_sum[$__rate_interval])) by (temporal_namespace)
/
sum(rate(temporal_cloud_v0_replication_lag_count[$__rate_interval])) by (temporal_namespace)
```

## Monitoring and observability {#observe}

You can view and alert on key cloud metrics using the Web UI, the 'tcld' CLI utility, and Temporal Cloud APIs.
For example, during the process of adding a region to a Namespace, you can see the progress of Workflow replication.
Errors -- if any occur -- will also surface in the Namespace Web UI.

:::tip

You may notice that multi-region Namespace shows twice (2x) the Action count in temporal_cloud_v0_total_action_count.
This doubling happens due to replication.

## Auditing operational events

Temporal Cloud provides several ways to audit events:

- When Temporal triggers failovers, the audit log updates with details.
  Look specifically for "operation": "FailoverNamespace" in the logs.
- You can set alerts for Temporal-initiated failover events.
- After a failover, you can check that the Namespace is active in the new region using the Temporal Cloud Web UI.
