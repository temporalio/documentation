You can access Temporal Cloud from anywhere with Internet connectivity, no matter where your Temporal Cloud Namespaces are physically located.
Your applications can live in the cloud environment or data center of your choice.
With that in mind, you _will_ reduce latency by creating Namespaces in a region close to where you host your Workers.

This page enumerates the current regions supported by Temporal Cloud Namespaces.
