## Multi-region Namespace SLA {#sla}

**What guarantees does Temporal offer for multi-region Namespaces?**

Multi-region Namespaces offer 99.99% availability, enforced by Temporal Cloud's [service error rates SLA](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla).
Our system is designed to limit data loss after recovery when the incident triggering the failover is resolved.

Our recovery point objective ([RPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Point_Objective)) is near-zero.
There may be a short period of time during an incident or forced failover when some data is unavailable in the standby region.
Some Workflow History data won't arrive until networks issue are fixed, enabling the History to finish replicating and the divergent History branches to reconcile.

Temporal Cloud proactively responds to incidents by triggering failovers.
Our recovery time objective ([RTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Time_Objective)) is 20 minutes or less per incident.

:::info

During a disaster scenario in which the data on the hard drives in the active region cannot be recovered, the duration of data loss may be as high as the [replication lag](/cloud/multi-region#replication-lag) at the time of disaster.

### Regional availability {#regional-availability}

Multi-region Namespaces are available in all existing [Temporal Cloud regions](/cloud/service-availability#regions).

:::tip

Namespace pairing is currently limited to regions within the same continent.
South America is excluded as only one region is available.
