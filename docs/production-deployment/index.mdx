**Ready to elevate your durable application into production?**

To take your application to production, you deploy your application code, including your Workflows, Activities, and Workers, on your infrastructure using your existing build, test and deploy tools.

Then you need a production-ready Temporal Service to coordinate the execution of your Workflows and Activities.

You can use Temporal Cloud, a fully-managed platform, or you can self-host the service.

## Use Temporal Cloud

You can let us handle the operations of running the Temporal Service, and focus on your application.
Follow the [Temporal Cloud guide](/cloud) to get started.

<div className="tdiw">
  <div className="tditw">
    <p className="tdit">Connect your application instances to Temporal Cloud</p>
  </div>
  <div className="tdiiw" height="742">
    <img
      className="img_ev3q"
      src="/diagrams/basic-platform-topology-cloud.svg"
      alt="Connect your application instances to Temporal Cloud"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Run a Self-hosted Temporal Service

Alternatively, you can run your own production level Temporal Service to orchestrate your durable applications.
Follow the [Self-hosted guide](/self-hosted-guide) to get started.

<div className="tdiw">
  <div className="tditw">
    <p className="tdit">
      Connect your application instances to your self-hosted Temporal Service
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="tdiiw" height="879">
    <img
      className="img_ev3q"
      src="/diagrams/basic-platform-topology-self-hosted.svg"
      alt="Connect your application instances to your self-hosted Temporal Service"
    />
  </div>
</div>
