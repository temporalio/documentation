:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is now [Generally Available](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#general-availability).
Learn why you should use Nexus in the [evaluation guide](/evaluate/nexus).

:::

[Temporal Nexus](/nexus) connects Temporal Applications across Namespaces with built-in durability, security, and fault isolation.

## Enable Nexus

Enable Nexus by updating your static configuration and dynamic config.
Nexus is supported in single-cluster setups only.
See [Nexus Architecture](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/docs/architecture/nexus.md) for operational details.

:::note
Replace `$PUBLIC_URL` with a URL value that's accessible to external callers or internally within the cluster.
Currently, external Nexus calls are considered experimental so it should be safe to use the address of an internal load balancer for the Frontend Service.
:::

To enable Nexus in your deployment:

1. Enable the HTTP API in the server's static configuration.

   ```yaml
   services:
     frontend:
       rpc:
         # NOTE: keep other fields as they were
         httpPort: 7243

   clusterMetadata:
     # NOTE: keep other fields as they were
     clusterInformation:
       active:
         # NOTE: keep other fields as they were
         httpAddress: $PUBLIC_URL:7243
   ```

2. Set the required dynamic configuration.
    1. **Prior to version 1.30.X**: Enable Nexus, set the callback URL, and configure allowed callback addresses.

       **NOTE**: the callback endpoint template and allowed addresses should be set when using the experimental
       "external" endpoint targets.

       ```yaml
       system.enableNexus:
         - value: true
       component.nexusoperations.callback.endpoint.template:
         # The URL must be publicly accessible if the callback is meant to be called by external services.
         # When using Nexus for cross namespace calls, the URL's host is irrelevant as the address is resolved using
         # membership. The URL is a Go template that interpolates the `NamepaceName` and `NamespaceID` variables.
         - value: https://$PUBLIC_URL:7243/namespaces/{{.NamespaceName}}/nexus/callback
       component.callbacks.allowedAddresses:
         # Limits which callback URLs are accepted by the server.
         # Wildcard patterns (*) and insecure (HTTP) callbacks are intended for development only.
         # For production, restrict allowed hosts and set AllowInsecure to false
         # whenever HTTPS/TLS is supported. Allowing HTTP increases MITM and data exposure risk.
         - value:
             - Pattern: "*" # Update to restrict allowed callers, e.g. "*.example.com"
               AllowInsecure: true # In production, set to false and ensure traffic is HTTPS/TLS encrypted
       ```

    2. **Version 1.30.X+**: Nexus is enabled by default. Only the system callback URL is needed.
       ```yaml
       component.nexusoperations.useSystemCallbackURL:
         - value: true
       ```
