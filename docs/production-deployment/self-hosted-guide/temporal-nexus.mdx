:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview).
Learn why you should use Nexus in the [evaluation guide](/evaluate/nexus).

:::

[Temporal Nexus](/nexus) allows you to reliably connect Temporal Applications.
It was designed with Durable Execution in mind and enables each team to have their own Namespace for improved modularity, security, debugging, and fault isolation.

## Enable Nexus

Enable Nexus in your self-hosted Temporal Service by updating the server's static configuration file and enabling Nexus through dynamic config, then setting the public callback URL and allowed callback addresses.
Nexus is only supported in single cluster setups at this time.
For additional information on operating Nexus workloads in your self-hosted cluster, see [Nexus Architecture](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/docs/architecture/nexus.md).

:::note
Replace `$PUBLIC_URL` with a URL value that's accessible to external callers or internally within the cluster.
Currently, external Nexus calls are considered experimental so it should be safe to use the address of an internal load balancer for the Frontend Service.
:::

To enable Nexus in your deployment:

1. Ensure that the server's static configuration file enables the HTTP API.

   ```yaml
   services:
     frontend:
       rpc:
         # NOTE: keep other fields as they were
         httpPort: 7243

   clusterMetadata:
     # NOTE: keep other fields as they were
     clusterInformation:
       active:
         # NOTE: keep other fields as they were
         httpAddress: $PUBLIC_URL:7243
   ```

2. Enable Nexus through dynamic config, set the public callback URL, and set the allowed callback addresses.

   ```yaml
   system.enableNexus:
     - value: true
   component.nexusoperations.callback.endpoint.template:
     # The URL must be publicly accessible if the callback is meant to be called by external services.
     # When using Nexus for cross namespace calls, the URL's host is irrelevant as the address is resolved using
     # membership. The URL is a Go template that interpolates the `NamepaceName` and `NamespaceID` variables.
     - value: https://$PUBLIC_URL:7243/namespaces/{{.NamespaceName}}/nexus/callback
   component.callbacks.allowedAddresses:
     # This list is a security mechanism for limiting which callback URLs are accepted by the server.
     # Attackers may leverage the callback mechanism to force the server to call arbitrary URLs.
     # The config below is only recommended for development, tune this to your requirements.
     - value:
         - Pattern: "*"
           AllowInsecure: true
   ```

## Build and use Nexus Services

Nexus has a familiar programming model to build and use Nexus Services using the Temporal SDK.
The [Nexus Operation lifecycle](/nexus/operations#operation-lifecycle) supports both synchronous and asynchronous Operations.
Nexus Operations can be implemented with Temporal primitives, like a Workflow, or execute arbitrary code.
