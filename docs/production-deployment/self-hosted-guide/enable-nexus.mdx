Nexus is only supported in single cluster setups for the time being due to endpoint registry replication not being implemented yet. 
Enable Nexus in your self-hosted Temporal Service by updating the server's static configuration file and enabling Nexus through dynamic config, then setting the public callback URL and allowed callback addresses.

## Enabling Nexus

To enable Nexus in your deployment:

1. Ensure that the server's static configuration file enables the HTTP API.

    ```yaml
    services:
      frontend:
        rpc:
          # NOTE: keep other fields as they were
          httpPort: 7243

    clusterMetadata:
      # NOTE: keep other fields as they were
      clusterInformation:
        active:
          # NOTE: keep other fields as they were
          httpAddress: $PUBLIC_URL:7243
    ```

2. Enable Nexus through dynamic config, set the public callback URL, and set the allowed callback addresses.

    ```yaml
    system.enableNexus:
      - value: true
    component.nexusoperations.callback.endpoint.template:
      # The URL must be publicly accessible if the callback is meant to be called by external services.
      # When using Nexus for cross namespace calls, the URL's host is irrelevant as the address is resolved using
      # membership. The URL is a Go template that interpolates the `NamepaceName` and `NamespaceID` variables.
      - value: https://$PUBLIC_URL:7243/namespaces/{{.NamespaceName}}/nexus/callback
    component.callbacks.allowedAddresses:
      # This list is a security mechanism for limiting which callback URLs are accepted by the server.
      # Attackers may leverage the callback mechanism to force the server to call arbitrary URLs.
      # The config below is only recommended for development, tune this to your requirements.
      - value:
          - Pattern: "*"
            AllowInsecure: true
    ```
