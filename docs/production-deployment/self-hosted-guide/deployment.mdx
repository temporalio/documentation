There are many ways to self-host a [Temporal Service](/temporal-service).
The right way for you depends entirely on your use case and where you plan to run it.

For step-by-step guides on deploying and configuring Temporal, refer to our [Infrastructure tutorials](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/infrastructure/).

### Minimum requirements

The Temporal Server depends on a database.

Supported databases include the following:

- [Apache Cassandra](/self-hosted-guide/visibility#cassandra)
- [MySQL](/self-hosted-guide/visibility#mysql)
- [PostgreSQL](/self-hosted-guide/visibility#postgresql)
- [SQLite](/self-hosted-guide/visibility#sqlite)

### Docker & Docker Compose

You can run a Temporal Service in [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) containers using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).

If you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, all you need to do is clone the [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) repo and run the `docker compose up` command from its root.

The `temporalio/docker-compose` repo comes loaded with a variety of configuration templates that enable you to try all three databases that the Temporal Platform supports (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cassandra).
It also enables you to try [Advanced Visibility](/visibility#advanced-visibility) using [Search Attributes](/search-attribute), emit metrics, and even play with the [Archival](/temporal-service/archival) feature.

:::warning Docker Image Changes

The `temporalio/auto-setup` image is **deprecated** and no longer receives updates.

For example configurations and setup guidance, refer to the [samples-server repository](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server) instead.

:::

:::tip Local Development Alternative

For local development and testing, use the Temporal CLI's built-in development server:

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

This provides:
- A local Temporal Server with Web UI (http://localhost:8233)
- Automatic creation of the `default` Namespace
- Optional persistence with `--db-filename` for SQLite storage
- Custom Search Attributes with `--search-attribute`

See [`temporal server start-dev`](/cli/server#start-dev) for all options.

:::

The following commands start and run a Temporal Service in Docker using the default configuration:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
cd docker-compose
docker compose up
```

Local [Temporal Clients](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) and [Workers](/workers) can connect to the Temporal Service running in Docker at 127.0.0.1:7233 (default connection for most SDKs) and the Temporal Web UI at 127.0.0.1:8080.

To try other configurations (different dependencies and databases), or to try a custom Docker image, follow the [temporalio/docker-compose README](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose/blob/main/README.md).

### Temporal Server binaries

You can run a complete Temporal Server by deploying just two Go binaries -- the [core Temporal Server](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/), and the [Temporal UI Server](https://github.com/temporalio/ui-server/releases).
Refer to our [tutorial site](https://learn.temporal.io/) for more details on how to deploy Temporal binaries behind an [Nginx reverse proxy](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/infrastructure/nginx-sqlite-binary/) or an [Envoy edge proxy](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/infrastructure/envoy-sqlite-binary/).

Each service can also be deployed separately.
For example, if you are using Kubernetes, you could have one service per pod, so they can scale independently in the future.

In Docker, you could run each service in its own container, using the `SERVICES` flag to specify the service:

```bash
docker run
    # persistence/schema setup flags omitted
    -e SERVICES=history \                      -- Spin up one or more: history, matching, worker, frontend
    -e LOG_LEVEL=debug,info \                           -- Logging level
    -e DYNAMIC_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=config/foo.yaml         -- Dynamic config file to be watched
    temporalio/server:<tag>
```

:::note Server Image Changes

The `temporalio/server` image has been streamlined to include only production-essential components. The following tools have been removed:

- `temporal` CLI
- `dockerize` (replaced with embedded `sprig` templating)
- `curl`
- `bash`

Configuration templating now uses embedded `sprig` instead of `dockerize`. See [Configuration Templating](#configuration-templating) for details.

:::

The environment variables supported by the Temporal Docker images are documented [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/server).

:::warning Deprecated: Auto Setup Image

The `temporalio/auto-setup` Docker image is deprecated and no longer receives updates. For initial schema setup and example configurations, refer to:

- [samples-server repository](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server) for setup examples
- Manual schema setup instructions in the [Visibility guide](/self-hosted-guide/visibility)
- The `temporal-elasticsearch-tool` in the `temporalio/admin-tools` image for Elasticsearch setup

:::

### Configuration Templating

Configuration templating has changed from using the external `dockerize` tool to embedded `sprig` templating built directly into the Temporal Server binary.

#### What Changed

- **Previously:** `dockerize` processed configuration templates with custom helper functions
- **Now:** `sprig` templating is embedded in the server binary, and the default config template is embedded (not a separate file)

#### Migration Notes

If you use custom configuration templates, be aware that:
- Some template syntax has changed (particularly `.Env` and `default` function usage)
- Refer to the [sprig documentation](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) for supported template functions
- Use `temporal-server render-config` to verify your templates render correctly

Default configuration loading now uses the embedded template instead of searching the filesystem.

#### Helm Chart Configuration

When deploying with Helm charts (version 0.73.1 or later), the following configuration options control the dockerize to sprig migration:

| Configuration Option | Description | Default |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| `server.useEntrypointScript` | Use entrypoint script that auto-detects dockerize vs sprig | `false` |
| `server.configMapsToMount` | Which config template to mount: `"dockerize"`, `"sprig"`, or `"both"` | `"dockerize"` |
| `server.setConfigFilePath` | Set `TEMPORAL_SERVER_CONFIG_FILE_PATH` env var (required for sprig) | `false` |

### Importing the Server package

The Temporal Server is a standalone Go application that can be [imported](/references/server-options) into another project.

You might want to do this to pass custom plugins or any other customizations through the [Server Options](/references/server-options).
Then you can build and run a binary that contains your customizations.

This requires Go v1.19 or later, as specified in the Temporal Server [Build prerequisites](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-prerequisites).

### Helm charts

[Temporal Helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts) enable you to get a Temporal Service running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) by deploying the Temporal Server services to individual pods and connecting them to your existing database and Elasticsearch instances.

The Temporal Helm charts repo contains [extensive documentation](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts/blob/main/README.md) about Kubernetes deployments.

:::warning Helm Chart Breaking Changes

**Important compatibility requirements:**

- Existing Helm chart versions are **not compatible** with `server` and `admin-tools` images **version 1.30 and later**
- You **cannot** override existing chart versions with newer images
- **Required Helm chart version:** [temporal-0.73.1](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts/releases/tag/temporal-0.73.1) **or later**

If you are using Temporal Server images 1.30+, you must upgrade to Helm chart version 0.73.1 or later.

**Note:** Temporal Cloud deployments are not impacted by these changes.
