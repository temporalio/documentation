There are many ways to self-host a [Temporal Service](/temporal-service).
The right way for you depends entirely on your use case and where you plan to run it.

For step-by-step guides on deploying and configuring Temporal, refer to our [Infrastructure tutorials](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/infrastructure/).

### Minimum requirements

The Temporal Server depends on a database.

Supported databases include the following:

- [Apache Cassandra](/self-hosted-guide/visibility#cassandra)
- [MySQL](/self-hosted-guide/visibility#mysql)
- [PostgreSQL](/self-hosted-guide/visibility#postgresql)
- [SQLite](/self-hosted-guide/visibility#sqlite)

### Docker & Docker Compose

You can run a Temporal Service in [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) containers using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).

If you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, all you need to do is clone the [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) repo and run the `docker compose up` command from its root.

The `temporalio/docker-compose` repo comes loaded with a variety of configuration templates that enable you to try all three databases that the Temporal Platform supports (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cassandra).
It also enables you to try [Advanced Visibility](/visibility#advanced-visibility) using [Search Attributes](/search-attribute), emit metrics, and even play with the [Archival](/temporal-service#archival) feature.
The Docker images in this repo are produced using the Temporal Server [auto-setup.sh](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-builds/blob/main/docker/auto-setup.sh) script.
This script defaults to creating images that run all the Temporal Server services in a single process.
You can use this script as a starting point for producing your own images.

The following commands start and run a Temporal Service in Docker using the default configuration:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
cd docker-compose
docker compose up
```

Local [Temporal Clients](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) and [Workers](/workers) can connect to the Temporal Service running in Docker at 127.0.0.1:7233 (default connection for most SDKs) and the Temporal Web UI at 127.0.0.1:8080.

To try other configurations (different dependencies and databases), or to try a custom Docker image, follow the [temporalio/docker-compose README](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose/blob/main/README.md).

### Temporal Server binaries

You can run a complete Temporal Server by deploying just two Go binaries -- the [core Temporal Server](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/), and the [Temporal UI Server](https://github.com/temporalio/ui-server/releases).
Refer to our [tutorial site](https://learn.temporal.io/) to learn how to deploy Temporal binaries behind an [Nginx reverse proxy](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/infrastructure/nginx-sqlite-binary/) or an [Envoy edge proxy](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/infrastructure/envoy-sqlite-binary/).

Each service can also be deployed separately.
For example, if you are using Kubernetes, you could have one service per pod, so they can scale independently in the future.

In Docker, you could run each service in its own container, using the `SERVICES` flag to specify the service:

```bash
docker run
    # persistence/schema setup flags omitted
    -e SERVICES=history \                      -- Spin up one or more: history, matching, worker, frontend
    -e LOG_LEVEL=debug,info \                           -- Logging level
    -e DYNAMIC_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=config/foo.yaml         -- Dynamic config file to be watched
    temporalio/server:<tag>
```

The environment variables supported by the Temporal Docker images are documented [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/auto-setup).

Each Temporal Server release ships an [Auto Setup](https://temporal.io/blog/auto-setup) Docker image that includes an [auto-setup.sh](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-builds/blob/main/docker/auto-setup.sh) script.
We recommend using this script for initial schema setup of each supported database.

### Importing the Server package

The Temporal Server is a standalone Go application that can be [imported](/references/server-options) into another project.

You might want to do this to pass custom plugins or any other customizations through the [Server Options](/references/server-options).
Then you can build and run a binary that contains your customizations.

This requires Go v1.19 or later, as specified in the Temporal Server [Build prerequisites](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-prerequisites).

### Helm charts

[Temporal Helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts) enable you to get a Temporal Service running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) by deploying the Temporal Server services to individual pods and connecting them to your existing database and Elasticsearch instances.

The Temporal Helm charts repo contains [extensive documentation](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts/blob/main/README.md) about Kubernetes deployments.
