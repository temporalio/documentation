A [Visibility](/temporal-service/visibility) store is set up as a part of your
[Persistence store](/temporal-service/persistence) to enable listing and filtering details about Workflow Executions
that exist on your Temporal Service.

A Visibility store is required in a Temporal Service setup because it is used by Temporal Web UI and CLI to pull
Workflow Execution data and enables features like batch operations on a group of Workflow Executions.

With the Visibility store, you can use [List Filters](/list-filter) with [Search Attributes](/search-attribute) to list
and filter Workflow Executions that you want to review.

Setting up [advanced Visibility](/visibility#advanced-visibility) enables access to creating and using multiple custom
Search Attributes with your List Filters.

For details, see [Search Attributes](/search-attribute).

Note that if you use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite as your Visibility store, Temporal Server version 1.20 and later
supports advanced Visibility features on MySQL (version 8.0.17 and later), PostgreSQL (version 12 and later) and SQLite
(v3.31.0 and later), in addition to Elasticsearch.

To enable advanced Visibility on your SQL databases, ensure that you do the following:

- [Upgrade your Temporal Server](/self-hosted-guide/upgrade-server#upgrade-server) to version 1.20 or later.
- [Update your database schemas](/self-hosted-guide/upgrade-server#upgrade-server) for MySQL to version 8.0.17 (or
  later), PostgreSQL to version 12 (or later), or SQLite to v3.31.0 (or later).

Beginning with Temporal Server v1.21, you can set up a secondary Visibility store in your Temporal Service to enable
[Dual Visibility](/dual-visibility). This is useful for migrating your Visibility store database.

#### Supported databases

The following databases are supported as Visibility stores:

- [MySQL](#mysql) v5.7 and later. Use v8.0.17 (or later) with Temporal Server v1.20 or later for advanced Visibility
  capabilities. Because standard Visibility is deprecated beginning with Temporal Server v1.21, support for older
  versions of MySQL will be dropped.
- [PostgreSQL](#postgresql) v9.6 and later. Use v12 (or later) with Temporal Server v1.20 or later for advanced
  Visibility capabilities. Because standard Visibility is deprecated beginning with Temporal Server v1.21, support for
  older versions of PostgreSQL will be dropped.
- [SQLite](#sqlite) v3.31.0 and later for advanced Visibility capabilities.
- [Cassandra](#cassandra). Support for Cassandra as a Visibility database is deprecated beginning with Temporal Server
  v1.21. For information on migrating from Cassandra to any of the supported databases, see
  [Migrating Visibility database](#migrating-visibility-database).
- [Elasticsearch](#elasticsearch) supported versions. We recommend operating a Temporal Service with Elasticsearch as
  your Visibility store for any use case that spawns more than a few Workflow Executions.

You can use any combination of the supported databases for your Persistence and Visibility stores. For updates, check
[Server release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases).

## How to set up MySQL Visibility store {#mysql}

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

- MySQL v5.7 and later.
- Support for MySQL v5.7 will be deprecated for all Temporal Server versions after v1.20.
- With Temporal Server version 1.20 and later, advanced Visibility is available on MySQL v8.0.17 and later.

:::

You can set MySQL as your [Visibility store](/temporal-service/visibility). Verify
[supported versions](/self-hosted-guide/visibility) before you proceed.

If using MySQL v8.0.17 or later as your Visibility store with Temporal Server v1.20 and later, any
[custom Search Attributes](/search-attribute#custom-search-attribute) that you create must be associated with a
Namespace in that Temporal Service.

### Persistence configuration

Set your MySQL Visibility store name in the `visibilityStore` parameter in your Persistence configuration, and then
define the Visibility store configuration under `datastores`.

The following example shows how to set a Visibility store `mysql-visibility` and define the datastore configuration in
your Temporal Service configuration YAML.

```yaml
#...
persistence:
  #...
  visibilityStore: mysql-visibility
  #...
  datastores:
    default:
      #...
    mysql-visibility:
      sql:
        pluginName: 'mysql8' # For MySQL v8.0.17 and later. For earlier versions, use "mysql" plugin.
        databaseName: 'temporal_visibility'
        connectAddr: ' ' # Remote address of this database; for example, 127.0.0.0:3306
        connectProtocol: ' ' # Protocol example: tcp
        user: 'username_for_auth'
        password: 'password_for_auth'
        maxConns: 2
        maxIdleConns: 2
        maxConnLifetime: '1h'
#...
```

For details on the configuration parameters and values, see
[Temporal Service configuration](/references/configuration#sql).

To enable advanced Visibility features on your MySQL Visibility store, upgrade to MySQL v8.0.17 or later with Temporal
Server v1.20 or later. See [Upgrade Server](/self-hosted-guide/upgrade-server#upgrade-server) on how to upgrade your
Temporal Server and database schemas.

For example configuration templates, see
[MySQL Visibility store configuration](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/config/development-mysql8.yaml).

### Database schema and setup

Visibility data is stored in a database table called `executions_visibility` and must be created using the schema for
[MySQL v8.0.17 and later](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/main/schema/mysql/v8/visibility).

The following example shows how to set up your MySQL as both your persistence and Visibility store using
`temporal-sql-tool`. Refer to the
[samples-server repository](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/main/compose/scripts) for more examples
with different databases.

{/* SNIPSTART compose-mysql-setup */}

to run the setup.

## How to set up PostgreSQL Visibility store {#postgresql}

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

- PostgreSQL v9.6 and later.
- With Temporal Service version 1.20 and later, advanced Visibility is available on PostgreSQL v12 and later.
- Support for PostgreSQL v9.6 through v11 will be deprecated for all Temporal Server versions after v1.20; we recommend
  upgrading to PostgreSQL 12 or later.

:::

You can set PostgreSQL as your [Visibility store](/temporal-service/visibility). Verify
[supported versions](/self-hosted-guide/visibility) before you proceed.

If using PostgreSQL v12 or later as your Visibility store with Temporal Server v1.20 and later, any
[custom Search Attributes](/search-attribute#custom-search-attribute) that you create must be associated with a
Namespace in that Temporal Service.

### Persistence configuration

Set your PostgreSQL Visibility store name in the `visibilityStore` parameter in your Persistence configuration, and then
define the Visibility store configuration under `datastores`.

The following example shows how to set a Visibility store `postgres-visibility` and define the datastore configuration
in your Temporal Service configuration YAML.

```yaml
#...
persistence:
  #...
  visibilityStore: postgres-visibility
  #...
  datastores:
    default:
    #...
    postgres-visibility:
      sql:
        pluginName: 'postgres12' # For PostgreSQL v12 and later. For earlier versions, use "postgres" plugin.
        databaseName: 'temporal_visibility'
        connectAddr: ' ' # remote address of this database; for example, 127.0.0.0:5432
        connectProtocol: ' ' # protocol example: tcp
        user: 'username_for_auth'
        password: 'password_for_auth'
        maxConns: 2
        maxIdleConns: 2
        maxConnLifetime: '1h'
#...
```

To enable advanced Visibility features on your PostgreSQL Visibility store, upgrade to PostgreSQL v12 or later with
Temporal Server v1.20 or later. See [Upgrade Server](/self-hosted-guide/upgrade-server#upgrade-server) for details on
how to upgrade your Temporal Server and database schemas.

### Database schema and setup

Visibility data is stored in a database table called `executions_visibility` and must be created using the schema for
[PostgreSQL v12 and later](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/main/schema/postgresql/v12/visibility)

The following example shows how to set up your PostgreSQL as both persistence and Visibility store using
`temporal-sql-tool`. Refer to the
[samples-server repository](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/main/compose/scripts) for more examples
with different databases.

to run the setup.

## How to set up SQLite Visibility store {#sqlite}

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

- SQLite v3.31.0 and later.

:::

You can set SQLite as your [Visibility store](/temporal-service/visibility). Verify
[supported versions](/self-hosted-guide/visibility) before you proceed.

Temporal supports only an in-memory database with SQLite; this means that the database is automatically created when
Temporal Server starts and is destroyed when Temporal Server stops.

You can change the configuration to use a file-based database so that it is preserved when Temporal Server stops.
However, if you use a file-based SQLite database, upgrading your database schema to enable advanced Visibility features
is not supported; in this case, you must delete the database and create it again to upgrade.

If using SQLite v3.31.0 and later as your Visibility store with Temporal Server v1.20 and later, any
[custom Search Attributes](/search-attribute#custom-search-attribute) that you create must be associated with a
Namespace in that Temporal Service.

### Persistence configuration

Set your SQLite Visibility store name in the `visibilityStore` parameter in your Persistence configuration, and then
define the Visibility store configuration under `datastores`.

The following example shows how to set a Visibility store `sqlite-visibility` and define the datastore configuration in
your Temporal Service configuration YAML.

```yaml
persistence:
  # ...
  visibilityStore: sqlite-visibility
  # ...
  datastores:
    # ...
    sqlite-visibility:
      sql:
        user: 'username_for_auth'
        password: 'password_for_auth'
        pluginName: 'sqlite'
        databaseName: 'default'
        connectAddr: 'localhost'
        connectProtocol: 'tcp'
        connectAttributes:
          mode: 'memory'
          cache: 'private'
        maxConns: 1
        maxIdleConns: 1
        maxConnLifetime: '1h'
        tls:
          enabled: false
          caFile: ''
          certFile: ''
          keyFile: ''
          enableHostVerification: false
          serverName: ''
```

SQLite (v3.31.0 and later) has advanced Visibility enabled by default.

### Database schema and setup

Visibility data is stored in a database table called `executions_visibility` that must be set up according to the
schemas defined (by supported versions) in
https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/schema/sqlite/v3/visibility/schema.sql.

For an example of setting up the SQLite schema, see
[Temporalite](https://github.com/temporalio/temporalite/blob/main/server.go) setup.

## How to set up Cassandra Visibility store {#cassandra}

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

- Support for Cassandra as a Visibility database is deprecated beginning with Temporal Server v1.21. For updates, check
  the [Temporal Server release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases).
- We recommend migrating from Cassandra to any of the other supported databases for Visibility.

:::

You can set Cassandra as your [Visibility store](/temporal-service/visibility). Verify
[supported versions](/self-hosted-guide/visibility) before you proceed.

Advanced Visibility is not supported with Cassandra.

To enable advanced Visibility features, use any of the supported databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or
Elasticsearch, as your Visibility store. We recommend using Elasticsearch for any Temporal Service setup that handles
more than a few Workflow Executions because it supports the request load on the Visibility store and helps optimize
performance.

To migrate from Cassandra to a supported SQL database, see
[Migrating Visibility database](#migrating-visibility-database).

### Persistence configuration

Set your Cassandra Visibility store name in the `visibilityStore` parameter in your Persistence configuration, and then
define the Visibility store configuration under `datastores`.

The following example shows how to set a Visibility store `cass-visibility` and define the datastore configuration in
your Temporal Service configuration YAML.

```yaml
#...
persistence:
  #...
  visibilityStore: cass-visibility
  #...
  datastores:
    default:
    #...
    cass-visibility:
      cassandra:
        hosts: '127.0.0.1'
        keyspace: 'temporal_visibility'
#...
```

### Database schema and setup

Visibility data is stored in a database table called `executions_visibility` that must be set up according to the
schemas defined (by supported versions) in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/main/schema/cassandra/visibility.

The following example shows how to set up your Cassandra Visibility store using `temporal-cassandra-tool`. For more
examples with different databases, refer to the
[samples-server repository](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/main/compose/scripts).

```bash
#...
# set your Cassandra environment variables
: "${KEYSPACE:=temporal}"
: "${VISIBILITY_KEYSPACE:=temporal_visibility}"

: "${CASSANDRA_SEEDS:=}"
: "${CASSANDRA_PORT:=9042}"
: "${CASSANDRA_USER:=}"
: "${CASSANDRA_PASSWORD:=}"
: "${CASSANDRA_TLS_ENABLED:=}"
: "${CASSANDRA_CERT:=}"
: "${CASSANDRA_CERT_KEY:=}"
: "${CASSANDRA_CA:=}"
: "${CASSANDRA_REPLICATION_FACTOR:=1}"
#...
# set connection details
#...
# set up Cassandra schema
setup_cassandra_schema() {
  #...
  # use valid schema for the version of the database you want to set up for Visibility
    VISIBILITY_SCHEMA_DIR=${TEMPORAL_HOME}/schema/cassandra/visibility/versioned
    if [[ ${SKIP_DB_CREATE} != true ]]; then
        temporal-cassandra-tool --ep "${CASSANDRA_SEEDS}" create -k "${VISIBILITY_KEYSPACE}" --rf "${CASSANDRA_REPLICATION_FACTOR}"
    fi
    temporal-cassandra-tool --ep "${CASSANDRA_SEEDS}" -k "${VISIBILITY_KEYSPACE}" setup-schema -v 0.0
    temporal-cassandra-tool --ep "${CASSANDRA_SEEDS}" -k "${VISIBILITY_KEYSPACE}" update-schema -d "${VISIBILITY_SCHEMA_DIR}"
  #...
}
```

## How to integrate Elasticsearch into a Temporal Service {#elasticsearch}

You can integrate Elasticsearch with your Temporal Service as your Visibility store. We recommend using Elasticsearch
for large-scale operations on the Temporal Service.

To integrate Elasticsearch with your Temporal Service, edit the `persistence` section of your `development.yaml`
configuration file to add Elasticsearch as the `visibilityStore`, and run the index schema setup commands.

### Persistence configuration

Set your Elasticsearch Visibility store name in the `visibilityStore` parameter in your Persistence configuration, and
then define the Visibility store configuration under `datastores`.

The following example shows how to set a Visibility store named `es-visibility` and define the datastore configuration
in your Temporal Service configuration YAML.

```yaml
persistence:
  ...
  visibilityStore: es-visibility
  datastores:
    ...
    es-visibility: # Define the Elasticsearch datastore connection information under the `es-visibility` key
      elasticsearch:
        version: "v7"
        url:
          scheme: "http"
          host: "127.0.0.1:9200"
        indices:
          visibility: temporal_visibility_v1_dev
```

### Index schema and index

To set up Elasticsearch as your Visibility store, use the `temporal-elasticsearch-tool` available in the
`temporalio/admin-tools` image.

The following example shows how to set up an Elasticsearch Visibility store with a MySQL persistence store using
`temporal-elasticsearch-tool`. For more examples with different databases, refer to the
[samples-server repository](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/tree/main/compose/scripts).

### Elasticsearch privileges

Ensure that the following privileges are granted for the Elasticsearch Temporal index:

- **Read**
  - [index privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices):
    `create`, `index`, `delete`, `read`
- **Write**
  - [index privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices):
    `write`
- **Custom Search Attributes**
  - [index privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices):
    `manage`
  - [cluster privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster):
    `monitor` or `manage`.

## How to set up Dual Visibility {#dual-visibility}

To enable [Dual Visibility](/dual-visibility), set up a secondary Visibility store with your primary Visibility store,
and configure your Temporal Service to enable read and/or write operations on the secondary Visibility store.

With Dual Visibility, you can read from only one Visibility store at a time, but can configure your Temporal Service to
write to primary only, secondary only, or to both primary and secondary stores.

#### Set up secondary Visibility store

Set the secondary store with the `secondaryVisibilityStore` configuration key in your Persistence configuration, and
then define the secondary Visibility store configuration under `datastores`.

You can configure any of the [supported databases](/self-hosted-guide/visibility) as your secondary store.

Examples:

To configure MySQL as a secondary store with Cassandra as your primary store, do the following.

```yaml
persistence:
  visibilityStore: cass-visibility # This is your primary Visibility store
  secondaryVisibilityStore: mysql-visibility # This is your secondary Visibility store
  datastores:
    cass-visibility:
      cassandra:
        hosts: '127.0.0.1'
        keyspace: 'temporal_primary_visibility'
    mysql-visibility:
      sql:
        pluginName: 'mysql8' # Verify supported versions. Use a version of SQL that supports advanced Visibility.
        databaseName: 'temporal_secondary_visibility'
        connectAddr: '127.0.0.1:3306'
        connectProtocol: 'tcp'
        user: 'temporal'
        password: 'temporal'
```

To configure Elasticsearch as both your primary and secondary store, use the configuration key
`elasticsearch.indices.secondary_visibility`, as shown in the following example.

```yaml
persistence:
  visibilityStore: es-visibility
  datastores:
    es-visibility:
      elasticsearch:
        version: 'v7'
        logLevel: 'error'
        url:
          scheme: 'http'
          host: '127.0.0.1:9200'
        indices:
          visibility: temporal_visibility_v1
          secondary_visibility: temporal_visibility_v1_new
        closeIdleConnectionsInterval: 15s
```

#### Database schema and setup

The database schema and setup for a secondary store depends on the database you plan to use.

- [MySQL](#mysql)
- [PostgresSQL](#postgresql)
- [SQLite](#sqlite)
- [Elasticsearch](#elasticsearch)

For the Cassandra and MySQL configuration in the previous example, an example setup script would be as follows.

```bash
#...
# set your Cassandra environment variables
: "${KEYSPACE:=temporal}"
: "${VISIBILITY_KEYSPACE:=temporal_primary_visibility}"

: "${CASSANDRA_SEEDS:=}"
: "${CASSANDRA_PORT:=9042}"

}
```

#### Update Temporal Service configuration

With the primary and secondary stores set, update the `system.secondaryVisibilityWritingMode` and
`system.enableReadFromSecondaryVisibility` configuration keys in your self-hosted Temporal Service's dynamic
configuration YAML file to enable read and/or write operations to the secondary Visibility store.

For example, to enable write operations to both primary and secondary stores, but disable reading from the secondary
store, use the following.

```yaml
system.secondaryVisibilityWritingMode:
  - value: 'dual'
    constraints: {}
system.enableReadFromSecondaryVisibility:
  - value: false
    constraints: {}
```

For details on the configuration options, see:

- [Secondary Visibility dynamic configuration reference](/references/dynamic-configuration#secondary-visibility-settings)
- [Migrating Visibility databases](#migrating-visibility-database)

## How to migrate Visibility database {#migrating-visibility-database}

To migrate your Visibility database, [set up a secondary Visibility store](#dual-visibility) to enable
[Dual Visibility](/dual-visibility), and update the dynamic configuration in your Temporal Service to update the read
and write operations for the Visibility store.

Dual Visibility setup is optional but useful in gradually migrating your Visibility data to another database.

Before you begin, verify [supported databases and versions](/self-hosted-guide/visibility) for a Visibility store.

The following steps describe how to migrate your Visibility database.

After you make any changes to your [Temporal Service configuration](/temporal-service/configuration), ensure that you
restart your services.

#### Set up secondary Visibility store

1. In your Temporal Service configuration,
   [add a secondary Visibility store](/references/configuration#secondaryvisibilitystore) to your Visibility setup under
   the Persistence configuration.

   Example: To migrate from Cassandra to Elasticsearch, add Elasticsearch as your secondary database and set it up. For
   details, see [secondary Visibility database schema and setup](#dual-visibility).

   ```yaml
   persistence:
   visibilityStore: cass-visibility
   secondaryVisibilityStore: es-visibility
   datastores:
     cass-visibility:
     cassandra:
       hosts: '127.0.0.1'
       keyspace: 'temporal_visibility'
     es-visibility:
     elasticsearch:
       version: 'v7'
       logLevel: 'error'
       url:
       scheme: 'http'
       host: '127.0.0.1:9200'
       indices:
       visibility: temporal_visibility_v1_dev
       closeIdleConnectionsInterval: 15s
   ```

1. Update the [dynamic configuration](/temporal-service/configuration#dynamic-configuration) keys on your self-hosted
   Temporal Service to enable write operations to the secondary store and disable read operations. Example:

   ```yaml
   system.secondaryVisibilityWritingMode:
   - value: "dual"
   constraints: {}
   system.enableReadFromSecondaryVisibility:
   - value: false
   constraints: {}
   ```

At this point, Visibility data is read from the primary store, and all Visibility data is written to both the primary
and secondary store. This setting applies only to new Visibility data generated after Dual Visibility is enabled. It
does not migrate any existing data in the primary store to the secondary store.

For details on write options to the secondary store, see
[Secondary Visibility dynamic configuration reference](/references/dynamic-configuration#secondary-visibility-settings).

#### Run in dual mode

When you enable a secondary store, only new Visibility data is written to both primary and secondary stores. The primary
store still holds the Workflow Execution data from before the secondary store was set up.

Running in dual mode lets you plan for closed and open Workflow Executions data from before the secondary store was set
up in your self-hosted Temporal Service.

Example:

- To manage closed Workflow Executions data, run in dual mode until the Namespace
  [Retention Period](/temporal-service/temporal-server#retention-period) is reached. After the Retention Period,
  Workflow Execution data is removed from the Persistence and Visibility stores. If you want to keep the closed Workflow
  Executions data after the set Retention Period, you must set up [Archival](/self-hosted-guide/archival).
- To manage data for all open Workflow Executions, run in dual mode until all the Workflow Executions started before
  enabling Dual Visibility mode are closed. After the Workflow Executions are closed, verify the Retention Period and
  set up Archival if you need to keep the data beyond the Retention Period.

You can run your Visibility setup in dual mode for an indefinite period, or until you are ready to deprecate the primary
store and move completely to the secondary store without losing data.

#### Deprecate primary Visibility store

When you are ready to deprecate your primary store, follow these steps.

1. Update the dynamic configuration YAML to enable read operations from the secondary store. Example:

   ```yaml
   system.secondaryVisibilityWritingMode:
   - value: "dual"
   constraints: {}
   system.enableReadFromSecondaryVisibility:
   - value: true
   constraints: {}
   ```

   At this point, Visibility data is read from the secondary store only. Verify whether data on the secondary store is
   correct.

1. When the secondary store is vetted and ready to replace your current primary store, change your Temporal Service
   configuration to set the secondary store as your primary, and remove the dynamic configuration set in the previous
   steps. Example:

   ```yaml
   persistence:
   visibilityStore: es-visibility
   datastores:
     es-visibility:
     elasticsearch:
       version: 'v7'
       logLevel: 'error'
       url:
       scheme: 'http'
       host: '127.0.0.1:9200'
       indices:
       visibility: temporal_visibility_v1_dev
       closeIdleConnectionsInterval: 15s
   ```

## Managing custom Search Attributes {#custom-search-attributes}

To manage your custom Search Attributes on Temporal Cloud, use `tcld`. With Temporal Cloud, you can create and rename
custom Search Attributes.

To manage your custom Search Attributes on self-hosted Temporal Clusters, use Temporal CLI. With self-hosted Temporal
Service, you can create and remove custom Search Attributes. Note that if you use
[SQL databases](/self-hosted-guide/visibility) with Temporal Server v1.20 and later, creating a custom Search Attribute
creates a mapping with a database field name in the Visibility store `custom_search_attributes` table. Removing a custom
Search Attribute removes this mapping with the database field name but does not remove the data. If you remove a custom
Search Attribute and add a new one, the new custom Search Attribute might be mapped to the database field of the one
that was recently removed. This might cause unexpected results when you use the List API to retrieve results using the
new custom Search Attribute. These constraints do not apply if you use Elasticsearch.

### How to create custom Search Attributes {#create-custom-search-attributes}

Add custom Search Attributes to your Visibility store using the Temporal CLI for a self-hosted Temporal Service and
`tcld` for Temporal Cloud.

Creating a custom Search Attribute in your Visibility store makes it available to use in your Workflow metadata and
[List Filters](/list-filter).

**On Temporal Cloud**

To create custom Search Attributes on Temporal Cloud, use
[`tcld namespace search-attributes add`](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#search-attributes). For example, to add a custom Search
Attributes "CustomSA" to your Temporal Cloud Namespace "YourNamespace", run the following command.
`tcld namespace search-attributes add --namespace YourNamespace --search-attribute "CustomSA"`

**On self-hosted Temporal Service**

If you're self-hosting your Temporal Service, verify whether your [Visibility database](/self-hosted-guide/visibility)
version supports advanced Visibility features.

To create custom Search Attributes in your self-hosted Temporal Service Visibility store, use
`temporal operator search-attribute create` with `--name` and `--type` command options.

For example, to create a Search Attribute called `CustomSA` of type `Keyword`, run the following command:

```
temporal operator search-attribute create --name="CustomSA" --type="Keyword"
```

Note that if you use a SQL database with advanced Visibility capabilities, you are required to specify a Namespace when
creating a custom Search Attribute. For example:

```
temporal operator search-attribute create --name="CustomSA" --type="Keyword" --namespace="yournamespace"
```

You can also create multiple custom Search Attributes when you set up your Visibility store.

The following example shows how custom Search Attributes can be created during Visibility store setup for SQL databases.
For setup examples, refer to the [samples-server repository](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server)

```bash
add_custom_search_attributes() {
    until temporal operator search-attribute list --namespace "${DEFAULT_NAMESPACE}"; do
      echo "Waiting for namespace cache to refresh..."
      sleep 1
    done
    echo "Namespace cache refreshed."

    echo "Adding Custom*Field search attributes."

    temporal operator search-attribute create --namespace "${DEFAULT_NAMESPACE}" --yes \
        --name="CustomKeywordField" --type="Keyword" \
        --name="CustomStringField" --type="Text" \
        --name="CustomTextField" --type="Text" \
        --name="CustomIntField" --type="Int" \
        --name="CustomDatetimeField" --type="Datetime" \
        --name="CustomDoubleField" --type="Double" \
        --name="CustomBoolField" --type="Bool"
}
```

For Temporal Server v1.19 and earlier, or if using Elasticsearch for advanced Visibility, you can create custom Search
Attributes without a Namespace association, as shown in the following example.

{/* CHECK FOR ACCURACY */}

```bash
add_custom_search_attributes() {
       echo "Adding Custom*Field search attributes."
       temporal operator search-attribute create \
        --name="CustomKeywordField" --type="Keyword" \
        --name="CustomStringField" --type="Text" \
        --name="CustomTextField" --type="Text" \
        --name="CustomIntField" --type="Int" \
        --name="CustomDatetimeField" --type="Datetime" \
        --name="CustomDoubleField" --type="Double" \
        --name="CustomBoolField" --type="Bool"
}
```

When your Visibility store is set up and running, these custom Search Attributes are available to use in your Workflow
code.

### How to remove custom Search Attributes {#remove-custom-search-attributes}

To remove a Search Attribute key from your self-hosted Temporal Service Visibility store, use the command
`temporal operator search-attribute remove`. Removing Search Attributes is not supported on Temporal Cloud.

For example, if using Elasticsearch for advanced Visibility, to remove a custom Search Attribute called `CustomSA` of
type Keyword use the following command:

```
temporal operator search-attribute remove \
    --name="your_custom_attribute"
```

With Temporal Server v1.20, if using a SQL database for advanced Visibility, you need to specify the Namespace in your
command, as shown in the following command:

```
temporal operator search-attribute remove \
    --name="your_custom_attribute" \
    --namespace="your_namespace"
```

To check whether the Search Attribute was removed, run

```
temporal operator search-attribute list
```

and check the list.

If you're on Temporal Server v1.20 and later, specify the Namespace from which you removed the Search Attribute. For
example,

```
temporal search-attribute list --namespace="yournamespace"
```

Note that if you use [SQL databases](/self-hosted-guide/visibility) with Temporal Server v1.20 and later, a new custom
Search Attribute is mapped to a database field name in the Visibility store `custom_search_attributes` table. Removing
this custom Search Attribute removes the mapping with the database field name but does not remove the data. If you
remove a custom Search Attribute and add a new one, the new custom Search Attribute might be mapped to the database
field of the one that was recently removed. This might cause unexpected results when you use the List API to retrieve
results using the new custom Search Attribute. These constraints do not apply if you use Elasticsearch.
