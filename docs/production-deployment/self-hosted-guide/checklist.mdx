This page describes common challenges customers face who self-host Temporal and it shares recommendations to mitigate those issues. 

Temporal at its core is about durability and reliability.
This durability is compromised if it is not architected and deployed as a reliable, trusted platform.
This guide provides a path to demonstrate that Temporal consumers can be confident in a Temporal service and provides a list of key tests you as a user should perform against the service, such as:

This guide provides a path to demonstrate that Temporal consumers can be confident in a Temporal service and provides a list of key tests you as a user should perform against the service.

## Self-Hosting Challenge Areas

Significant engineering must be done and ongoing effort is required to resolve these challenges:
- Scalability with spiky or growing workloads
- Global hosting
- Uptime, availability and reliability
- Management and control plane
- Latency, which must be kept low and consistent
- [Security](/self-hosted-guide/security)
- Maintenance and upgrades
- Expert support to users of the service
- Cost management

It is critical to demonstrate confidence in these areas as part of building a mission critical Temporal Service.
Without demonstrated architectural durability, the value of Temporal's [Durable Execution](https://temporal.io/how-it-works) model is compromised.

## Scalability with Variable or Growing Workloads {#scaling-and-metrics}

Workloads can be highly variable, and sustained workload spikes of 5-10x average is common. 
We recommend scaling your clusters to well above the average throughput.
See [Scaling Temporal: The Basics](https://temporal.io/blog/scaling-temporal-the-basics) for an introduction to the topic.

Temporal Server throughput is often limited by the number of [shards](/clusters#history-shard) configured for the Temporal service.
Shard capacity, and often overall cluster throughput, is set at build time for a cluster and that cluster setting cannot be adjusted later.
Adding more shards if needed requires a cluster rebuild, and a migration to the new cluster.

The requirements of your Temporal system will vary widely based on your intended production workload.
You will want to run your own proof of concept tests and watch for key metrics to understand the system health and scaling needs.

**Load testing.** You can use [the Omes benchmarking tool](https://github.com/temporalio/omes/), see how we ourselves [stress test Temporal](https://temporal.io/blog/temporal-deep-dive-stress-testing/), or write your own.

All metrics emitted by the server are [listed in Temporal's source](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/common/metrics/defs.go).
There are also equivalent metrics that you can configure from the client side.
At a high level, you will want to track these 3 categories of metrics:

- **Service metrics**: For each request made by the service handler we emit `service_requests`, `service_errors`, and `service_latency` metrics with `type`, `operation`, and `namespace` tags.
  This gives you basic visibility into service usage and allows you to look at request rates across services, namespaces and even operations.
- **Persistence metrics**: The Server emits `persistence_requests`, `persistence_errors` and `persistence_latency` metrics for each persistence operation.
  These metrics include the `operation` tag such that you can get the request rates, error rates or latencies per operation.
  These are super useful in identifying issues caused by the database.
- **Workflow Execution stats**: The Server also emits counters for when Workflow Executions are complete.
  These are useful in getting overall stats about Workflow Execution completions.
  Use `workflow_success`, `workflow_failed`, `workflow_timeout`, `workflow_terminate` and `workflow_cancel` counters for each type of Workflow Execution completion.
  These include the `namespace` tag.

## Availability

A high level of availability and reliability (99.99%) is a requirement for mission critical deployments.
We recommend testing for this availability level while load testing.
We also recommend validating this level of reliability while doing server upgrades, to ensure no loss of service availability.  

Temporal Clusters can be deployed in as many regions as needed to meet various requirements:
- Data Residency
- Latency
- Security / Isolation
This can multiply the effort to implement and maintain clusters.

[Temporal Cloud is available in 15 AWS regions](/cloud/service-availability).

## Management and Control Plane 

When you experience success with Temporal, you will typically expand your deployment.
Needs can increase, and can go from having one or two production use cases in a single region to many use cases in many regions.
Running multiple clusters is complex work, as each needs its own setup, tuning, and configuration. 

This operational management pain leads to a need to monitor and manage all of your Temporal Services in a unified way.
To do this, you need a layer on top of Temporal to manage multiple clusters: a control plane.
Temporal does not ship an open source control plane. This can be complex to do and take significant effort.

With Temporal Cloud, all namespaces in all regions can be managed from a single view.
The Temporal Cloud control plane allows operators to observe, manage, and control.
Responsibilities for individual namespaces can be delegated using RBAC built into [Temporal Cloud](https://temporal.io/cloud).

Self-hosted Temporal does not support RBAC or audit logging out of the box.
Temporal Cloud provides RBAC and SSO support, audit logging, data encryption, third party penetration test validation, and SOC 2-Type II and HIPAA compliance.

## Maintenance and Upgrades 

Temporal Server releases as often as every two weeks.
Temporal recommends [upgrading sequentially](/self-hosted-guide/upgrade-server), not skipping any minor versions.
It is acceptable to skip patch versions.
Temporal recommends keeping up-to-date and not falling behind on your server versions.
No support is guaranteed for Temporal Server, but very old servers will be hard for even the community to support, so we encourage you to keep up to date. 
In addition to the core service, infrastructure to run Temporal, such as Kubernetes to host the service and data stores for persistence, has to be implemented and maintained.

Temporal service availability can be affected by server upgrades.
We recommend load and availability testing during the upgrade process to understand the performance envelope.

Temporal Cloud updates are managed by the Temporal Cloud team.
Cloud upgrades are seamless.

## Expert Support

Temporal recommends that customer platform teams who are building out a Temporal service gain deep experience across the lifecycle and breadth of a Temporal application.

Specific activities include:
- [Worker tuning](/develop/worker-performance)
- [Worker best practices](/workers)
- Code reviews
- Design guidance
- Training
- Code reviews
- Security reviews
- [Metrics](/references/sdk-metrics) and monitoring
- Technical onboarding

Temporal support provides guidance on all of the above.
Temporal support will work with your teams to make this easier and support teams that support Temporal.


## Cost Management

Running a mission critical, global Temporal Service can be expensive.
Temporal Server is a complex system to run and scale.
We recommend performance testing as outlined above, and planning scaling around your performance requirements.
This implies that Temporal Servers will often be over-sized, but this is necessary to handle unpredictable spiky workloads.
Performance testing can help you right-size your environments.
Running mission critical Temporal as a Service requires multiple Temporal Clusters for high availability and global coverage. 

It is a good practice to have trained, experienced administrators familiar with Temporal server architecture to maintain Temporal servers, with global coverage to maintain a global, mission critical service.
Staffing, training and skill development can be significant costs to maintaining a Temporal Service.

[Temporal Cloud](https://temporal.io/cloud) can be significantly less expensive to set up and scale.
