First [Build your durable application](/dev-guide) with a Temporal SDK, using a development Cluster to supervise your durable Temporal Applications.

Temporal is not opinionated about how or where you deploy your Temporal Application code (Workers).

Use the Temporal Client to integrate your Temporal Application with your existing systems.

**Build with a dev Cluster.**

Then, when it's time to deploy your application to production connect to [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), or connect to a [self-hosted](/self-hosted-guide) Temporal Cluster using Temporal's open source software.

- [Self-hosted guide](/self-hosted-guide)

**Deploying to production can be as simple as updating your connection endpoints to point at Temporal Cloud.**
