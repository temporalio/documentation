At ABC Financial, the ownership of Temporal applications is shared between the **Temporal Platform Team** (who manages Temporal Cloud infrastructure) and **Application Teams** (who build and run Temporal Workflows).

## Decision framework

When in doubt, ask yourself:

* **Does the issue affect multiple teams or namespaces?** → Platform Team
* **Is it business logic or application-specific?** → Application Team
* **Does it require Temporal Cloud `Admin` access?** → Platform Team
