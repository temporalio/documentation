## Temporal Cloud support model

:::note
Specify your support tier so developers understand the SLAs available to them.
:::

At ABC Financial, we have **Enterprise** support for Temporal Cloud. With Enterprise support, Temporal offers the following response time targets for support tickets:

|  | P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Definition | **Production impacted** - Temporal Cloud service is unavailable or degraded with a significant impact. | **Production issue** -  An issue related to production workloads running on the Temporal Cloud service, or a significant project, is blocked. | **General issues** -  General Temporal Cloud service or other issues where there is no production impact or a workaround exists to mitigate the impact. | **General guidance** -  Questions or an issue with the Temporal Cloud service that is not impacting system availability or functionality. |
| Response time target | 30 minutes (24×7) | 1 hour | 4 hours | 1 day |

## How to submit a support ticket

1. Go to [support.temporal.io](http://support.temporal.io).
2. If prompted, log in to Temporal Cloud using the same method you normally use (e.g., Google, Microsoft, email-password, or other methods).
3. You will be presented with a screen where you can view open and closed tickets for your Temporal account, as well as submit a new ticket.
