This guide provides a structured learning path from foundational concepts to advanced patterns, tailored specifically for Software Developers, AI Developers, and Platform Engineers.

Temporal offers free, self-paced training courses that provide a solid grounding in the platform. Developers can sign up for free for these courses using their work emails at [learn.temporal.io](http://learn.temporal.io).

## Foundation

1. [Temporal 101: Introducing the Temporal Platform](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/temporal_101/)
   1. Learn the fundamentals of Temporal, including Workflows, Activities, and the core value proposition of Durable Execution.
2. [Temporal 102: Exploring Durable Execution](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/temporal_102/)
   1. You will acquire skills necessary to use Temporal throughout the development lifecycle by learning how to test, debug, and deploy applications.

## Intermediate

1. [Securing Application Data](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/appdatasec/)
   1. Provides general guidance and example applications for addressing user management, encryption standards, and key rotation.
2. [Interacting with Workflows](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/interacting_with_workflows/)
   1. Learn how to interact with Workflows using Signal, Update, and Query.
3. [Crafting an Error Handling Strategy](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/errstrat/)
   1. You will explore the nature of different types of failures and investigate the support that Temporal provides for addressing them.

## Advanced

The Advanced learning paths are tailored to 3 distinct user personas:

1. [Platform Engineers](#platform-engineer)
2. [Software Developers](#software-developers)
3. [AI Developers](#ai-developers)

### Platform Engineer {#platform-engineer}

1. [Introduction to Temporal Cloud](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/intro_to_temporal_cloud/)
   1. Learn the role of Temporal Cloud, how to log into and navigate its Web UI, and how to perform tasks that new Temporal Cloud users may do in preparation for using this service.
2.  [Best practices | Temporal Platform Documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/best-practices)
   1. Learn the foundational principles and best practices for using Temporal Cloud.

### Software Developers {#software-developers}

1. [Versioning Workflows](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/versioning/)
   1. In this course, you will learn how to safely evolve your Temporal application code in production.
2. [Worker Versioning](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/worker_versioning/)
   1. You will learn the benefits of Worker Versioning and evaluate tradeoffs of various versioning approaches.

### AI Developers {#ai-developers}

1. [Building Durable AI Applications with Temporal](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/ai/building-durable-ai-applications/)
   1. Learn how to build reliable AI applications using Temporal to orchestrate LLM calls, handle retries, and manage complex AI workflows that can recover from failures.
2. [Building Durable MCP Tool with Temporal](https://learn.temporal.io/tutorials/ai/building-mcp-tools-with-temporal/)
   1. Learn how to build long-running Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools using Temporal.
