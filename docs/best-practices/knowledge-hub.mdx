As organizations scale their Temporal adoption, the need for centralized, consistent knowledge becomes critical.
Mature Temporal organizations establish internal knowledge hubs to address common challenges that emerge when multiple teams
adopt Temporal independently.

### The problem

Without a centralized knowledge base, organizations often experience:

- **Fragmented expertise**: Tribal knowledge stays siloed within teams, leading to inconsistent Temporal implementations and
  repeated mistakes across the organization.
- **Slow onboarding**: New developers spend weeks piecing together information from scattered sources, Slack threads, and
  ad-hoc meetings.
- **Inconsistent patterns**: Teams develop their own conventions for Workflow design, error handling, and testing,
  making cross-team collaboration and code reuse difficult.
- **Redundant support burden**: Platform teams answer the same questions repeatedly, diverting resources from strategic
  work.
- **Compliance and security gaps**: Without standardized guidance, teams may inadvertently introduce security
  vulnerabilities or miss compliance requirements.

### Value of a Temporal knowledge hub

Organizations that invest in an internal Temporal knowledge hub see measurable improvements:

| Benefit | Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Accelerated onboarding** | Reduce onboarding from weeks to days with clear learning paths and starter templates. |
| **Consistent standards** | Establish conventions for Namespaces, Workers, and error handling across all teams. |
| **Reduced support toil** | Up to 90% fewer repetitive questions with self-service documentation. |
| **Faster time-to-production** | Ship features faster with validated patterns and decision frameworks. |
| **Improved compliance** | Ensure consistent security controls and access management across teams. |

### Next steps

1. **Use the template**: Start with the [Temporal Platform Hub template](https://kawofong.github.io/temporal-platform-hub/) as your foundation.
It provides a proven structure covering everything from decision frameworks to escalation path.
2. **Assign ownership**: Designate a Platform team to customize the content and keep it current as your
Temporal practice evolves.
3. **Iterate**: Track which pages developers visit most and which questions still come to the Platform
   team. Use this data to continuously improve the documentation.
