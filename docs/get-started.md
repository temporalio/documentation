Temporal reimagines state-dependent service-orchestrated application development, and so much more.

## Quick start

[Install the Temporal server](/docs/server-quick-install/) and [choose your SDK](/docs/sdks-introduction). Or, try one of these application template tutorials:

**Go**

- [Run your first app](/docs/go-run-your-first-app/)
- [Build a "Hello World!" app from scratch](/docs/go-hello-world)

**Java**

- [Run your first app](/docs/java-run-your-first-app/)
- [Build a "Hello World!" app from scratch](/docs/java-hello-world)

[Other SDKs](/docs/sdks-introduction/#other-sdks) are in the works, please get in touch.

## Learn about Temporal

Temporal enables developers to write highly reliable applications without having to worry about all the edge cases, but getting started can be paradigm shift for some. If you are new to Temporal, or Workflow applications in general, get caught up on the [core concepts](/docs/overview/).

Wondering if Temporal is a good fit for your use case? Check out our [use cases section](/docs/use-cases-orchestration/) or visit the [community forum](https://community.temporal.io/tag/use-case-validation).

## Temporal deployment and configuration


There are a few ways to run Temporal. Try out the [quick install guide](/docs/server-quick-install/) or use the [Temporal Helm Chart](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts) to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.

Learn how to [manage Temporal configurations](/docs/server-configuration/), [customize Workflow filtering](/docs/server-workflow-search/), or [set up Archival](/docs/server-archive-data).

## CLI

Learn how to use the [Temporal CLI](/docs/tctl/) to query the backend and get information about Workflows.
