Temporal reimagines state-dependent service-orchestrated application development, and so much more.

## Quick start

[Install the Temporal server](/docs/server-quick-install/) and [choose your SDK](/application-development). Or, try one of these application template tutorials:

**Go**

- [Run your first app](/docs/go-run-your-first-app/)
- [Build a "Hello World!" app from scratch](/docs/go-hello-world)

**Java**

- [Run your first app](/docs/java-run-your-first-app/)
- [Build a "Hello World!" app from scratch](/docs/java-hello-world)

[Other SDKs](/application-development) are in the works, please get in touch.

## Learn about Temporal

The Temporal system as a whole enables developers to write highly reliable applications without having to worry about all the edge cases, but getting started can be paradigm shift for some. If you are new to the Temporal system, or Workflow applications in general, get caught up on the [core concepts](/docs/concept-overview/).

Wondering if the Temporal system is a good fit for your use case? Check out our [use cases section](/docs/use-cases-orchestration/) or visit the [community forum](https://community.temporal.io/tag/use-case-validation).

## Temporal Server

If you are looking to self-host the Temporal Server, start with the [Server introduction](/docs/server-introduction).

Interested in using Temporal Cloud (SaaS)? [Hop on the waitlist](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/cloud-introduction).

## CLI

Learn how to use the [Temporal CLI](/docs/tctl/) to query the backend and get information about Workflows.
