Looking for SDKs in other languages?
There are plans to support many others.
Here is a list of SDKs that are in the works but are not yet officially endorsed:

- [**Ruby SDK**](/docs/ruby-sdk-overview) is in active development - please get in touch on Slack `#ruby-sdk` channel
- [**Node.js/TypeScript SDK**](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node) is in active development - please get in touch on Slack `#nodejs-sdk` channel
- **Python SDK** is [being developed by a community member](https://github.com/firdaus/temporal-python-sdk) - please get in touch on Slack `#python-sdk` channel

These other SDKs have community interest - please get in touch with us if you are interested in using or trying:

- **C#/.Net SDK**
- **Swift SDK**
- **Haskell SDK**
- **Rust SDK**
- **C++ SDK**

If you are interested in using an "unofficial" SDK, we recommend that you reach out to any of us at Temporal.

- [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/temporalio/shared_invite/zt-onhti57l-J0bl~Tr7MqSUnIc1upjRkw)
- [Community forums](https://community.temporal.io/)

We are very excited by the community's enthusiasm and strongly believe in collaborating on open source projects.
Our goal is to make sure there is maintenance leadership in place to care for the developer experience over the long term.
