:::tip

Need to scrape metrics into your observability stack? Try out the new [OpenMetrics endpoint](/cloud/metrics/openmetrics).

:::

Metrics for all Namespaces in your account are available from your metrics endpoint. Keep in mind that your Temporal Cloud metrics lag real-time performance by about one minute. Temporal Cloud also only retains raw metrics for seven days.



To ensure security of your metrics, a CA certificate dedicated to observability is required.
Only clients that use certificates signed by that CA, or that chain up to the CA, can query the metrics endpoint.
For more information about CA certificates in Temporal Cloud, see [Certificate requirements](/cloud/certificates#certificate-requirements).
