<!--- Onboarding guide for Temporal Cloud --->

You received email from Temporal that welcomes you to your new Temporal account.
Your email address is now the first [Global Admin](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) for your account.

To get started with Temporal Cloud, follow these onboarding steps:

<!--- 1. [Create an account.](#create-an-account-in-temporal-cloud) --->

1. [Issue CA certificates](#issue-ca-certificates).
1. [Create a Namespace](#create-a-namespace).
1. [Invite users](#invite-users).
1. [Connect to Temporal Cloud](#connect-to-temporal-cloud).

## Get started - Certificates {#issue-ca-certificates}

You must provide your own certificates to access Temporal Cloud.
For certificate requirements, see the following:

- [Requirements for CA certificates](/cloud/certificates#certificate-requirements)
- [Issue root CA and end-entity certificates](/cloud/certificates#issue-certificates)

## Get started - Namespaces {#create-a-namespace}

If you don't already have a Namespace (or want to create another), see the following:

[Create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/namespaces#create-a-namespace)

## Get started - Invite users {#invite-users}

Adding a user to your Temporal Cloud account includes sending an email invite that the user must then accept.
To add users, see the following:

[How to invite users to your Temporal Cloud account](/cloud/users#invite-users)

## Get started - Connect {#connect-to-temporal-cloud}

Connecting your [Temporal Clients](/temporal#temporal-client) and [Worker Processes](/workers#worker-process) to Temporal Cloud is similar to connecting them to your own [Temporal Cluster](/clusters).
The primary difference is the requirement to provide client certificates and private keys.
