The operating envelope of Temporal Cloud includes availability, regions, throughput, and latency.
If you need more details, [contact us](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us).

## What is Temporal Cloud's SLA on Availability? {#availability}

Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% availability, and its service level agreement (SLA) has a 99.9% guarantee against service errors.

To calculate the service-error rate, we capture all requests that arrive in a region during a five-minute interval and record the number of gRPC service errors that occurred.
For each region, we calculate the service-error rate as `1 - (count of errors / count of requests)`.
Rates are averaged per month and reset quarterly.

Errors that are recorded against the SLA are service errors, such as the `UNAVAILABLE` [gRPC status code](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html).

Errors that aren't counted against the SLA include the following:

- ClientVersionNotSupported
- InvalidArgument
- NamespaceAlreadyExists
- NamespaceInvalidState
- NamespaceNotActive
- NamespaceNotFound
- NotFound
- PermissionDenied
- QueryFailed
- RetryReplication
- ShardOwnershipLost
- StickyWorkerUnavailable
- TaskAlreadyStarted
- Throttling (resources exhausted; triggers retry)
- WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStarted
- WorkflowNotReady

Our internal alerting system is based on our service level objectives (SLO) for all errors, not just errors that count against the SLA.
When we receive an alert that an SLO is not being met, we page our on-call engineers, which often means that issues are resolved before they become noticeable.

Internally, our components are distributed across a minimum of three availability zones per region.

For current system status and information about recent incidents, see [Temporal Status](https://status.temporal.io).

## Where is Temporal Cloud hosted and running? {#regions}

Temporal Cloud currently runs in 10 regions in Amazon Web Services (AWS):

| Area          | Code           | Region            |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Asia Pacific  | ap-northeast-1 | Tokyo             |
| Asia Pacific  | ap-south-1     | Mumbai            |
| Asia Pacific  | ap-southeast-1 | Singapore         |
| Asia Pacific  | ap-southeast-2 | Sydney            |
| Europe        | eu-central-1   | Frankfurt         |
| Europe        | eu-west-1      | Ireland           |
| Europe        | eu-west-2      | London            |
| North America | ca-central-1   | Central Canada    |
| North America | us-east-1      | Northern Virginia |
| North America | us-east-2      | Ohio              |
| North America | us-west-2      | Oregon            |

Furthermore, it is compatible with applications deployed in any cloud environment or data center.

To reduce latency, we recommend that you create your [Namespace](/namespaces#) in a region that is geographically close to where your [Workers](/workers#worker) are hosted, but your Workers and [Client](/temporal#temporal-client) code don't need to be hosted on AWS.

## What kind of throughput can I get with Temporal Cloud? {#throughput}

A Namespace has a default quota of 200 [Actions](/cloud/pricing#action) per second with spikes up to 400 Actions per second.
However, Temporal Cloud can provide more than 150,000 Actions per second.

If your Action rate exceeds your quota, Temporal Cloud throttles Actions until the rate matches your quota.
Actions like Start or Signal Workflow Execution always receive higher priority than other Actions, even when throttled.

To raise your quota, create a [support ticket](/cloud/support#support-ticket).

## What kind of latency can I expect from Temporal Cloud? {#latency}

Temporal Cloud aims for a latency SLO of 200ms per region for p99.
In June 2023, Temporal measured latency over a week-long period for starting and signaling Workflow Executions as follows:

- For `StartWorkflowExecution`: p90 latecy was 90ms, and p99 latency was 125ms.
- For `SignalWorkflowExecution`: p90 latency was 53ms, and p99 latency was 95ms.
- For `SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution`: p90 latency was 87ms, and p99 latency was 116ms.

As Temporal continues working on improving latencies, these numbers will progressively decrease.

Latency observed from the Temporal Client is influenced by other system components like the Codec Server, egress proxy, and the network itself.
Increased latency might result from concurrent operations on the same Workflow Execution.
