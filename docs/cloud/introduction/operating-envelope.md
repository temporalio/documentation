The operating envelope of Temporal Cloud includes availability, regions, throughput, and latency.
If you need more details, [contact us](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us).

## What is Temporal Cloud's SLA on Availability? {#availability}

Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% availability, and its service level agreement (SLA) has a 99.9% guarantee against service errors.

To calculate the service-error rate, we capture all requests that arrive in a region during a five-minute interval and record the number of gRPC service errors that occurred.
For each region, we calculate the service-error rate as `1 - (count of errors / count of requests)`.
Rates are averaged per month and reset quarterly.

Errors that are recorded against the SLA are service errors, such as the `UNAVAILABLE` [gRPC status code](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html).

Errors that aren't counted against the SLA include the following:

- ClientVersionNotSupported
- InvalidArgument
- NamespaceAlreadyExists
- NamespaceInvalidState
- NamespaceNotActive
- NamespaceNotFound
- NotFound
- PermissionDenied
- QueryFailed
- RetryReplication
- ShardOwnershipLost
- StickyWorkerUnavailable
- TaskAlreadyStarted
- Throttling (resources exhausted; triggers retry)
- WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStarted
- WorkflowNotReady

Our internal alerting system is based on our service level objectives (SLO) for all errors, not just errors that count against the SLA.
When we receive an alert that an SLO is not being met, we page our on-call engineers, which often means that issues are resolved before they become noticeable.

Internally, our components are distributed across a minimum of three availability zones per region.

For current system status and information about recent incidents, see [Temporal Status](https://status.temporal.io).

## Where is Temporal Cloud hosted and running? {#regions}

Temporal Cloud currently runs in 10 regions in Amazon Web Services (AWS):

| Code           | Region                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| ap-northeast-1 | Asia Pacific (Tokyo)     |
| ap-southeast-1 | Asia Pacific (Singapore) |
| ap-southeast-2 | Asia Pacific (Sydney)    |
| ca-central-1   | Canada (Central)         |
| eu-central-1   | EU (Frankfurt)           |
| eu-west-1      | EU (Ireland)             |
| eu-west-2      | EU (London)              |
| us-east-1      | US East (N. Virginia)    |
| us-east-2      | US East (Ohio)           |
| us-west-2      | US West (Oregon)         |

Furthermore, it is compatible with applications deployed in any cloud environment or data center.

To reduce latency, we recommend that you create your <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Namespace<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> in a region that is geographically close to where your <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#worker">Workers<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Worker?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In day-to-day conversations, the term Worker is used to denote both a Worker Program and a Worker Process.

## What kind of throughput can I get with Temporal Cloud? {#throughput}

A Namespace has a default quota of 200 <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/introduction/pricing#action">Actions<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Action?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Action is the fundamental pricing unit in Temporal Cloud.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/introduction/pricing#action">Learn more</a></span></span></a> per second with spikes up to 400 Actions per second.
However, Temporal Cloud can provide more than 150,000 Actions per second.

If your Action rate exceeds your quota, Temporal Cloud throttles Actions until the rate matches your quota.
Actions like Start or Signal Workflow Execution always receive higher priority than other Actions, even when throttled.

To raise your quota, create a <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/introduction/support#support-ticket">support ticket<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create a ticket for Temporal Support</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To request assistance from Temporal Support, create a ticket in Zendesk.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/introduction/support#support-ticket">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

## What kind of latency can I expect from Temporal Cloud? {#latency}

Our latency SLO is 200ms per region for p99.
In June 2023, latency measurements over a week period for starting and signaling Workflow Executions were:

- `StartWorkflowExecution`: 90ms p90, 125ms p99
- `SignalWorkflowExecution`: 53ms p90, 95ms p99
- `SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution`: 87ms p90, 116ms p99

As we continue working on improving latencies, these numbers will decrease over time

Concurrent operations on the same Workflow Execution could lead to increased latency.

## Temporal Platform limits sheet {#limits-sheet}

Running into limits can cause unexpected failures.
Knowing Temporal's limits can prevent that.

This section details many of the errors and warnings coded into the Temporal Platform.
Errors are hard limits that fail when reached.
Warnings are soft limits that produce a warning log on the server side.

- **Identifiers**: By default, the maximum length for identifiers (such as Workflow Id, Workflow Type, and Task Queue name) is 1000 characters.
  - This is configurable with the `limit.maxIDLength` dynamic config variable, set to 255 in [this SQL example](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose/blob/93d382ef9133e4cde8ce311de5153cd0cc9fbd0c/dynamicconfig/development-sql.yaml#L1-L2).
  - The character format is UTF-8.
- **gRPC**: gRPC has a limit of 4 MB for [each message received](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/v1.36.2/include/grpc/impl/codegen/grpc_types.h#L466).
- **Event batch size**: The `DefaultTransactionSizeLimit` limit is [4 MB](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/1363).
  This is the largest transaction size allowed for the persistence of Event Histories.
- **Blob size limit** for Payloads (including Workflow context and each Workflow and Activity argument and return value; _[source](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/frontend/service.go#L133-L134)_):
  - Temporal warns at 256 KB: [Blob size exceeds limit.](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/fee1c43823699e90b330680a8efeb9d8dbee8cf3/common/util.go#L568)
  - Temporal errors at 2 MB: `ErrBlobSizeExceedsLimit: Blob data size exceeds limit.`
  - This is configurable with [BlobSizeLimitError and BlobSizeLimitWarn](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L378-L379), if you know what you are doing.
- **History total size limit** (leading to a terminated Workflow Execution):
  - Temporal warns at 10 MB: `history size exceeds warn limit`.
  - Temporal errors at 50 MB: [history size exceeds error limit](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/workflowExecutionContext.go#L1204).
  - This is configurable with [HistorySizeLimitError and HistorySizeLimitWarn](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L380-L381), if you know what you are doing.
- **History total count limit** (leading to a terminated Workflow Execution):
  - Temporal warns after 10,240 Events: `history size exceeds warn limit`.
  - Temporal errors after 51,200 Events: [history size exceeds error limit](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/workflowExecutionContext.go#L1204).
  - This is configurable with [HistoryCountLimitError and HistoryCountLimitWarn](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L382-L383), if you know what you are doing.
- **Concurrent Action limit**
  - We fail the following action Commands on Temporal Cloud if the concurrent running count exceeds 2,000:
    - `ScheduleActivityTask`
    - `SignalExternalWorkflowExecution`
    - `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution`
    - `StartChildWorkflowExecution`
  - As of v1.21, the open source Temporal Cluster has a default limit of 2,000 pending Activities, Child Workflows, Signals, or Workflow cancellation requests, but you can override the limits in the dynamic configuration using these variables:
    - `limit.numPendingActivities.error`
    - `limit.numPendingSignals.error`
    - `limit.numPendingCancelRequests.error`
    - `limit.numPendingChildExecutions.error`
- [Custom Search Attributes limits](/visibility/#custom-search-attributes-limits)

## Default limits for Temporal Cloud {#default-limits}

Temporal Cloud sets default limits for [Account level](#account-level), [Namespace level](#namespace-level), and [List Filters](#list-filters).

#### Account level

The following limits are applied to the entire account:

- Users: 100
- Namespaces: 10
- Prometheus endpoint Retention Period: 1 month

#### Namespace level

The following limits are applied to each Namespace:

- <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/introduction/pricing#action">Actions<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Action?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Action is the fundamental pricing unit in Temporal Cloud.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/introduction/pricing#action">Learn more</a></span></span></a> per second: 200 (with spikes to 400)
- Certificates: 32-KB payload or 16 certificates, whichever is smaller
- Concurrent Task pollers: 2,000 (configurable; maximum of 100,000)
- Custom Search Attributes (maximum per type)
  - bool: 20
  - double: 20
  - datetime: 20
  - int: 20
  - keyword: 20
  - text: 5
- Retention Period: 30 days (configurable; range of 1—90 days)
- Number of Signals received per Workflow Execution: 10,000

#### List Filters

The **ORDER BY** operator isn't supported in List Filters in Temporal Cloud.
This means that you can't apply custom ordering of Workflows with Cloud Visibility features.
Lists of Workflows are still ordered by a default ordering rule.
Be aware that this rule might change.

#### Increasing limits

Some of the default Temporal Cloud limits can be increased by [submitting a support ticket](/cloud/introduction/support#support-ticket).

The default values are intended to guard against unintentional resource usage.
