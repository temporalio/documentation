The operating envelope of Temporal Cloud includes availability, regions, throughput, and latency.
If you need more details, [contact us](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us).

## What is Temporal Cloud's SLA on Availability? {#availability}

Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% availability, and its service level agreement (SLA) has a 99.9% guarantee against service errors.

To calculate the service-error rate, we capture all requests that arrive in a region during a five-minute interval and record the number of gRPC service errors that occurred.
For each region, we calculate the service-error rate as `1 - (count of errors / count of requests)`.
Rates are averaged per month and reset quarterly.

Errors that are recorded against the SLA are service errors, such as the `UNAVAILABLE` [gRPC status code](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html).

Errors that aren't counted against the SLA include the following:

- ClientVersionNotSupported
- InvalidArgument
- NamespaceAlreadyExists
- NamespaceInvalidState
- NamespaceNotActive
- NamespaceNotFound
- NotFound
- PermissionDenied
- QueryFailed
- RetryReplication
- ShardOwnershipLost
- StickyWorkerUnavailable
- TaskAlreadyStarted
- Throttling (resources exhausted; triggers retry)
- WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStarted
- WorkflowNotReady

Our internal alerting system is based on our service level objectives (SLO) for all errors, not just errors that count against the SLA.
When we receive an alert that an SLO is not being met, we page our on-call engineers, which often means that issues are resolved before they become noticeable.

Internally, our components are distributed across a minimum of three availability zones per region.

For current system status and information about recent incidents, see [Temporal Status](https://status.temporal.io).

## Where is Temporal Cloud hosted and running? {#regions}

Temporal Cloud currently runs in 10 regions in Amazon Web Services (AWS):

| Code           | Region                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| ap-northeast-1 | Asia Pacific (Tokyo)     |
| ap-southeast-1 | Asia Pacific (Singapore) |
| ap-southeast-2 | Asia Pacific (Sydney)    |
| ca-central-1   | Canada (Central)         |
| eu-central-1   | EU (Frankfurt)           |
| eu-west-1      | EU (Ireland)             |
| eu-west-2      | EU (London)              |
| us-east-1      | US East (N. Virginia)    |
| us-east-2      | US East (Ohio)           |
| us-west-2      | US West (Oregon)         |

Furthermore, it is compatible with applications deployed in any cloud environment or data center.

To reduce latency, we recommend that you create your <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Namespace<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> in a region that is geographically close to where your <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#worker">Workers<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Worker?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In day-to-day conversations, the term Worker is used to denote both a Worker Program and a Worker Process.

## What kind of throughput can I get with Temporal Cloud? {#throughput}

A Namespace has a default quota of 200 <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/introduction/pricing#action">Actions<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Action?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Action is the fundamental pricing unit in Temporal Cloud.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/introduction/pricing#action">Learn more</a></span></span></a> per second with spikes up to 400 Actions per second.
However, Temporal Cloud can provide more than 150,000 Actions per second.

If your Action rate exceeds your quota, Temporal Cloud throttles Actions until the rate matches your quota.
Actions like Start or Signal Workflow Execution always receive higher priority than other Actions, even when throttled.

To raise your quota, create a <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/introduction/support#support-ticket">support ticket<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create a ticket for Temporal Support</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To request assistance from Temporal Support, create a ticket in Zendesk.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/introduction/support#support-ticket">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

## What kind of latency can I expect from Temporal Cloud? {#latency}

Our latency SLO is 200ms per region for p99.
In June 2023, latency measurements over a week period for starting and signaling Workflow Executions were:

- `StartWorkflowExecution`: 90ms p90, 125ms p99
- `SignalWorkflowExecution`: 53ms p90, 95ms p99
- `SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution`: 87ms p90, 116ms p99

As we continue working on improving latencies, these numbers will decrease over time

Concurrent operations on the same Workflow Execution could lead to increased latency.
