## What are the services offered by Temporal Cloud? {#services}

We offer four services to Temporal Cloud customers. For access to any of these services, please [create a support ticket](/cloud/support) or contact your dedicated account manager.

- **Technical onboarding:** Every Temporal Cloud customer is offered a dedicated onboarding session led by a Developer Success Engineer.
  This session covers basic setup and Namespace planning and provides an overview of metrics and observability, an overview of development resources, and information you will need in preparation for your go-live.
- **Design and code reviews:** Our team works with you to review your Workflow design and code to avoid potential issues and optimize your workload to run on Temporal Cloud.
  These sessions also focus on the optimization of your Workflow Actions and reduce your costs; they also reveal likely trade offs.
- **Pre-production optimization:** We offer a dedicated session covering everything from identifying and troubleshooting the most common issues to observability setup, critical metrics to watch, and application design assistance.
- **Load tests:** Our Developer Success team walks through the basics of scaling Workers and metrics.
  We also watch as tests are performed to ensure you have appropriate capacity to complete those tests.
