<!--- Onboarding guide for Temporal Cloud --->

You received email from Temporal that welcomes you to your new Temporal account.
Your email address is now the first [Global Admin](/cloud/#account-level-roles) for your account.

To get started with Temporal Cloud, follow these onboarding steps:

<!--- 1. [Create an account.](#create-an-account-in-temporal-cloud) --->

1. [Issue CA certificates](#issue-ca-certificates).
1. [Create a Namespace](#create-a-namespace).
1. [Invite users](#invite-users).
1. [Connect to Temporal Cloud](#connect-to-temporal-cloud).

## Issue CA certificates

You must provide your own certificates to access Temporal Cloud.
For certificate requirements, see the following:

- [Requirements for CA certificates](/cloud/how-to-manage-certificates-in-temporal-cloud#certificate-requirements)
- [Issue root CA and end-entity certificates](/cloud/how-to-manage-certificates-in-temporal-cloud#issue-certificates)

## Create a Namespace

If you don't already have a Namespace (or want to create another), see the following:

[Create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud/#create-a-namespace-in-temporal-cloud)

## Invite users

:::caution

Access to Temporal Cloud is authorized via single sign-on (SSO), currently limited to Google OAuth.
The email addresses of all users who need access to Temporal Cloud must be registered with Google.

If an email address is not associated with a Google Account, the user must follow the instructions in the [Use an existing email address](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en#existingemail) section of [Create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441).

**Important:** Do _not_ create a Gmail account when creating a Google Account.

:::

When you create a user in Temporal Cloud, the prospective user receives an email invitation.
Before accepting the invitation, the user must be logged in to Google using the email address that received the invitation.
The user must then click **Accept Invite** in the message.
Attempting to log in to Temporal Cloud without first accepting the invite doesn't work.

### Roles and permissions

Each user in Temporal Cloud is assigned a Role.
Each user can be assigned permissions for individual Namespaces.

- [Account-level Roles](/cloud/#account-level-roles)
- [Namespace-level permissions](/cloud/#namespace-level-permissions)
