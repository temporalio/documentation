Access to Temporal Cloud is governed by role-based access control (RBAC). Within an account, each access principal, such
as user, user group or service account, is assigned one or more account-level roles, and each role has a set of
permissions. Each principal can only perform an action if they have a role that grants them the necessary permissions.

Within a Namespace, each principal is assigned one or more Namespace-level permissions, and each permission permits a
set of actions. Each principal can only perform an action if they have a permission that grants them the necessary
actions within the Namespace.

Temporal Cloud supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)
for integration with your organization's identity provider (IDP). SAML enables single sign-on (SSO) by allowing your
identity provider to authenticate users into Temporal Cloud. SCIM automatically creates, updates, and removes users and
groups in Temporal Cloud based on changes in your identity provider.

## Temporal Cloud accounts

Accounts are the top-level container for access control. Each account has at least one user assigned the Account Owner
role, which has full administrative permissions across the account, including users, billing and usage. An account is
**not** an access principal itself.

When you sign up for Temporal Cloud without joining an existing account, you are automatically assigned the Account
Owner role for a new account. You can then invite other users to join the account and assign them roles.

Multiple accounts can coexist on the same email domain. Each account can have its own independent SAML configuration,
tied to its unique Account ID.

However, each email address can only be associated with a single Temporal Cloud account. If you need access to multiple
accounts, you’ll need a separate invite for each one using a different email address.

## Access principals

Temporal Cloud offers the following principals for access control:

- [**Users**](/cloud/users) - Manage individual user accounts and permissions
- [**User Groups**](/cloud/user-groups) - Organize users into groups for simplified access management
- [**Service Accounts**](/cloud/service-accounts) - Configure service accounts for automated access

These principals can assume [account-level roles](/cloud/manage-access/roles-and-permissions#account-level-roles) and be
granted [Namespace-level permissions](/cloud/manage-access/roles-and-permissions#namespace-level-permissions) to perform
actions within the account and a Namespace, respectively.

## Roles and permissions

Temporal Cloud' RBAC model works in a hierarchical manner. Account-level roles grant permissions to perform actions
within the account, and Namespace-level permissions grant permissions to perform actions within a Namespace. Refer to
the [Roles and permissions](/cloud/manage-access/roles-and-permissions) page for more details.

## Integration with identity providers

Temporal Cloud supports SAML and SCIM for integration with your organization's identity provider (IDP).

- [**SAML**](/cloud/saml) - Configure SAML-based SSO integration
- [**SCIM**](/cloud/scim) - Use your IDP to manage Temporal Cloud users and access via SCIM integration

## Troubleshoot account access issues

### Recover your account after losing access to your authenticator app {#mfa-recovery}

Accounts registered with email and password require multi-factor authentication (MFA) with an authenticator app. If you
lose access to your authenticator app, you can still log in by clicking **Try another method** on the MFA screen. From
there, you can either:

- Enter your recovery code (provided when you first set up MFA)
- Receive a verification code through email

Once you're logged in, you can reset your authenticator app by navigating to **My Profile** > **Password and
Authentication** and then clicking **Authenticator App** > **Remove method**.

### Reset your password {#reset-password}

If you're currently logged in and would like to change your password, click your profile icon at the top right of the
Temporal Cloud UI, navigate to **My Profile** > **Password and Authentication**, and then click **Reset Password**.

If you're not currently logged in, navigate to the login page of the Temporal Cloud UI, enter your email address, click
**Continue**, and then select **Forgot password**. In both cases, you will receive an email with instructions on how to
reset your password.

### Sign in after email domain changes {#email-domain-change}

If your organization changed its email domain (for example, from `@oldcompany.com` to `@newcompany.com`), you may be
unable to sign in to Temporal Cloud with your existing account.

**Why this happens:** When you sign in using "Continue with Google" or "Continue with Microsoft", Temporal Cloud
identifies your account by your email address. If your email address changes, Temporal Cloud sees this as a different
identity and cannot match it to your existing account.

**How to resolve this:** [Create a support ticket](/cloud/support#support-ticket) with the following information:

- Your previous email address (the one originally used to access Temporal Cloud)
- Your new email address
- Your Temporal Cloud Account Id (if known)

Temporal Support can update your account to use your new email address.

:::tip Use SAML for enterprise identity management

If your organization frequently changes email domains or wants centralized control over user authentication, consider
using [SAML authentication](/cloud/saml). With SAML, your identity provider (IdP) manages user identities, and email
domain changes can be handled within your IdP without affecting Temporal Cloud access.
