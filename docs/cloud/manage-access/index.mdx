Access to Temporal Cloud is governed by role-based access control (RBAC). Within an account, each access principal, such
as user, user group or service account, is assigned one or more account-level roles, and each role has a set of
permissions. Each principal can only perform an action if they have a role that grants them the necessary permissions.

Within a Namespace, each principal is assigned one or more Namespace-level permissions, and each permission permits a
set of actions. Each principal can only perform an action if they have a permission that grants them the necessary
actions within the Namespace.

Temporal Cloud supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)
for integration with your organization's identity provider (IDP). SAML enables single sign-on (SSO) by allowing your
identity provider to authenticate users into Temporal Cloud. SCIM automatically creates, updates, and removes users and
groups in Temporal Cloud based on changes in your identity provider.

## Temporal Cloud accounts

Accounts are the top-level container for access control. Each account has at least one user assigned the Account Owner
role, which has full administrative permissions across the account, including users, billing and usage. An account is
**not** an access principal itself.

When you sign up for Temporal Cloud without joining an existing account, you are automatically assigned the Account
Owner role for a new account. You can then invite other users to join the account and assign them roles.

## Access principals

Temporal Cloud offers the following principals for access control:

- [**Users**](/cloud/users) - Manage individual user accounts and permissions
- [**User Groups**](/cloud/user-groups) - Organize users into groups for simplified access management
- [**Service Accounts**](/cloud/service-accounts) - Configure service accounts for automated access

## Integration with identity providers

- [**SAML**](/cloud/saml) - Configure SAML-based SSO integration
- [**SCIM**](/cloud/scim) - Use your IDP to manage Temporal Cloud users and access via SCIM integration
