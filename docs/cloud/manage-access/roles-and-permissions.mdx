Temporal Cloud uses role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to resources. Access is governed both on the
account-level and within a Namespace. On the account-level, each access principal is assigned one account-level role. On
the Namespace-level, each access principal can be assigned one Namespace-level permission. Some account-level roles,
such as Account Owner and Global Admin, automatically have Namespace Admin permissions on all Namespaces in the account.

## Account-level roles

Account-level roles are assigned to access principals at the account level. They control access to account resources,
such as:

- Users and Service Accounts
- Billing and usage
- Namespaces. This includes creating and managing Namespaces only, not access to resources within a Namespace, which is
  controlled by [Namespace-level permissions](#namespace-level-permissions).
- Nexus Endpoints

The following table provides a summary of the account-level roles and their primary purpose:

| Role          | Primary purpose                             | Can create Namespaces | Automatic Namespace Admin               | Billing and usage access          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Account Owner | Owns and governs the account                | Yes                   | All Namespaces (cannot be revoked)      | Full billing, payments, and usage |
| Global Admin  | Administers account configuration and users | Yes                   | All Namespaces (cannot be revoked)      | Usage only                        |
| Developer     | Creates and manages Namespaces they own     | Yes                   | Namespaces they create (can be revoked) | None                              |
| Finance Admin | Manages billing and payment information     | No                    | None                                    | Full billing and payments         |
| Read-Only     | Views account configuration and resources   | No                    | None                                    | None                              |

Account-level roles don't govern day-to-day operations within a Namespace. Access to resources inside a Namespace, such
as Workflows and Workflow Executions, is controlled by [Namespace-level permissions](#namespace-level-permissions).

Account Owner and Global Admin roles automatically have Namespace Admin permissions on all Namespaces in the account,
and these permissions cannot be revoked without removing the role. Developers can create Namespaces, and have Namespace
Admin permissions for each Namespace they create. This permission can be revoked. Developer roles also don't have
automatic access to Namespaces that they didn't create.

### Best practice for assigning the Account Owner role

The Account Owner role holds the highest level of access in the system. This role configures account-level parameters
and manages Temporal billing and payment information. It allows users to perform all actions within the Temporal Cloud
account.

We strongly recommend the following precautions when assigning the Account Owner role to users:

- Assign the role to at least two users in your organization. Otherwise, limit the number of users with this role.
- Associate a person’s direct email address to the Account Owner, rather than a shared or generic address, so Temporal
  Support can contact the right person in urgent situations.

This latter rule is useful for anyone on your team who may need to be contacted urgently, regardless of their Account
role.

## Namespace-level permissions {#namespace-level-permissions}

Namespace-level permissions govern access to resources within a Namespace, such as the following:

- Workflows
- Workflow Executions
- Task Queues
- Activity Executions
- Search Attributes
- History
- Events

Namespace-level permissions are assigned to access principals within a Namespace. Each permission has a set of actions
that grant access to specific resources within the Namespace.

The following table provides a summary of the Namespace-level permissions and their primary purpose:

| Permission level | Intended use                      | Human access                                                                                 | Worker runtime access                                     | Namespace administration                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read             | Observe Namespace activity        | View Workflows, Workflow Executions, Schedules, Task Queues, and metadata                    | None                                                      | None                                                                                                      |
| Write            | Operate Workflows and run Workers | Start, signal, cancel, terminate, and reset Workflows; manage Schedules and batch operations | Poll Task Queues and complete Workflow and Activity Tasks | None                                                                                                      |
| Namespace Admin  | Administer the Namespace          | All Read and Write capabilities                                                              | All Read and Write capabilities                           | Update Namespace settings, manage Search Attributes, Export Sinks, replication, and Namespace user access |

You can grant Namespace Admin, Write, or Read-Only permissions to principals with the account-level roles of Developer,
Finance Admin, or Read-Only. Account Owners and Global Admins already have Namespace Admin permissions on all Namespaces
in the account and do not need to be manually assigned Namespace-level permissions.
