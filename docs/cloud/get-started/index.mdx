Getting started with Temporal Cloud involves a few key steps:

1. [Sign up for Temporal Cloud](#sign-up-for-temporal-cloud)
1. [Create a Namespace](#create-a-namespace)
1. [Set up your Clients and Workers](#set-up-your-clients-and-workers)
1. [Run your first Workflow](#run-your-first-workflow)
1. [Invite your team](#invite-your-team)

## Sign up for Temporal Cloud

To create a Temporal Cloud account, you can:

- Sign up [directly](https://temporal.io/get-cloud); or
- Subscribe at the AWS Marketplace for
  [Temporal Cloud Pay-As-You-Go](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-xx2x66m6fp2lo). Signing up through the
  AWS Marketplace is similar to signing up directly on the Temporal Cloud site, but billing goes through your AWS
  account.
- To purchase Temporal Cloud on the Google Cloud Marketplace, please contact our team at sales@temporal.io.

For information about Temporal Cloud Pricing, see our [Pricing Page](/cloud/pricing).

## Create a Namespace

See [Managing Namespaces](/cloud/namespaces#create-a-namespace) to create your first namespace.

Temporal Cloud supports either [API key](/cloud/api-keys) or [mTLS](/cloud/certificates) authentication for each
namespace. If you're not sure which to use, we recommend using [API keys](/cloud/api-keys) because they're easier to
manage and rotate for most teams. If your organization already has private key infrastructure (PKI) and is familiar with
cert management, then [mTLS](/cloud/certificates) is an excellent choice.
