## What is a Cloud Namespace Name? {#temporal-cloud-namespace-name}

A Cloud Namespace Name is a customer-supplied name for a [Namespace](/namespaces) in Temporal Cloud. Each Namespace
Name, such as `accounting-production`, is unique within the scope of a customer's account. It cannot be changed after
the Namespace is provisioned.

Each Namespace Name must conform to the following rules:

- A Namespace Name must contain at least 2 characters and no more than 39 characters.
- A Namespace Name must begin with a letter, end with a letter or number, and contain only letters, numbers, and the
  hyphen (-) character.
- Each hyphen (-) character must be immediately preceded _and_ followed by a letter or number; consecutive hyphens are
  not permitted.
- All letters in a Namespace Name must be lowercase.

## What is a Temporal Cloud Account ID? {#temporal-cloud-account-id}

A Temporal Cloud Account ID is a unique customer identifier assigned by Temporal Technologies. Each Id is a short string
of numbers and letters like `f45a2`, at least five characters long. This account identifier is retained throughout the
time each customer uses Temporal Cloud.

At times you may need to know your customer Account ID. Accessing the account's Namespaces provides an easy way to
capture this information. Each Temporal Namespace use an Account ID suffix. This is the alphanumeric character string
found after the period in any Temporal Cloud Namespace name.

You can retrieve an Account ID from the [Temporal Cloud](https://cloud.temporal.io) Web UI or by using the `tcld`
utility at a command line interface (CLI). Follow these steps.

<Tabs>

    <TabItem value="webui" label="Web UI">
    Follow these steps to retrieve your Account ID:

    1. Log into Temporal Cloud.
    1. Select your account avatar at the top right of the page.
       A profile dropdown menu appears.
    1. Copy the Cloud Account ID from the menu.
       <ZoomingImage
           src="/img/cloud/cloud-guide/cloud-account-id.png"
           alt="Temporal Cloud user profile dropdown menu. The dropdown includes a Cloud Account ID and copy button, with role, profile and logout options, and links to community resources."
       />

    In this example, the Account ID is `123de`.

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="tcldcli" label="tcld">
    1. Use the `tcld` utility to log into an account.

       ```
       tcld login
       ```

       The `tcld` output presents a URL with an activation code at the end. Take note of this code. The utility blocks until the login/activation process completes.

       ```
       Login via this url: https://login.tmprl.cloud/activate?user_code=KTGC-ZPWQ
       ```

       A Web page automatically opens for authentication in your default browser.

    1. Visit the browser.
       Ensure the user code shown by the CLI utility matches the code shown in the Web browser.
       Then, click Confirm in the browser to continue.
       After confirmation, Web feedback lets you know that the CLI "device" is now connected.

    1. Return to the command line.
       Issue the following command.

       ```
       tcld namespace list
       ```

       The CLI tool returns a short JSON packet with your namespace information.
       This is the same list found in the Temporal Cloud Web UI Namespaces list.
       Like the browser version, each Namespace uses an Account ID suffix.

       ```
       {
         "namespaces": [
           "your-namespace.123de",
           "another-namespace.123de"
         ],
         "nextPageToken": ""
       }
       ```

    Each Namespace automatically appends an Account ID suffix to its customer-supplied identifier.
    This five-character-or-longer string appears after the name, separated by a period.
    In this Namespace listing sample, the Account ID is 123de.

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## What is a Cloud Namespace ID? {#temporal-cloud-namespace-id}

A Cloud Namespace ID is a globally unique identifier for a [Namespace](/namespaces) in Temporal Cloud. A Namespace ID is
formed by concatenating the following:

1. A [Namespace Name](#temporal-cloud-namespace-name)
1. A period (.)
1. The [Account ID](#temporal-cloud-account-id) to which the Namespace belongs

For example, for the Account ID `123de` and Namespace Name `accounting-production`, the Namespace ID is
`accounting-production.123de`.

## What is a Cloud gRPC Endpoint? {#temporal-cloud-grpc-endpoint}

Temporal Clients communicate between application code and a Temporal Server by sending and receiving messages via the
gRPC protocol. gRPC is a Remote Procedure Call framework featuring low latency and high performance. gRPC provides
Temporal with an efficient, language-agnostic communication framework.

Every Temporal Namespace uses a gRPC endpoint for communication. When migrating to Temporal Cloud, you'll need to switch
the gRPC endpoint in your code from your current hosting, whether self-hosted or locally-hosted, to Temporal Cloud.

A gRPC endpoint appears on the detail page for each Cloud Namespace. Follow these steps to find it:

1. Log into your account on [cloud.temporal.io](https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces).
2. Navigate to the Namespace list page from the left-side vertical navigation.
3. Tap or click on the Namespace Name to select and open the page for the Namespace whose endpoint you want to retrieve.
4. On the Namespace detail page, click on the "Connect" button in the top right corner of the page.
5. If multiple endpoints are displayed, choose which [type of endpoint](/cloud/namespaces/#access-namespaces) best fits your use case.
6. Click the copy icon next to the gRPC address to copy it to your clipboard.

See [How to access a Namespace in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/namespaces/#access-namespaces) for more information on
different gRPC endpoint types and how to access them.

## How to create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud {#create-a-namespace}

:::info

The user who creates a [Namespace](/namespaces) is automatically granted
[Namespace Admin](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions) permission for that Namespace.

To create a Namespace, a user must have the Developer, Account Owner, or Global Admin account-level
[Role](/cloud/users#account-level-roles).

:::

:::tip

By default, each account is allocated with a limit of ten Namespaces. As you start using Namespaces by scheduling
Workflows, Temporal Cloud automatically raises your allowance. This automatic adjustment happens whenever all your
Namespaces are in use, up to a maximum of 100 Namespaces. You can request further increases beyond the 100 Namespace
limit by opening a [support ticket](/cloud/support#support-ticket).

:::

### Information needed to create a Namespace

To create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud, gather the following information:

- [Namespace Name](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-namespace-name), region, and Cloud Provider
- [Retention Period](/temporal-service/temporal-server#retention-period) for the
  [Event History](/workflow-execution/event#event-history) of closed [Workflow Executions](/workflow-execution).
- [CA certificate](/cloud/certificates#certificate-requirements) for the Namespace, if you are using mTLS
  authentication.
- [Codec Server endpoint](/production-deployment/data-encryption#set-your-codec-server-endpoints-with-web-ui-and-cli) to
  show decoded payloads to users in the Event History for Workflow Executions in the Namespace. For details, see
  [Securing your data](/production-deployment/data-encryption).
- [Permissions](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions) for each user.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="namespace-webui" label="Web UI">

### Create a Namespace using Temporal Cloud UI

1. Gather the information listed earlier in
   [Information needed to create a Namespace](#information-needed-to-create-a-namespace).
1. Go to the Temporal Cloud UI and log in.
1. On the left side of the window, click **Namespaces**.
1. On the **Namespaces** page, click **Create Namespace** in the upper-right portion of the window.
1. On the **Create Namespace** page in **Name**, enter the Namespace Name.
1. In **Cloud Provider**, select the cloud provider in which to host this Namespace.
1. In **Region**, select the region in which to host this Namespace.
1. In **Retention Period**, specify a value from 1 to 90 days. When choosing this value, consider your needs for Event
   History versus the cost of maintaining that Event History. Typically, a development Namespace has a short retention
   period and a production Namespace has a longer retention period. (If you need to change this value later, contact
   [Temporal Support](/cloud/support#support-ticket).)
1. Select your authentication method: [API keys](/cloud/api-keys) or [mTLS](/cloud/certificates).
1. If using mTLS authentication, paste the CA certificate for this Namespace.
1. Optional: In **Codec Server**, enter the HTTPS URL (including the port number) of your Codec Server endpoint. You may
   also enable "Pass the user access token with your endpoint" and "Include cross-origin credentials." For details, see
   [Hosting your Codec Server](/production-deployment/data-encryption#set-your-codec-server-endpoints-with-web-ui-and-cli).
1. Click **Create Namespace**.

## What are some Namespace best practices? {#best-practices}

See [Namespace Best Practices](/best-practices/managing-namespace) for an overview of:

- naming conventions
- typical organizational patterns
- safeguards for production
- tagging

## How to call Workflows from different Namespaces?

Temporal Applications in different Namespaces may be connected with [Nexus](/cloud/nexus) by exposing a clean service
contract for others to use with built-in [Nexus access controls](/cloud/nexus/security). Nexus supports cross-team,
cross-domain, multi-region, and multi-cloud use cases.

## Namespace Constraints and Limitations {#limits}

Temporal Cloud Namespaces operate under the following constraints:

- By default, each account is allocated with a limit of ten Namespaces. As you create and use your Namespaces, for
  example by scheduling Workflows, Temporal Cloud automatically raises your limit. Our service identifies your usage
  patterns. It responds by slowly increasing your allowance, up to 100 Namespaces. You can request further increases
  beyond the 100 Namespace limit by opening a [support ticket](/cloud/support#support-ticket).
- Each Namespace has [rate limits](/cloud/limits#namespace-level) for actions, operations, schedules, requests, and visibility requests.
  A namespace may be rate limited when its throughput becomes too high to prevent overloading the system.
  Namespace limits automatically adjust based on the prior 7 days of usage.
- By default, Namespaces have a [service-level agreement (SLA)](/cloud/sla) of 99.9% availability against service errors.
- You can opt-in to using [High Availability features](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/high-availability) to increase the 
  SLA to 99.99%.
  - Note: If a Namespace's [action per second limit](/cloud/limits#actions-per-second) has been raised above the default, 
    then it will require a support ticket to enable High Availability.
    Support will ensure that Temporal Cloud has capacity to handle the additional APS before it adds the replica.
- A Namespace is a security isolation boundary. Access to Temporal by [Worker Processes](/workers#worker-process) is
  permitted at the Namespace level. Isolating applications or environments (development, test, staging, production)
  should take this into consideration. See the [best practices for organizing Namespaces](/best-practices/managing-namespace)
- A Namespace is provisioned with [endpoints](constraints-and-limitations) for executing your Workflows. Accessing a Namespace from a Worker or Temporal Client
  requires [API keys](/cloud/api-keys) or [mTLS](/cloud/certificates) authentication.
- Every open Workflow in a Namespace needs a unique [Workflow ID](/workflow-execution/workflowid-runid#workflow-id).
  This does not apply to closed Workflows, which may have the same Workflow ID in the same Namespace.
  Open Workflows in different Namespaces may have the same Workflow ID.
- [Task Queue](/task-queue) names are unique per Namespace.
- Closed Workflow retention is per Namespace.
- RBAC [permissions](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions) are implemented at the Namespace level.
- For Workflows in different Namespaces to communicate with each other, they must use Nexus.

## How to access a Namespace in Temporal Cloud {#access-namespaces}

{/* How to access a Namespace in Temporal Cloud */}

Temporal Cloud supports authentication to Namespaces using [API keys](/cloud/api-keys) _or_
[mTLS](/cloud/certificates). To migrate a Namespace from one authentication method to another, or to use both API
key and mTLS authentication on the same Namespace, please contact
[Support](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/support#support-ticket).

:::info

Using both API key and mTLS authentication on the same Namespace is in
[pre-release](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages) and cannot be used along with
[High Availability features](/cloud/high-availability).

:::

Connecting to your Namespace requires a specific endpoint that works for the given Namespace.
There are two types of gRPC endpoints for accessing a Namespace in Temporal Cloud: a Namespace endpoint and a regional endpoint.

- Namespace endpoint (`<namespace>.<account>.tmprl.cloud:7233`)
    - Benefits:
        - This endpoint is unique to each Namespace. It will always connect to the Namespace, no matter which region(s) the Namespace is using. (Recommended for Namespaces with High Availability)
        - A Temporal Client that uses a Namespace endpoint doesn't have to be aware of which region the Namespace is in.
    - Restrictions:
        - If [High Availability](/cloud/high-availability) is not enabled, then accessing a Namespace via API key + Namespace endpoint is not supported. To use the Namespace endpoint with API keys, a Namespace must have [High Availability](/cloud/high-availability) enabled.
- Regional endpoint (`<region>.<cloud_provider>.api.temporal.io:7233`)
    - Benefits:
        - Temporal Cloud has only one regional endpoint for each cloud region. The same regional endpoint can access any Namespace that is active in that region (or that has a [replica](/cloud/high-availability) in that region).
        - A Temporal Client can use a regional endpoint to ensure connection to a Namespace always happens within that region.
    - Restrictions:
        - When using mTLS to authenticate, the Temporal Client override the Server Name Indication (SNI) in the TLS configuration with the value of the Namespace endpoint.
          In the Temporal SDKs, this can be done using the "TLS Server Name" property in requests to Temporal Cloud.
          For example, in the [Temporal CLI](/cloud/certificates#configure-temporal-cli, this can be done by using `TEMPORAL_TLS_SERVER_NAME=<namespace endpoint>` or `--tls-server-name <namespace endpoint>`.

This table summarizes which endpoints are available for a Namespace based on which features the Namespace has enabled:

|                            | Not High Availability                                                 | High Availability                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **mTLS Authentication**    | Namespace endpoint or regional endpoint (must override `server_name`) | Namespace endpoint (recommended) or regional endpoint (must override `server_name`) |
| **API Key Authentication** | Regional endpoint only                                                | Namespace endpoint (recommended) or regional endpoint                               |

:::info

When switching on or off High Availability features for a Namespace, you may need to update the gRPC endpoint used by
Temporal Clients and Workers. See [Disable High Availability](/cloud/high-availability/enable#disable) for more information.

:::

### Authenticating with API keys or mTLS

To use API keys with [supported SDKs](/cloud/api-keys#api-key-supported-tooling), see
  [Use API keys to authenticate](/cloud/api-keys#using-apikeys).
  
To use mTLS to connect with the [Temporal CLI](/cli) and [Client SDK](/develop), see
  [Configure Clients to use Client certificates](/cloud/certificates#configure-clients-to-use-client-certificates).

### Accessing the Temporal Web UI

For accessing the Temporal Web UI, use the HTTPS endpoint in the form:
`https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces/<namespace>.<account>`. For example:
`https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces/accounting-production.f45a2`.

### Accessing Namespaces with Encryption and Private Connectivity

To ensure the security of your data, all traffic to and from your Namespace is encrypted with TLS 1.3. 

For enhanced protection:

- Set up [private connectivity](/cloud/connectivity#private-network-connectivity-for-namespaces) to the Namespace.
- When not using private connectivity, always connect to a Namespace from the same cloud provider.
  If the Namespace is on AWS, then only connect to it from Workers that are also on AWS.
  This keeps all traffic between Workers and Temporal Cloud on the cloud's backbone (see [AWS docs](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#:~:text=the%20Internet%20gateway.-,Q.,AWS%20use%20AWS's%20private%20network.), [GCP docs](https://cloud.google.com/network-tiers/docs/overview))
- In your own networking architecture, set up an allow list for outgoing network requests from your Clients and Workers with the IP address ranges of the
  Cloud Provider region(s) in which your Namespace is located:
  - [AWS IP address ranges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ip-ranges.html)
  - [GCP IP address ranges](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/faq#find_ip_range)

## How to manage Namespaces in Temporal Cloud {#manage-namespaces}

{/* How to manage Namespaces in Temporal Cloud using Temporal Cloud UI */}

### Manage Namespaces in Temporal Cloud using Temporal Cloud UI

To list Namespaces:

- On the left side of the window, select **Namespaces**.

To edit a Namespace (including custom Search Attributes, certificates, certificate filters, Codec Server endpoint,
permissions, and users), find the Namespace and do either of the following:

- On the right end of the Namespace row, select the three vertical dots (⋮). Click **Edit**.
- Select the Namespace name. In the top-right portion of the page, select **Edit**.

On the **Edit** page, you can do the following:

- Add a [custom Search Attribute](/search-attribute#custom-search-attribute).
- [Manage CA certificates](/cloud/certificates).
- [Manage certificate filters](/cloud/certificates#manage-certificate-filters-using-temporal-cloud-ui).
- Set
  [Codec Server endpoint](/production-deployment/data-encryption#set-your-codec-server-endpoints-with-web-ui-and-cli)
  for all users on the Namespace. Each user on the Namespace has the option to
  [override this setting](/production-deployment/data-encryption#web-ui) in their browser.
- Manage [Namespace-level permissions](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions).
- Add users.

To add a user to a Namespace, scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Add User**.

After you make changes, select **Save** in the top-right or bottom-left portion of the page.

{/* How to manage Namespaces in Temporal Cloud using tcld */}

### Manage Namespaces in Temporal Cloud using tcld

To list Namespaces and get information about them, use the following [tcld](/cloud/tcld/) commands:

- [tcld namespace list](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#list)
- [tcld namespace get](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#get)

To manage certificates, use the [tcld namespace accepted-client-ca](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#accepted-client-ca) commands.
For more information, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates).

To manage certificate filters, use the [tcld namespace certificate-filters](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#certificate-filters)
commands. For more information, see
[How to manage certificate filters in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates#manage-certificate-filters).

## How to delete a Namespace in Temporal Cloud {#delete-a-namespace}

:::info

To delete a Namespace, a user must have Namespace Admin [permission](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions) for that
Namespace.

:::

### Delete a Namespace using Temporal Cloud UI

1. Go to the Temporal Cloud UI and log in.
1. On the left side of the window, select **Namespaces**.
1. On the **Namespaces** page, select a Namespace Name.
1. On the Namespace page, select **Edit** in the upper-right portion of the window.
1. On the **Edit** Namespace page, select **Delete Namespace** in the upper-right portion of the window.
1. In the **Delete Namespace** dialog, type `DELETE` to confirm the deletion of that Namespace.
1. Select **Delete**.

After deleting a Temporal Cloud Namespace, the Temporal Service immediately removes the Namespace's Workflow Executions
and Task Queues. Make sure all Workflows have been completed, canceled, or terminated before removing a Namespace. The
Namespace removal is permanent.

Closed Workflow Histories remain in Temporal storage until the user-defined retention period expires. This period
reflects the policy in effect when the Workflow Execution was closed.

For further questions or concerns, contact [Support](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/support#support-ticket).

### Delete a Namespace using tcld

See the [tcld namespace delete](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#delete) command reference for details.

### Namespace deletion protection {#delete-protection}

To prevent accidental Namespace deletion, Temporal Cloud provides a protection feature. When you enable Deletion
Protection for your production environment Namespace, you ensure that critical data won't be deleted unintentionally.

Follow these steps:

- Visit the [Namespaces page](https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces) on Temporal Cloud.
- Open your Namespace details page.
- Select the Edit button.
- Scroll down to Security and click the disclosure button (downward-facing caret).
- Enable **Deletion Protection**

<CaptionedImage
  src="/img/cloud/namespace/deletion-protection.png"
  title="Deletion Protection is enabled by toggling the switch"
/>

To enable or disable this feature using [`tcld`](/cloud/tcld), use the following command. Set the value to `true` to
enable or `false` to disable:

```
tcld namespace lifecycle set \
    --namespace <namespace_id.account_id> \
    --enable-delete-protection <Boolean>
```

## How to tag a Namespace in Temporal Cloud {#tag-a-namespace}

Tags are key-value metadata pairs that can be attached to namespaces in Temporal Cloud to help operators organize,
track, and manage namespaces more easily.

### Tag Structure and Limits

- Each namespace can have a maximum of 10 tags
- Each key must be unique for a given namespace (e.g., a namespace cannot have both `team:foo` and `team:bar` tags)
- Keys and values must be 1-63 characters in length
- Allowed characters: lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), periods (`.`), underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), and
  at signs (`@`)
- Tags are not a secure storage mechanism and should not store PII or PHI
- Tags will not change the behavior of the tagged resource
- There is a soft limit of 1000 unique tag keys per account

### Permissions

- Only [**Account Admins** and **Account Owners**](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) can create and edit tags
- All users with access to a namespace can view its tags

### tcld

See the [tcld namespace tags](/cloud/tcld/namespace/#tags) command reference for details.

### Terraform

See the
[Terraform provider](https://github.com/temporalio/terraform-provider-temporalcloud/blob/main/docs/resources/namespace_tags.md)
for details.

### Web UI

Tags can be viewed and managed through the Temporal Cloud web interface. When viewing a namespace, you'll see tags
displayed and can add, edit, or remove them if you have the appropriate permissions.
