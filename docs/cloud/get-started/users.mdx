Users are one of the primary access principals in Temporal Cloud. Each user is assigned one
[account-level role](/cloud/users#account-level-roles), and each role has a set of permissions. In addition to
account-level roles, users can also be assigned [Namespace-level permissions](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions)
for specific Namespaces. Each user can only perform an action if they have a role that grants them the necessary
permissions.

When you register for Temporal Cloud without joining an existing account, you are assigned the Account Owner role for a
new account. You can then invite other users to join the account and assign them roles.

## Invite users to your Temporal Cloud account {#invite-users}

import InvitationContent from '@site/docs/cloud/get-started/user-invite.mdx';

<InvitationContent />

In addition, there are two roles that the Global Admin cannot assign:

- **Account Owner**
  - Has full administrative permissions across the account, including users, usage and
    [billing](/cloud/billing-and-cost)
  - Can create and manage Namespaces and Nexus Endpoints
  - Has Namespace Admin [permissions](#namespace-level-permissions) on all [Namespaces](/namespaces) in the account.
    This permission cannot be revoked
- **Finance Admin**
  - Has permissions to view [billing](/cloud/billing-and-cost) information and update payment information
  - Otherwise, has the same permissions as Account Read-only users
  - Can be assigned to Service Accounts by a Global Admin, but otherwise can only be assigned by an Account Owner

## How to update an account-level role in Temporal Cloud {#update-roles}

With Global Admin or Account Owner privileges, you can update any user's account-level [role](#account-level-roles)
using either the Web UI or the tcld CLI utility. The Account Owner role can only be granted by existing Account Owners.

For security reasons, changes to the Account Owner role must be made through Temporal Support. To change or delete an
Account Owner, you must submit a [support ticket](https://temporalsupport.zendesk.com/).

## Account-level roles and Namespace-level permissions {#account-level-roles-and-namespace-level-permissions}

Temporal account-level roles and Namespace-level permissions provide access to specific Temporal Workflow and Temporal
Cloud operational APIs. The following table provides the API details associated with each account-level role and
Namespace-level permission.

## How to troubleshoot account access issues {#troubleshoot-access}

### Why can't I sign in after my email domain changed? {#email-domain-change}

If your organization changed its email domain (for example, from `@oldcompany.com` to `@newcompany.com`), you may be
unable to sign in to Temporal Cloud with your existing account.

**Why this happens:** When you sign in using "Continue with Google" or "Continue with Microsoft", Temporal Cloud
identifies your account by your email address. If your email address changes, Temporal Cloud sees this as a different
identity and cannot match it to your existing account.

**How to resolve this:** [Create a support ticket](/cloud/support#support-ticket) with the following information:

- Your previous email address (the one originally used to access Temporal Cloud)
- Your new email address
- Your Temporal Cloud Account Id (if known)

Temporal Support can update your account to use your new email address.

:::tip Use SAML for enterprise identity management

If your organization frequently changes email domains or wants centralized control over user authentication, consider
using [SAML authentication](/cloud/saml). With SAML, your identity provider (IdP) manages user identities, and email
domain changes can be handled within your IdP without affecting Temporal Cloud access.
