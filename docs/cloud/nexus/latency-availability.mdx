Nexus latency and availability in Temporal Cloud:

- **SLOs and SLAs** - Nexus requests have the same [latency SLOs](/cloud/service-availability#latency) and [availability SLAs](/cloud/sla) as other Worker requests in both caller and handler Namespaces.
- **[Nexus metrics](/nexus/metrics)** - SDK and Cloud latency metrics for monitoring Nexus performance.
- **Cross-Namespace connectivity** - Traffic routes through a global mTLS-secured Envoy mesh. Same-region Namespaces have low latency; cross-region latency varies by provider. See [secure connectivity](/nexus/security#secure-connectivity).
