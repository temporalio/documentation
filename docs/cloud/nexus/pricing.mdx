:::

Nexus pricing:

- **One Action to start or cancel a Nexus Operation** in the caller Namespace.
  Underlying primitives (Workflows, Activities, Signals) created by the handler result in normal Actions, including retries.
- **No Action for handling or retrying the Nexus Operation itself**.
  However, billable actions initiated by the handler (such as Activities) are charged if they fail and retry.

See [Pricing](/cloud/pricing) for details.
