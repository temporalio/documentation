## Quick start

You can clone the SDK from [https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go) or use `go get` from your Go project:

```
go get go.temporal.io/sdk@latest
```

You can also get started using an application template that already has the SDK as a dependency:

- [Money transfer application template](https://github.com/temporalio/money-transfer-project-template-go)
- ["Hello World!" application template](https://github.com/temporalio/hello-world-project-template-go)

Additional Go application samples are available here: [https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go)

## Reference

Go SDK reference is available here: [https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk)
