This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Temporal Visibility.

The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.

## Standard Visibility

Standard Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that list Workflow Executions by a predefined set of filters.

Open Workflow Executions can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, or Run Id.

Closed Workflow Executions can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, Run Id, or Execution Status (Completed, Failed, Timed Out, Terminated, Canceled, or Continued-As-New).

## Advanced Visibility

Advanced Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that enable the listing, filtering, and sorting of Workflow Executions through a custom SQL-like <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- With Temporal Cluster version 1.20 and later, Advanced Visibility is available on SQL databases like MySQL (version 8.0.17 and later) and PostgreSQL (version 12 and later), in addition to supporting Elasticsearch.
- For Temporal Server versions 1.19.1 and earlier, you must <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">integrate with ElasticSearch<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to integrate Elasticsearch into a Temporal Cluster</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To integrate Elasticsearch with your Temporal Cluster, edit the `persistence` section of your `development.yaml` configuration file and run the index schema setup commands.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to use Advanced Visibility.
  Elasticsearch takes on the Visibility request load, relieving potential performance issues. We highly recommend operating a Temporal Cluster with Elasticsearch for any use case that spawns more than just a few Workflow Executions.

## List Filter

A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to <a class="tdlp" href="#">Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Visibility?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> List API.

A List Filter contains <a class="tdlp" href="#search-attribute">Search Attribute<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#search-attribute">Learn more</a></span></span></a> names, Search Attribute values, and [operators](#supported-operators) to pull a filtered list of Workflow Executions from the Visibility store.

### Supported operators

A List Filter contains <a class="tdlp" href="#search-attribute">Search Attribute<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#search-attribute">Learn more</a></span></span></a> names, Search Attribute values, and the following supported operators:

- **=, !=, >, >=, <, <=**
- **AND, OR, ()**
- **BETWEEN ... AND**
- **IN**
- **ORDER BY**

The **ORDER BY** operator is supported only when Elasticsearch is used as the Visibility store.
Additionally, custom Search Attributes of the `Text` type cannot be used in **ORDER BY** clauses.

### Partial string match

The `=` operator works like **CONTAINS** to find Workflows with Search Attributes that contain a specific word.

<!-- note: advanced vis features will be supported in SQL upon the release of v1.20.-->

For example, if you have a custom Search Attribute named `Description` of `Text` type with the value of "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", searching for `Description=quick` or `Description=fox` will successfully return the Workflow.
However, partial word searches such as `Description=qui` or `Description=laz` will not return the Workflow.
This is because [Elasticsearch's tokenizer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-standard-tokenizer.html) is configured to return complete words as tokens.

### Efficient API usage

An Advanced List Filter API may take longer to respond if it is retrieving a large number of Workflow Executions (over 10,000).

With Temporal Server v1.20 and later, you can use the `CountWorkflow` API to efficiently count the number of <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Workflow Executions<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution. It is the main unit of execution of a Temporal Application.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Paginate the results with the `ListWorkflow` API by using the page token to retrieve the next page; continue until the page token is `null`/`nil`.

#### List Filter examples

The following is a List Filter set with <a class="tdlp" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">`tctl`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">tctl workflow list</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">How to list open or closed Workflow Executions using tctl.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">Learn more</a></span></span></a>:

```
WorkflowType = "main.YourWorkflowDefinition" and ExecutionStatus != "Running" and (StartTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or CloseTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34-08:00")
```

When used, a list of Workflows that meet the following conditions are returned:

- The Workflow Type is set to `main.YourWorkflowDefinition`.
- The Workflow isn't running.
- The Workflow either started after "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or closed after "2021-06-07T16:46:34-08:00".

More List Filter examples have been provided below.

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' or WorkflowId = '<another-workflow-id>'
```

```sql
WorkflowId IN ('<workflow-id>', '<another-workflow-id>')
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' order by StartTime desc
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' and ExecutionStatus = 'Running'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' or ExecutionStatus = 'Running'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' and StartTime > '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
ExecutionTime between '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00' and '2021-08-28T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
ExecutionTime < '2021-08-28T15:04:05+00:00' or ExecutionTime > '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
order by ExecutionTime
```

```sql
order by StartTime desc, CloseTime asc
```

```sql
order by CustomIntField asc
```

## Search Attribute

Search Attributes are indexed fields used in a <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to filter a list of [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution) that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.

A Search Attribute is a key-value pair metadata object and is part of the Workflow Execution visibility information, stored in the Visibility store. Use Search Attributes for metadata and search purposes only, not business logic.

Temporal provides [default Search Attributes](#default-search-attributes) out-of-the-box.
You can create [custom Search Attribute](#custom-search-attributes) keys in your Visibility store, and assign values in a Workflow Execution.

Search Attribute values are assigned to a specific Workflow Execution, and are available for that execution only up to the Namespace <a class="tdlp" href="/clusters#retention-period">Retention Period<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retention Period?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retention Period is the amount of time a Workflow Execution Event History remains in the Cluster's persistence store.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/clusters#retention-period">Learn more</a></span></span></a> specified.

When using <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Continue-As-New<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Continue-As-New?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Continue-As-New is the mechanism by which all relevant state is passed to a new Workflow Execution with a fresh Event History.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Temporal Cron Job<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cron Job?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, Search Attributes are carried over to the new Workflow Run by default.

#### Search Attributes limits

<!-- TODO - [How to configure maximum number of Search Attribute keys per Cluster](#) -->

The following table lists the maximum number of custom Search Attributes you can create per Namespace by supported Visibility database.

| Search Attribute Type | MySQL (v8.0.17 and later) | PostgreSQL (v12 and later) | SQLite (v3.31.0 and later) | Temporal Cloud |
| --------------------- | :-----------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------: |
| Keyword               |            10             |             10             |             10             |       20       |
| Keywordlist           |            10             |             10             |             10             |       20       |
| Text                  |             3             |             3              |             3              |       5        |

| Bool                  |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |

Temporal does not impose a limit on the number of custom Search Attributes you can create with Elasticsearch. However, [Elasticsearch sets a default mapping limit](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/mapping-settings-limit.html) that may apply.
Custom Search Attributes are an Advanced Visibility feature and are not supported on Cassandra.

After you create a custom Search Attribute, you can use it any number of times in your Workflows.

Size limits for Search Attribute:

<!--
_This refers to the SA key you create in the visibility store with `tctl search-attribute create`. this value is no longer applicable so commenting out for ref later_
Default total maximum number of Search Attribute **keys** per Temporal Cluster is 100.-->

- The default single Search Attribute **value** size limit is 2 KB.

<!-- TODO - [How to configure Search Attribute value size limit](#) -->

- Total Search Attribute size: 40 KB

<!-- TODO - [How to configure total Search Attribute size limite](#) -->

<!-- temp keeping for reference
This is configurable with [`SearchAttributesNumberOfKeysLimit`, `SearchAttributesTotalSizeLimit` and `SearchAttributesSizeOfValueLimit`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L440-L442), if you know what you are doing.
-->

#### Default Search Attributes

A Temporal Cluster has a set of default Search Attributes already available.
These Search Attributes are created when the initial index is created.

- All default Search Attributes are reserved and read-only.
  (You cannot create a custom one with the same name or alter the existing one.)

- `ExecutionStatus` values correspond to Workflow Execution Statuses: Running, Completed, Failed, Canceled, Terminated, ContinuedAsNew, TimedOut.

- StartTime, CloseTime, and ExecutionTime are stored as dates but are supported by queries that use either EpochTime in nanoseconds or a string in [RFC3339Nano format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants) (such as "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00").

- `ExecutionDuration` is stored in nanoseconds but is supported by queries that use integers in nanoseconds, [Golang duration format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration), or "hh:mm:ss" format.

- `CloseTime`, `HistoryLength`, `StateTransitionCount`, and `ExecutionDuration` are present only in a Closed Workflow Execution.

- `ExecutionTime` can differ from `StartTime` in retry and cron use cases.

You can use the default Search Attributes in a List Filter to get a list of specific Workflow Executions under the following conditions:

- Without Advanced Visibility, you can only use the `=` operator with a single default Search Attribute in your List Filter. For example: `tctl workflow list -q "ExecutionStatus = 'Completed'"` or `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = 'YourWorkflow'"`.
- With Advanced Visibility, you can combine default Search Attributes in a List Filter to get a list of specific Workflow Executions. For example: `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = "main.YourWorkflowDefinition" and ExecutionStatus != "Running" and (StartTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or CloseTime < "2021-06-08T16:46:34-08:00")"`

#### Custom Search Attributes

You can create custom Search Attributes with unique key names that are relevant to your business needs, using [`tctl search-attribute create`](/tctl-next/search-attribute#create).

Adding a custom Search Attribute to your Visibility store makes it available to use with Workflow Executions within that Cluster. With Temporal Server v1.20, your custom Search Attributes must be associated with a Namespace within your Temporal Cluster.

Use your custom Search Attributes in a List Filter, say in your WebUI or with the `tctl workflow list` commands, with the following conditions:

- Without Advanced Visibility, you cannot use a custom Search Attribute in your List Filter.
- With Advanced Visibility, you can create multiple custom Search Attributes and use them in combinations with List Filters to get specific Workflow Executions list. For example: `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = "main.YourWorkflowDefinition" and YourCustomSA = "YourCustomSAValue" and (StartTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or CloseTime < "2021-06-08T16:46:34-08:00")"`

  - With Temporal Server v1.20 and later, custom Search Attribute capabilities are available on MySQL (v8.0.17 or later), PostgreSQL (v12 and later), and SQLite (v3.31.0 and later), in addition to Elasticsearch.

See [Search Attribute limits](#search-attribute-limits) for limits on the number and size of custom Search Attributes you can create.

:::note
You can only add and remove custom Search Attributes. Renaming a custom Search Attributes is not supported.
:::

The [temporalio/auto-setup](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/auto-setup) Docker image uses a pre-defined set of custom Search Attributes that are handy for testing.
Their names indicate their types:

- CustomBoolField
- CustomDatetimeField
- CustomDoubleField
- CustomIntField
- CustomKeywordField
- CustomTextField

#### Types

Search Attributes must be one of the following types:

- Bool
- Datetime
- Double
- Int
- Keyword
- Keywordlist
- Text

Note:

- **Double** is backed up by `scaled_float` Elasticsearch type with scale factor 10000 (4 decimal digits).
- **Datetime** is backed up by `date` type with milliseconds precision in Elasticsearch 6 and `date_nanos` type with nanoseconds precision in Elasticsearch 7.
- **Int** is 64-bit integer (`long` Elasticsearch type).
- **Keyword** and **Text** types are concepts taken from Elasticsearch. Each word in a **Text** is considered a searchable keyword.
  For a UUID, that can be problematic because Elasticsearch indexes each portion of the UUID separately.
  To have the whole string considered as a searchable keyword, use the **Keyword** type.
  For example, if the key `ProductId` has the value of `2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`:
  - As a **Keyword** it would be matched only by `ProductId = "2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`.
  - As a **Text** it would be matched by `ProductId = 2dd8`, which could cause unwanted matches.
- The **Text** type cannot be used in the "Order By" clause.

#### Search Attributes as Workflow Execution metadata

To actually have results from the use of a <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, Search Attributes must be added to a Workflow Execution as metadata.
How to do this entirely depends on the method by which you spawn the Workflow Execution:
