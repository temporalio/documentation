This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Temporal Visibility.

The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.

## Standard Visibility

Standard Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that list Workflow Executions by a predefined set of filters.

Open Workflow Executions can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, or Run Id.

Closed Workflow Executions can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, Run Id, or Execution Status (Completed, Failed, Timed Out, Terminated, Canceled, or Continued-As-New).

## Advanced Visibility

Advanced Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that enable the listing, filtering, and sorting of Workflow Executions through a custom SQL-like <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</p><p class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></p></div></a>.

To use Advanced Visibility, your Temporal Cluster must be <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">integrated with Elasticsearch<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">How to integrate Elasticsearch into a Temporal Cluster</p><p class="tdlppd">To integrate Elasticsearch with your Temporal Cluster, edit the `persistence` section of your `development.yaml` configuration file and run the index schema setup commands.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">Learn more</a></p></div></a>.
We highly recommend operating a Temporal Cluster with Elasticsearch for any use case that spawns more than just a few Workflow Executions.
Elasticsearch takes on the Visibility request load, relieving potential performance issues.

## List Filter

A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an <a class="tdlp" href="#advanced-visibility">Advanced Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">What is Advanced Visibility?</p><p class="tdlppd">Advanced Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that enable the listing, filtering, and sorting of Workflow Executions through an SQL-like query syntax.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a href="#advanced-visibility">Learn more</a></p></div></a> List API.

- [How to use a List Filter using tctl](/tctl-v1/workflow#list)

The following is an example List Filter:

```
WorkflowType = "main.YourWorkflowDefinition" and ExecutionStatus != "Running" and (StartTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or CloseTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34-08:00") order by StartTime desc
```

[More example List Filters](#example-list-filters)

A List Filter contains <a class="tdlp" href="#search-attribute">Search Attribute<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</p><p class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a href="#search-attribute">Learn more</a></p></div></a> names, Search Attribute values, and Operators.

- The following operators are supported in List Filters:

  - **=, !=, >, >=, <, <=**
  - **AND, OR, ()**
  - **BETWEEN ... AND**
  - **IN**
  - **ORDER BY**

- A List Filter applies to a single Namespace.

- The range of a List Filter timestamp (StartTime, CloseTime, ExecutionTime) cannot exceed 9223372036854775807 (that is, maxInt64 - 1001).

- A List Filter that uses a time range has a resolution of 1 ms on Elasticsearch 6 and 1 ns on Elasticsearch 7.

- List Filter Search Attribute names are case sensitive.

- An Advanced List Filter API may take longer than expected if it is retrieving a large number of Workflow Executions (more than 10 million).

- A `ListWorkflow` API supports pagination.
  Use the page token in the following call to retrieve the next page; continue until the page token is `null`/`nil`.

- To efficiently count the number of Workflow Executions, use the `CountWorkflow` API.

#### Example List Filters

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' or WorkflowId = '<another-workflow-id>'
```

```sql
WorkflowId IN ('<workflow-id>', '<another-workflow-id>')
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' order by StartTime desc
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' and ExecutionStatus = 'Running'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' or ExecutionStatus = 'Running'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' and StartTime > '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
ExecutionTime between '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00' and '2021-08-28T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
ExecutionTime < '2021-08-28T15:04:05+00:00' or ExecutionTime > '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
order by ExecutionTime
```

```sql
order by StartTime desc, CloseTime asc
```

```sql
order by CustomIntField asc
```

#### Search Attributes maximums

Default total maximum number of Search Attribute **keys** per Temporal Cluster is 100.

<!-- TODO - [How to configure maximum number of Search Attribute keys per Cluster](#) -->

Default single Search Attribute **value** size limit is 2 KB.

<!-- TODO - [How to configure Search Attribute value size limit](#) -->

Total Search Attribute size: 40 KB

<!-- TODO - [How to configure total Search Attribute size limite](#) -->

<!-- temp keeping for reference
This is configurable with [`SearchAttributesNumberOfKeysLimit`, `SearchAttributesTotalSizeLimit` and `SearchAttributesSizeOfValueLimit`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L440-L442), if you know what you are doing.

#### Default Search Attributes

A Temporal Cluster that is integrated with Elasticsearch has a set of default Search Attributes already available.
These Search Attributes are created when the initial index is created.

- All default Search Attributes are reserved and read-only.
  (You cannot create a custom one with the same name or alter the existing one.)

- ExecutionStatus values correspond to Workflow Execution Statuses: Running, Completed, Failed, Canceled, Terminated, ContinuedAsNew, TimedOut.

- StartTime, CloseTime, and ExecutionTime are stored as dates but are supported by queries that use either EpochTime in nanoseconds or a string in [RFC3339Nano format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants) (such as "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00").

- ExecutionDuration is stored in nanoseconds but is supported by queries that use integers in nanoseconds, [Golang duration format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration), or "hh:mm:ss" format.

- CloseTime, HistoryLength, StateTransitionCount, and ExecutionDuration are present only in a Closed Workflow Execution.

- ExecutionTime can differ from StartTime in retry and cron use cases.

#### Custom Search Attributes

Custom Search Attributes can be [added to a Temporal Cluster by using `tctl search-attribute create`.
Adding a Search Attribute makes it available to use with Workflow Executions within that Cluster.

There is no hard limit on the number of attributes you can add.
However, we recommend enforcing the following limits:

- Number of Search Attributes: 100 per Workflow
- Size of each value: 2 KB per value
- Total size of names and values: 40 KB per Workflow

:::note

Due to Elasticsearch limitations, you can only add Search Attributes.
It is not possible to rename Search Attributes or remove them from the index schema.

:::

The [temporalio/auto-setup](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/auto-setup) Docker image uses a pre-defined set of custom Search Attributes that are handy for testing.
Their names indicate their types:

- CustomBoolField
- CustomDatetimeField
- CustomDoubleField
- CustomIntField
- CustomKeywordField
- CustomTextField

#### Types

Search Attributes must be one of the following types:

- Bool
- Datetime
- Double
- Int
- Keyword
- Text

Note:

- **Double** is backed up by `scaled_float` Elasticsearch type with scale factor 10000 (4 decimal digits).
- **Datetime** is backed up by `date` type with milliseconds precision in Elasticsearch 6 and `date_nanos` type with nanoseconds precision in Elasticsearch 7.
- **Int** is 64-bit integer (`long` Elasticsearch type).
- **Keyword** and **Text** types are concepts taken from Elasticsearch. Each word in a **Text** is considered a searchable keyword.
  For a UUID, that can be problematic because Elasticsearch indexes each portion of the UUID separately.
  To have the whole string considered as a searchable keyword, use the **Keyword** type.
  For example, if the key `ProductId` has the value of `2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`:
  - As a **Keyword** it would be matched only by `ProductId = "2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`.
  - As a **Text** it would be matched by `ProductId = 2dd8`, which could cause unwanted matches.
- The **Text** type cannot be used in the "Order By" clause.

#### Search Attributes as Workflow Execution metadata

To actually have results from the use of a <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</p><p class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></p></div></a>, Search Attributes must be added to a Workflow Execution as metadata.
How to do this entirely depends on the method by which you spawn the Workflow Execution:
