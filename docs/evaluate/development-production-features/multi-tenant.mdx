A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform -- but even a single Namespace is still multi-tenant.
Multi-tenancy ensures extra capacity is available for all customers during traffic spikes.

However, multi-tenancy can also presents the challenge of "noisy neighbors", where high-traffic tenants consume excess resources, causing slower performance for other tenants.
This is a common problem for database scaling.

Temporal's write-heavy workload, where changes in execution state are constantly written to the persistence layer, demands a database that supports reliably high throughput with low latency for multiple customers, concurrently and fairly.

With Temporal Cloud, customers pay for consumption instead of entire sets of hardware, providing a cost-effective solution.
Temporal Cloud's architecture scales to handle multiple tenants efficiently.
