Multi-tenancy in Temporal operates at two levels:

## Namespace isolation

**How Temporal Cloud isolates your namespaces from each other.**

The nature of Temporal workloads – write- and read-heavy, with strong consistency and latency requirements – can make multi-tenant operations challenging. Without careful design, 'noisy neighbor' problems arise when one customer's traffic spike degrades performance for others. 

Temporal Cloud is a multi-tenant service that isolates each namespace to provide cost-effective, consumption-based pricing while maintaining enterprise-grade security, reliability, and capacity to handle traffic spikes. Each namespace has:

- **Independent authentication** via [API keys](/cloud/api-keys) or [mTLS certificates](/cloud/certificates)
- **Separate [rate limits](/cloud/limits#namespace-level)** to prevent noisy neighbor problems
- **Controlled inter-namespace communication** only through [Nexus](/evaluate/nexus)

## Application multi-tenancy

**How to build multi-tenant applications using Temporal.**

Many organizations use Temporal Cloud to power their own multi-tenant SaaS application. Temporal provides patterns for isolating your tenants using:

- **Task queues per tenant** for workload isolation
- **Worker design patterns** for efficient resource utilization
- **Search attributes** for tenant-specific queries

The [best practices guide](/production-deployment/multi-tenant-patterns) includes detailed recommendations and factors to consider when architecting your multi-tenant application on Temporal Cloud.
