In Temporal, **Child Workflows** enable applications to achieve another level of composability when it comes to throughput.

The following example scenarios are a few reasons to use this feature:

- To create a separate service that can be invoked from multiple other services or applications.
- To partition a step into smaller smaller chunks.
- To manage a dedicated resource and guarantee uniqueness.
- To execute logic periodically without overwhelming the parent business process.

See the SDK feature guides for implementation details:
