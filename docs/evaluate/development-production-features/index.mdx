Through a Temporal SDK, Temporal provides a wide range of features that enable developers to build applications that serve a wide range of use cases.

- **[Core application primitives](/evaluate/development-production-features/core-application)**: Develop and run your application with Workflows, Activities, and Workers.
- **[Testing suite](/evaluate/development-production-features/testing-suite)**: Each Temporal SDK comes with a testing suite that enables developers to test their applications as they would any other.
- **[Temporal Clients](/evaluate/development-production-features/temporal-client)**: Communicate with the Temporal Service to start your application, send it messages, cancel a business process, and more.
- **[Scheduled Workflows](/evaluate/development-production-features/schedules)**: Start a business process at a specific time or on a given time interval.
- **[Interrupt a Workflow](/evaluate/development-production-features/interrupt-workflow)**: Cancel or terminate a business process (Workflow) that is already in progress and compensate for any steps already taken.
- **Runtime safeguards**: Prevent avoidable errors and issues from executing during runtime.
- **[Failure detection and mitigation](/evaluate/development-production-features/failure-detection)**: Detect failures with timeouts and configure automatic retries to mitigate them.
- **[Workflow message passing](/evaluate/development-production-features/workflow-message-passing)**: Build responsive applications that react to events at runtime and enable data retrieval from ongoing Workflows.
- **Versioning**: Support multiple versions of your business logic for long-running business processes.
- **[Observability](/evaluate/development-production-features/observability)**: List business process, view their state, and setup dashboards with metrics.
- **[Debugging](/evaluate/development-production-features/debugging)**: Surface errors and step through code to find issues.
- **[Data encryption](/evaluate/development-production-features/data-encryption)**: Transform data and protect the privacy of the users of your application.
- **[Throughput composability](/evaluate/development-production-features/throughput-composability)**: Breakup business processes by data streams, team ownership, or other organization factors.
- **[Cloud Automation](/evaluate/development-production-features/cloud-automation)**: Simplify cloud management and boost security with Temporal's Cloud Automation.
- **[Low Latency](/evaluate/development-production-features/low-latency)**: Making your applications faster, more performant, and more efficient.
