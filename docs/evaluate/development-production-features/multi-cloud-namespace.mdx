Temporal Cloud offers disaster-tolerant deployment for workloads with stringent availability requirements.
With the multi-cloud feature enabled, Temporal Cloud automates [failover](/glossary#failover) and synchronizes data between Namespaces hosted on different cloud providers (either AWS or GCP).
This page introduces Temporal Cloud patterns that support your workload's availability requirements.

## Multi-cloud Replication

Multi-cloud Replication provides failover capabilities to mitigate service outages due to cloud provider failures.
It reduces risk and minimize operational disruption.
This feature seamlessly shif​​ts Workflow execution between cloud providers to maintain service availability.

Your Clients use a single logical Namespace with a single endpoint that operates on two separate cloud providers: one active and one standby.
As Workflows progress in the active provider, history events asynchronously replicate to the standby provider.
Data replication ensures both providers are in sync so the standby is ready to take over when needed.

Should an incident or outage occur in the active provider, Temporal Cloud initiates a "failover" to the standby provider.
During a failover, the roles of the active and standby providers reverse.
The standby takes over as the primary provider.

### Advantages of Multi-cloud Replication {#multi-region-advantages}

**Why choose Multi-cloud Replication (MCR)?**

- **Reduce Risk**:
  Protects your operations from unexpected cloud provider outages.
  Automated disaster recovery features ensure that workloads remain available and continue execution.
- **Minimize Operational Disruption**:
  Seamless failovers shift Workflow Executions to a secondary provider during outages.
  Maintains service availability without needing manual synchronization between Namespaces.
  Real-time alerts during failover events keep you informed.
- **No manual deployment or configuration needed:**
  Temporal Cloud simplifies deployment with push-button operation.
  This eliminates the need for manual deployment or configuration.
- **Fault tolerance**.
  Your open Workflows continue their progress in the standby region.
  This minimizes interruption and data loss during cloud provider failures.
- **No code changes**.
  Your Workers and Workflow starter code don't need updates to take advantage of multi-cloud setup or to respond to failover conditions.
  This allows for a smooth transition and continued operation.

### Service Level Objectives (SLO) and guarantees {#cloud-region-SLO}

**What reliability promises does this feature offer?**

- Temporal provides a 99.99% Contractual SLA that provides redress in the event of downtime ([SLA](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla)).
- [RTO](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/recovery_time_objective): 20 minutes or less.
- [RPO](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/recovery_point_objective): Near zero.

### Target workloads {#target-workloads}

**Who benefits from this feature?**

Multi-cloud Namespaces are a great solution for Workloads where a regional cloud outage would cause:

- Revenue loss
- Poor customer experience
- Problems stemming from policy/legal requirements that demand high availability

Some examples: financial services, e-commerce, gaming, global SaaS platforms, bookings & reservations, delivery & shipping, order management.
