Temporal Schedules is a feature that allows you to "schedule" Temporal Workflows at specified times or intervals, adjusting for peak use.

It offers a flexible way to automate and manage your Temporal Workflows, ensuring your business processes run smoothly and efficiently especially when handling time-sensitive tasks.

1. **Automate Repetitive Tasks:**
   Schedules automate repetitive tasks, reducing manual intervention and ensuring timely execution of business processes.
2. **Enhanced Workflow Control and Observability:**
   Gain complete control over your automation processes. With Schedules, you can create, backfill, delete, describe, list, pause, trigger, and update Workflow Executions.
3. **Flexible Timing:**
   Schedule Workflow Executions to run at regular intervals or specific future times, ensuring they execute precisely when needed.
4. **Reliable and Scalable:**
   Designed for reliability and scalability, Temporal Schedules handle the complexities of distributed systems while ensuring your Workflows run as intended, even during failures.
5. **Eliminate External Dependencies:**
   Schedules remove the need to integrate external scheduling systems.
