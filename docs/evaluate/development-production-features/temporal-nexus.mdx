:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](https://docs.temporal.io/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages\#public-preview) for both self-hosted deployments and Temporal Cloud with the [Temporal Go SDK](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/go). 

:::

Temporal Nexus is a feature of the Temporal platform designed to connect durable executions across team, Namespace, region, and cloud boundaries.*
It promotes a more modular architecture for sharing a subset of your team’s capabilities through well-defined service API contracts for other teams to use, that abstract underlying Temporal primitives, like Workflows, or execute arbitrary code.

For a deep dive into Temporal Nexus, see the [Temporal Nexus Encyclopedia section](https://docs.temporal.io/temporalnexus).

Temporal keeps the runtime benefits of an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) where services can be down without affecting each other, but offers a higher-level durable execution programming model that lets you write idiomatic code in any language and preserve the state of execution.
This ensures that your Workflows can be resumed automatically in the presence of failure, without the extensive boilerplate code and complexity that comes with using raw EDA frameworks directly.

With Temporal Nexus, inter-service communication and durable execution can span teams, Namespaces, and regions all from within the Temporal context. 
Nexus preserves a familiar API programming model that supports both synchronous and asynchronous patterns, is suitable for low-latency and long-running operations, and uses an optimized form of the Temporal queue-based Worker architecture to preserve the benefits of EDA at runtime.

Temporal Nexus provides an integrated Temporal SDK experience, built-in Nexus Machinery, first-class observability, and enables each team to have their own Namespace for improved security, troubleshooting, and blast radius isolation.
It allows multiple teams to collaborate autonomously while maintaining a clean separation of concerns, ensuring that applications are scalable, secure, and easy to manage as they grow.

With Temporal Nexus, teams are able to:
- **Easily scale and manage applications** by breaking them into modular components developed separately while maintaining smooth integration through clear service contracts.
- **Run Workflows across teams and Namespaces**, enabling durable execution and custom code to operate seamlessly across different parts of the system.
- **Enhance security by isolating different parts of the application**, reducing the risk and impact of potential issues.
- **Continue using familiar tools like queue-based Workers**, without the need for complex new setups or deployments.

_*Cross cloud calls are not available yet on Temporal Cloud. Only single cluster deployments are supported for self-hosted._
