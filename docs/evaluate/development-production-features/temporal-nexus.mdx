:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is now [Generally Available](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#general-availability) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

:::

Nexus connects Temporal Applications across (and within) isolated Namespaces with built-in durability, observability, and security.
Each team gets their own Namespace for improved security and fault isolation, while sharing capabilities through clean service contracts.
Watch the [Nexus overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ1OwSFokOg&t=117s) for a walkthrough.

## Who's using Nexus?

Companies using Nexus include:

- **Duolingo** - Self-service infrastructure ([Case study](https://temporal.io/resources/case-studies/duolingo-temporal-nexus) | [Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ1OwSFokOg&t=524s))
- **Netflix** - Infrastructure orchestration ([Replay talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izR9dQ_eIe4&t=470s) | [Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At1FfqGQiu0&t=1295s))
- **Miro** - Cross-region data migration ([Replay talk](https://youtu.be/YLmFR-IAC3M?feature=shared&t=1488))

## Benefits

Connect Temporal Applications across teams, domains, regions, and clouds with:

- **Stronger security posture** - Built-in access controls for a specific service contract instead of broad Namespace access. Easier audits and safer cross-team collaboration.
- **Higher reliability** - Durable, atomic handoffs remove lost requests and hand-rolled retry and deduplication logic.
- **Reduced engineering overhead** - Less code, custom retry, deduplication, and refactoring work. Teams ship features faster.
- **Scalable platform patterns** - Enables platform-level orchestration (cross-region, cross-team) without centralizing ownership.
- **New workflows and integrations** - Frees teams to add more Workflows once Nexus is adopted, especially shared services or cross-team use cases.

## Why separate Namespaces?

As teams and workloads grow, separate Namespaces provide:

- **Security** - Sensitive data (PCI, PII) stays in a restricted Namespace with its own encryption key and access controls.
- **Fault isolation** - Misbehaving Workers in one Namespace don't trigger rate limits or affect other teams.
- **Compliance** - Data residency requirements may mandate isolated regions or Namespaces.
- **Ownership** - Each team controls their own Namespace, Workers, and deployment lifecycle.

Before Nexus, connecting Namespaces required workarounds:

- **Child Workflows** - Leaky abstraction. Caller must know target Namespace, Task Queue, and Workflow policy options. Same-Namespace only in Temporal Cloud.
- **Activity wrappers** - Require an mTLS client per target, grant full Namespace write access, no integrated observability, error-prone boilerplate for async results.
- **Bespoke gateways** - Not durable, poor cross-service debugging, another service to manage and patch.

Nexus replaces all of these with a clean service contract between caller and handler, less code, and first-class observability.


## Should I use Nexus?

Use the following decision tree to help determine if Nexus is right for your use case:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', margin: '2rem 0'}}>

        dark: '/diagrams/nexusadoptiondark.svg',
      }}
      style={{maxWidth: '100%', cursor: 'pointer'}}
    />
