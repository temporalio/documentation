Data Converters in Temporal are SDK components that handle the serialization and encoding of data transmitted and received by a Temporal Client.
Workflow input and output need to be serialized and deserialized so they can be sent as JSON to the Temporal Service.

Temporal provides its own default Data Converter logic, which is not apparent to a user if payloads contain plain text or JSON data.
For enhanced security, you can implement your own encryption standards using a Codec Server.
Temporal's data encryption capabilities ensures the security and confidentiality of your Workflows and provides protection without compromising performance.
