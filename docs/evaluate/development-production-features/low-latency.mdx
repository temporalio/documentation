Temporal Cloud provides features that significantly reduce latency compared to self-hosted instances, making your applications faster, more performant, and more efficient.
In the world of modern applications, low latency is crucial for ensuring minimal delay in Workflow Executions.
This low-latency architecture ensures rapid Workflow Execution and responsiveness, critical for time-sensitive applications and high-performance systems.

Temporal Cloud's custom persistence layer incorporates three key components that contribute to low latency:

- **Better Sharding:** Distributes load across multiple databases, preventing bottlenecks.
  Enables independent resizing, improving scalability and handling high-traffic events without delay.
- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL):** Aggregates updates before writing to the database, reducing write latency.
  Stores writes in an append-only format, reducing latency and database size by batching updates before writing to the database.
- **Tiered Storage of Workflow Event History:** Offloads completed Workflow Event Histories, improving database efficiency.

Temporal Cloud provides lower latency, making it suitable for latency-sensitive, large-scale, or business-critical applications.
