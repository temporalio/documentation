Need a responsive Workflow?
Temporal provides **Signals**, **Queries**, and **Updates** as a means to send data into and get data out of your running Workflow.
Signals enable your Workflow to asynchronously react to events at runtime, Queries enable on-demand data retrieval from ongoing Workflows without disrupting their execution, and Updates enable you to change the state of a running Workflow.

**Signals**: Signals allow you to send messages asynchronously to running Workflow Executions, enabling you to change their state and control their flow in real-time.
This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where Workflows must react to external events or user interactions.

**Queries**: Queries provide a way to access and monitor the internal state of your Workflow Executions in real-time.
This is essential for monitoring the progress of long-running Workflows and retrieving their results.

**Updates**: An Update is a synchronous, blocking call that could replace both a Signal and a Query.

See the SDK feature guides for implementation details.
