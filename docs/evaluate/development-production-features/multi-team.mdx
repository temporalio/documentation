Temporal Nexus is an integrated feature of the Temporal platform designed to connect durable executions across team and Namespace boundaries.

When organizations build applications, whether small or large, it’s essential to design them in a modular way to ensure scalability and adaptability. 
This involves breaking the application into smaller, manageable parts that can be developed and operated by different teams. 

While this modular approach supports growth and evolution without requiring major changes, existing solutions often result in tightly coupled Workflows, complex integrations, and security risks.
Teams collaborating on a Temporal Application often seek the isolation and security provided by separate Namespaces. However, they also need durable execution that works seamlessly across team and Namespace boundaries, ensuring secure integration with a clean separation of concerns.

**Key Capabilities**

Temporal Nexus is designed to help multiple teams to collaborate autonomously while maintaining a clean separation of concerns, ensuring that applications are scalable, secure, and easy to manage as they grow.

With Temporal Nexus, teams are able to:
- **Easily scale and manage applications** by breaking them into modular components that can be developed separately while maintaining smooth integration through clear service contracts.
- **Run Workflows across teams and Namespaces**, enabling durable execution and custom code to operate seamlessly across different parts of the system.
- **Enhance security by isolating different parts of the application**, reducing the risk and impact of potential issues.
- **Continue using familiar tools like queue-based workers**, without the need for complex new setups or deployments.

## Core Components of Temporal Nexus

Temporal Nexus supports improved modularity and multi-team collaboration, by allowing teams to define a clean Nexus Service API contract for other teams to use, that abstract underlying Temporal primitives, like Workflows.

Nexus Services are exposed from a Nexus Endpoint that is created in the Nexus API Registry, along with service documentation that enable others to use the Nexus Services provided by a Nexus Endpoint. This enables teams to compose Nexus Services into their workflows, both within and across namespace boundaries.

Nexus is designed to connect durable executions across team and namespace boundaries with an integrated Temporal SDK experience, built-in Nexus Machinery that processes Nexus RPC calls on your behalf, and promotes a more modular architecture for sharing a subset of your team’s capabilities via a well-defined Nexus Service API contract.

**Nexus API Registry:** A `Nexus API Registry` is a list of Nexus `Endpoints` available within a Temporal environment. 
Adding a Nexus `Endpoint` allows Nexus Operation requests to be sent to the Worker listening on the Endpoint’s target Namespace and Task Queue, from a caller Workflow using the name of the Endpoint in the Nexus API Registry.

**Nexus Endpoints:** A Nexus `Endpoint` is like an API proxy that can serve one or more Nexus `Services` from a `Worker` listening on a target Namespace and Task Queue. 
This enables presenting a clean API contract and hiding the underlying Temporal implementation, which may consist of internal `Workflows`, `Signals`, and other Temporal primitives – or arbitrary code. 
In Temporal Cloud an endpoint’s access-control policy determines which callers are allowed to access a Nexus `Endpoint`.

**Nexus Services:** A Nexus `Service` is a named collection of arbitrary-duration Nexus `Operations` that provide an API contract suitable for sharing across team boundaries. 
Nexus Services are registered with a `Worker` that is listening on the target Namespace and Task Queue for an `Endpoint`.

**Nexus Operations:** A Nexus `Operation` is not intrinsically durable, but can be made durable by backing it with Temporal primitives like a `Workflow`, `Update`, or `Signal`.
The Temporal SDK provides helper functions to create Nexus Operations that may be registered with a Nexus Service in a `Worker`. 
Synchronous Nexus `Operations` can also execute arbitrary code, but unlike `Activities` they have a short request timeout (under 10 seconds) and don’t support [heartbeats](https://community.temporal.io/t/best-practices-for-long-running-activities/934).

## Nexus in Action
The developer experience for Nexus callers and handlers is the same across both OSS and Cloud environments. 
Callers use the Temporal SDK to execute Nexus Operations within a Workflow, while handlers use the SDK to create Nexus Services that are registered with a Worker.

Temporal Nexus is supported in three environments:

* Development Temporal Service  
  * Nexus must be enabled via dynamic config while in Public Preview.  
* Self-hosted Temporal Service  
  * Cross-namespace calls work within a self-hosted cluster  
  * Nexus registry is cluster-scoped  
  * Future releases may add cross-cluster Nexus registry support  
  * See configuration details for self-hosted
* Temporal Cloud  
  * Nexus registry is account-scoped  
  * Cross-namespace calls work across cloud cells (clusters) and regions  
  * See the Temporal Nexus guide for Temporal Cloud
