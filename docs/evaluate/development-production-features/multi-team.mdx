Building distributed applications of any size often requires a modular architecture and multiple teams collaborating, with each responsible for their slice of the overall application.

Teams would like to build, operate, and deliver in an autonomous manner while allowing their slice to be used by other teams – but they also want the improved security and blast-radius isolation of separate namespaces.

Existing solutions to modularize a Temporal application have several challenges:
- Direct workflow to workflow integration is a leaky abstraction with tight coupling
- Child Workflows don’t work across namespace boundaries in Temporal Cloud
- Activities that invoke workflows in a different namespace often have full access via mTLS certs that must be exchanged and rotated, plus second-class observability and execution debugging.

Temporal Nexus supports improved modularity and multi-team collaboration, by allowing teams to define a clean Nexus Service API contract for other teams to use, that abstract underlying Temporal primitives, like Workflows.

Nexus Services are exposed from a Nexus Endpoint that is created in the Nexus API Registry, along with service documentation that enable others to use the Nexus Services provided by a Nexus Endpoint. 
This enables teams to compose Nexus Services into their workflows, both within and across namespace boundaries.

Nexus is designed to connect durable executions across team and namespace boundaries with an integrated Temporal SDK experience, built-in Nexus Machinery that processes Nexus RPC calls on your behalf, and promotes a more modular architecture for sharing a subset of your team’s capabilities via a well-defined Nexus Service API contract.

- **Nexus API Registry**: A `Nexus API Registry` is a list of Nexus Endpoints available within a Temporal environment. Adding a Nexus Endpoint allows Nexus Operation requests to be sent to the Worker listening on the Endpoint’s target Namespace and Task Queue, from a caller Workflow using the name of the Endpoint in the Nexus API Registry.

- **Nexus Endpoints**: A Nexus Endpoint is like an API proxy that can serve one or more Nexus Services from a Worker listening on a target Namespace and Task Queue. 
This enables presenting a clean API contract and hiding the underlying Temporal implementation, which may consist of internal Workflows, Signals, and other Temporal primitives – or arbitrary code. 
In Temporal Cloud an endpoint’s access-control policy determines which callers are allowed to access a Nexus Endpoint.

- **Nexus Services**: A Nexus Service is a named collection of arbitrary-duration Nexus Operations that provide an API contract suitable for sharing across team boundaries. Nexus Services are registered with a Worker that is listening on the target Namespace and Task Queue for an Endpoint.
  
- **Nexus Operations**: A Nexus Operation is not intrinsically durable, but can be made durable by backing it with Temporal primitives like a Workflow, Update, or Signal. 
The Temporal SDK provides helper functions to create Nexus Operations that may be registered with a Nexus Service in a Worker. Synchronous Nexus Operations can also execute arbitrary code, but unlike Activities they should be relatively short-lived, due to the lack of heartbeats and a 10 second request timeout.
