import * as Components from '@site/src/components';

Temporal Cloud is a consumption-based service.
You pay only for what you use.
Our pricing reflects your use of [_Actions_](#action), [_Storage_](#storage), and [_Support_](/cloud/support#support).
It is flexible, transparent, and predictable, so you know your costs.

This page describes the elements of Temporal Cloud pricing.
It gives you the information you need to understand and estimate costs for your implementation.
For more exact estimates, please reach out to [our team](https://pages.temporal.io/ask-an-expert).

Billing and cost information is available directly in the Temporal Cloud UI.
For more information, visit the [Billing and Cost](/cloud/billing-and-cost) page.

## Temporal Cloud pricing model {#pricing-model}

This section explains the basis of the Temporal Cloud pricing model and how it works.
Your total invoice each calendar month is the combination of Temporal Cloud consumption ([Actions](#action) and [Storage](#storage)), and a [Temporal Cloud Plan](#base_plans) that includes [Support](/cloud/support#support).

### Temporal Cloud Plans {#base_plans}

**How plans work**

:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

SCIM support is available in [Pre-release](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#pre-release).

:::

Each Temporal Cloud account includes a plan with Support, Actions, Active Storage, Retained Storage and platform features.
Base allocations help you get started with the Temporal platform, so you can better estimate costs.

- Temporal Cloud Plans are charged monthly.
- Action and Storage allocations are reset each calendar month.

Temporal offers four plans: Essential, Business, Enterprise, Mission Critical.
Prices are outlined in the following table:

|                   | Essentials                                                                     | Business                                                                                                                          | Enterprise                                                                                                                      | Mission Critical                                                                                                                |

### Actions {#action}

**What are Temporal Actions?**

Actions are the primary unit of consumption-based pricing for Temporal Cloud.
They track billable operations within the Temporal Cloud Service, such as starting Workflows, recording a Heartbeat or sending messages.

<Components.DiscoverableDisclosure label="Operations that result in Actions">

**WORKFLOWS**

- **Workflow started**.
  Occurs via client start, client [Signal-With-Start](/sending-messages#signal-with-start), [Continue-As-New](/workflows#continue-as-new), or [Child Workflow](/child-workflows) start.
  If a Workflow start fails, an Action is not recorded.
- **Workflow reset**.
  Occurs when a [Workflow](/workflows) is reset.
  (Actions that occur before a [Reset](/workflows#reset) are counted even if they are no longer visible in [Event History](/workflows#event-history).)
- **Timer started**.
  Includes implicit Timers that are started by a Temporal SDK when timeouts are set, such as `AwaitWithTimeout` in Go or `condition` in TypeScript.
- **Search Attribute upsert requested**.
  Occurs for each invocation of `UpsertSearchAttributes` command.
  Multiple Search Attributes updated in a single `UpsertSearchAttributes` command count as one Action.
  Search Attributes specified during Workflow start are _excluded_ from Action counts.
  The `TemporalChangeVersion` Search Attribute, used for Workflow versioning, is also exempt from Action counting.
- **Signal sent**.
  An Action occurs for every [Signal](/sending-messages#sending-signals), whether sent from a Client or from a Workflow.
- **Query received by Worker**.
  An Action occurs for every [Query](/sending-messages#sending-queries), including viewing the call stack in the Temporal Cloud UI, which results in a Query behind the scenes.
- **Update received by Worker**.
  An Action occurs for every successful [Update](/sending-messages#sending-updates) and every [rejected](/handling-messages#update-validators) Update.
  De-duplicated Updates that share an Update ID do _not_ count as an Action.
- **Side Effect recorded**.
  For a mutable [Side Effect](/workflows#side-effect), an Action occurs only when the value changes.
  (Be aware that some SDKs don't support Side Effects.)

**CHILD WORKFLOWS**

- **Child Workflows spawned**.
  The parent Workflow spawning a Child Workflow results in one Action.
- **Child Workflows executed**.
  Execution of the Child Workflow results in one Action.

**ACTIVITIES**

- **Activity started or retried**.
  Occurs each time an Activity is started or retried.
- **Local Activity started**.
  All [Local Activities](/local-activity) associated with one Workflow Task count as a single Action.
  That's because Temporal Cloud counts all [RecordMarkers](/references/commands#recordmarker) from each Workflow Task as one action, and not _N_ actions.
  Please note:
  - Each additional Workflow Task heartbeat after counts as an additional Action.
  - Local Activities retried following a Workflow Task heartbeat count as one Action (capped at 100 Actions).
- **Activity Heartbeat recorded**.
  A Heartbeat call from Activity code counts as an Action only if it reaches the [Temporal Server](/clusters#temporal-server).
  Temporal SDKs throttle [Activity Heartbeats](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat).
  The default throttle is 80% of the [Heartbeat Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#heartbeat-timeout).
  Heartbeats don't apply to Local Activities.

**SCHEDULES**

[Schedules](/workflows#schedule) allows you to "schedule" a Workflow to start at a particular time.
Each execution of a Schedule accrues three actions:

- **Schedule Start**.
  This accounts for two actions.
- **Workflow started**.
  This is a single action to start the target Workflow.
  It includes initial Search Attributes as part of the start request.

**EXPORT**

[Workflow History Export](/cloud/export) enables you to export closed Workflow Histories to a cloud storage sink of your choice.

- **Workflow exported**.
  Each Workflow exported accrues a single action.

**TEMPORAL NEXUS**

- For Nexus Operation scheduled, the caller Workflow starting a Nexus Operation results in one Action on the caller Namespace.
- For Nexus Operation canceled, the caller Workflow canceling a Nexus Operation results in one Action on the caller Namespace.
- The underlying Temporal primitives (such as Workflows, Activities, and Signals) created by a Nexus Operation handler (directly or indirectly) result in the normal Actions for those primitives billed to the handler’s Namespace.
  This includes retries for underlying Temporal primitives like Activities but _not_ for handling the Nexus Operation itself or a retry of the Nexus Operation itself.

</Components.DiscoverableDisclosure>

[Reach out](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us) to our team for more information or to help size your number of Actions.

### Storage {#storage}

**How Workflow Storage works**

A Workflow's execution might exist for a few seconds, a day, month, or even forever.
The Temporal Service stores the Workflow Execution's [Event History](/workflows#event-history).
Under this framework, a Workflow Execution has only two states, open (Active Storage) or closed (Retained Storage).

- _Active Storage_ measures the amount of storage used by active Workflows.

- When the execution of a Workflow finishes, Temporal Cloud stores Event History for a defined Retention Period, which is set by the user per Namespace.
  This is _Retained Storage_.
  Typical uses of Retained Storage include compliance, debugging, workload refresh, and business analytics.
  When closed Workflow Histories need to be retained for more than the 90-day maximum period on Temporal Cloud, we recommend using our [**Export**](/cloud/export) feature.

Storage costs are measured in gigabyte-hours (GBh).

### Pricing options {#pricing-options}

**How to Pay for Temporal Cloud**

After you exceed your Actions and Storage allocations in your base tier, Temporal Cloud offers two payment options: Pay-As-You-Go and Commitments.
Both models meter and bill for three primary components: [Actions](#action), [Storage](#storage), and [your Temporal Cloud Plan](/cloud/support#support).

- With Pay-As-You-Go, you are invoiced each calendar month based on your consumption.
  Pay-As-You-Go pricing automatically applies volume prices as your Actions scale.
- With Commitments, you pre-purchase your Temporal Cloud spend with Temporal Credits.
  Temporal Credits pay for your Temporal Cloud consumption, including Temporal Cloud Plan charges.

## Pay-As-You-Go {#payg}

**How does Pay-As-You-Go pricing work?**

Pay-As-You-Go pricing is based on consumption.
This section explains how you're billed each calendar month and gives examples.

### Action pricing {#payg-action-pricing}

Actions pricing starts at &#36;50 per million Actions (&#36;0.00005 per Action).
You gain progressive volume discounts as you scale.
Discounts are based on your account's total usage, metered and billed for each calendar month:

| Actions               | Price per Million Actions                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First 5M              | &#36;50                                                                                   |
| Next 5M, up to 10M    | &#36;45                                                                                   |
| Next 10M, up to 20M   | &#36;40                                                                                   |
| Next 30M, up to 50M   | &#36;35                                                                                   |
| Next 50M, up to 100M  | &#36;30                                                                                   |
| Next 100M, up to 200M | &#36;25                                                                                   |
| Over 200M             | Contact [Sales](mailto:sales@temporal.io) for info<br /> _More discounts, helpful humans_ |

**Example**

If you consume 11.25M Actions in excess of your Temporal Cloud Plan allocation in one calendar month, your bill for Actions will be:

```
5M Actions ⨉ $50 Per Million Actions = $250
5M Actions ⨉ $45 Per Million Actions = $225
1.25M Actions ⨉ $40 Per Million Actions = $50
Actions
$250 (First Tier) + $225 (Second Tier) + $50 (Third Tier) = $525
```

### Storage pricing {#payg-storage-pricing}

Most accounts’ storage needs are met by our Temporal Cloud Plans.
For additional storage within a calendar month, you are billed for Active and Retained Storage as follows:
| **Storage** | **Price per GBh (USD)** |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Retained | &#36;0.00105 |
| Active | &#36;0.042 |

**Example**

If you have 720 GBh of Active Storage and 3,600 GBh of Retained Storage in excess of your Base Tier allocations in one calendar month, your bill will be:

```
720 GBh Active Storage ⨉ $0.042 per GBh = $30.24
3,600 GBh Retained Storage ⨉ $0.00105 per GBh = $3.78
Total Storage Bill: $30.24 Active Storage + $3.78 Retained Storage = $34.02
```

## Temporal Cloud Plan pricing

Your Temporal Cloud Plan pricing is the greater of the minimum monthly price or a percent (%) of your consumption spend:

- The Essentials tier is priced at the greater of &#36;100/month or 5% of your Temporal Cloud consumption.
- The Business tier is priced at the greater of &#36;500/month or 10% of Temporal Cloud consumption.
- The Enterprise and Mission Critical Support plans must be paid annually. Contact [Sales](mailto:sales@temporal.io) to discuss your needs.

Your Temporal Cloud consumption combines the costs of Actions and Storage.

**Example**

If you are signed up for Essentials, with &#36;3,000 of monthly spend, your bill will be:

```
Greater of $100 or 5% ⨉ $3,000 = $150, so $150.
```

## Commitment Pricing {#commitment-pricing}

**Commitments with Temporal Credits**

Temporal Cloud offers the option to commit to a minimum spend over a given timeframe.
In exchange for this commitment you receive additional discounts.
Key discount levers include:

- Account Action volume over 200M Actions
- Duration of your commitment (1, 2, or 3 years)

Meet your commitments with any Temporal Cloud spend, including Actions, Storage and your Temporal Cloud Plan.
After making a commitment, Temporal locks in your Actions price based on your expected volume and discounts your Active Storage costs.
This price is used to bill your Actions and Active Storage across your account for the timeframe specified in your commitment.

Commitments must be paid for with Temporal Credits.
Temporal Credits are used to pay your Temporal Cloud consumption, including Temporal Cloud Plan charges.
A Temporal Credit is equivalent to &#36;1 USD.
For example, a credit purchase of &#36;20,000 results in 20,000 Temporal Credits.
A minimum credit purchase equivalent to the first year of your commitment is required.
For multi-year deals please contact [Sales](mailto:sales@temporal.io) for the most accurate pricing.

### Commitment Pricing Q&A

**How do multi-year commitments work?**

Our sales team works with you to match annual credit purchases in line with your expected spend.
This aligns your payments to annual terms rather than one up-front expense.

**What happens if I exhaust my commitment-based Temporal Credits before the end of my term?**

You continue to receive the negotiated discounted prices for the remainder of your term.
You'll be invoiced for another credit purchase based on your most recent calendar month's spend.
This amount is multiplied by the months remaining in the annual portion of your term.
If your previous month spend was &#36;5,000, and you're 10 months through your annual term, you'll be invoiced for 10,000 Temporal Credits to cover the remaining two months.

**What happens if I have unused Temporal Credits at the end of my term?**

Commitments can be difficult to estimate.
Temporal Cloud offers two ways to roll-over unused credits:

- When you renew a commitment for the same or larger amount, Temporal Cloud rolls over any unused credits into your new commitment.
- Should you need to downsize your commitment, Temporal Cloud rolls over up to 10% of your initial credit purchase amount into the new commitment.

**How do I make a commitment and purchase Temporal Credits?**

Contact our team at [sales@temporal.io](mailto:sales@temporal.io) or reach out to your dedicated account manager.
You can also purchase Temporal Cloud commitments credits through [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-hbcjz7wcl2mvu).

### Credit Balance

Your Credit Balance is adjusted each calendar month based on your Credit Usage.

**Example**

An account has purchased credits with an annual spend commitment of &#36;72,000.
In the first calendar month, the account is billed &#36;500 for a Business plan, &#36;5,000 for Actions, &#36;250 for Active Storage and &#36;50 for Retained Storage, a total of &#36;5800.
Their invoice would state:

```
Beginning credit balance of 72,000 - 5800 credits used = 66,200, Temporal Credits remaining.
```

If you have additional questions about credits and volume-based pricing, please contact [sales](mailto:sales@temporal.io) or, if you're already a Temporal Cloud customer, reach out to your dedicated account executive.

## Other pricing {#other-pricing}

Temporal Cloud has additional pricing for other elements of the platform.
Following are additional pricing considerations for High Availability features and SSO/SAML.

### High Availability feature pricing {#high-availability-features}

**How does the pricing for High Availability (HA) features work?**

For workloads with stringent high availability requirements, Temporal Cloud provides same-region and multi-region replicas, which add a failover capability.
Enabling HA features for Namespace automatically replicates Workflow Execution data and metadata to a replica in the same region or in a different region.
This allows for a near-seamless failover when incidents or outages occur.

The pricing for High Availability features aligns with the volume of your workloads.
Actions and Storage in your Namespace contribute to your Actions and Storage consumption.
To estimate costs for this deployment model, apply a 2x multiplier to the Actions and Storage in the Namespace you are replicating and include this scaling in your account’s consumption.

:::tip Future Pricing Update

To align with cloud provider network traffic pricing, we are introducing adjustments for multi-region replication.
Your plan will include a generous base allocation, with additional pay-per-use charges for any network usage beyond that threshold.
Most multi-region customers will not be impacted by this change.

:::

When upgrading an existing Namespace, some points to consider:

- Temporal won't charge for historical Actions completed prior to upgrading to a Namespace with High Availability features.
  Only ongoing (in-flight) and new Workflow Executions will generate consumption.
- Temporal charges for all Actions of existing (ongoing) and new Workflows from the point of adding a replica.
- Temporal charges for Replicated Storage of retained (historical), running (ongoing), and new Workflow Executions from the point of adding a new replica.

### SSO via SAML pricing {#sso-and-saml}

**What costs are associated with SSO/SAML use?**

Single sign-on (SSO) integration using SAML is included for all customers on the Enterprise and Mission Critical Plans.
For business plan customers, a monthly fixed fee based on the number of users registered in Temporal Cloud is required:

| **Users** | **Cost per month** |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 0 to 25   | &#36;200           |
| 26 to 50  | &#36;300           |
| 51+       | &#36;500           |

**What costs are associated with SCIM?**

To enable SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), you need an Enterprise or Mission Critical plan.
Please note that you must configure SSO via SAML to use SCIM.

:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

SCIM support is available in [Pre-release](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#pre-release).

:::


### Use case cost estimates {#pricing-estimates}

Temporal Cloud uses a consumption-based pricing model based primarily on [Actions](#action) and [Storage](#storage).
Each workload is different.
You can estimate the cost of a specific Workflow by running it at a low volume.
Use the resulting Storage and compute measurements to project your production scale cost.

The examples below provide general estimates based on workload size.
You can also use our calculator on the pricing page to build your estimate.
Our team is always happy to [help you estimate costs] (https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us) for your specific workloads and requirements.

| Workload size | Cost (monthly) | Characteristics                            | Actions                                            | Typical use cases                                                                                             |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
