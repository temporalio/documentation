The operating envelope of Temporal Cloud includes throughput, latency, and limits.
Service regions are listed on [this page](/cloud/regions).
If you need more details, [contact us](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us).

## Throughput expectations {#throughput}

**What kind of throughput can I get with Temporal Cloud?**

Each Namespace in Temporal has a rate limit, which is measured in [Actions](/cloud/pricing#action) per second. 
Temporal offers two different modes for adjusting capacity: On-Demand Capacity or Provisioned Capacity.
With On-Demand Capacity, Namespace capacity is increased automatically along with usage.
With Provisioned Capacity, you can control your capacity limits by requesting Temporal Resource Units (TRUs).

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

Provisioned Capacity is currently in [pre-release](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#pre-release). 
Please contact your AE or Support to enable this feature.

## Latency Service Level Objective (SLO) {#latency}

**What kind of latency can I expect from Temporal Cloud?**

Temporal Cloud has a p99 latency SLO of 200ms per region.

The same SLO for normal Worker requests (commands and polling) apply to Nexus in both the caller and handler Namespaces.

### Historical latency data

Latency over a week-long period for starting and signaling Workflow Executions was as follows:

#### January 2026

| Operation                          |  p50   | p90  |  p99 |
| :--------------------------------- | :----: | :--: | ---: |
| `StartWorkflowExecution`           | 14ms | 21ms | 69ms |
| `SignalWorkflowExecution`          | 11ms | 19ms | 46ms |
| `SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution` | 19ms | 37ms | 95ms |

#### March 2024

| Operation                          | p90  |  p99 |
| :--------------------------------- | :--: | ---: |
| `StartWorkflowExecution`           | 24ms | 54ms |
| `SignalWorkflowExecution`          | 14ms | 40ms |
| `SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution` | 24ms | 61ms |

Latency observed from the Temporal Client is influenced by other system components like the Codec Server, egress proxy, and the network itself.
Also, concurrent operations on the same Workflow Execution may result in higher latency.
