Temporal Cloud offers developers a hassle-free way to leverage the power of Temporal without the operational overhead. Here's what you get:

- Scalability: Start small and grow seamlessly. Handles anything from modest workloads to 100B+ actions/month.
- Reliability: 99.99% uptime guarantee, with automatic updates and maintenance.
- Security: Built-in encryption and compliance (SOC2, HIPAA), saving you time on security implementations.
- Cost-effective: Often more economical than self-hosting, especially when factoring in operational costs.
- Expertise on tap: Built and supported by Temporal's core team, ensuring you're always running an optimized setup.
- Focus on development: Spend your time building Workflows, not managing infrastructure.

**Importantly, it does not execute your code directly.** Users of Temporal Cloud must have their own environment to run Temporal Applications.
