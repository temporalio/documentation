You can access Temporal Cloud from anywhere with Internet connectivity, no matter where your Temporal Cloud Namespaces are physically located.
Your applications can live in the cloud environment or data center of your choice.
With that in mind, you _will_ reduce latency by creating  Namespaces in a region close to where you host your Workers.

This page enumerates the current regions supported by Temporal Cloud Namespaces.

:::caution

- While GCP Namespaces support Multi-region Replication, they do not support Same-region Replication.
- You cannot use Multi-region Replication across services.
  Both regions must co-exist within the same provider.
