**What is Temporal Cloud's Service Level Agreement? SLA?**

Temporal Cloud provides two availability levels: the [service availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability,_availability_and_serviceability) and the contractual [service level agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement) (SLA).
These levels are set by your deployment mode:

- **Temporal Cloud with standard single-region deployment**:
  Standard Temporal Cloud deployment provides 99.99% availability and a contractual service level agreement (SLA) of 99.9% guarantee against service errors.
- **Temporal Cloud with multi-region Namespace deployment**:
  Temporal Cloud Namespaces that use the multi-region feature provide 99.99% availability and contractual service level agreement (SLA) of 99.99% guarantee against service errors.

The same SLA for normal Worker requests (commands and polling) apply to Nexus in both the caller and handler Namespaces.

To calculate the service-error rate, Temporal Cloud captures all requests that arrive in a Namespace during a five-minute interval.
We record the number of gRPC service errors that occurred.
For each Namespace, we calculate the service-error rate as 1 - (count of errors / count of requests).
Rates are averaged per month and reset quarterly.

Errors are recorded against the SLA are service errors, such as the `UNAVAILABLE` [gRPC status code](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html).
The following errors are _not_ counted against the SLA:

- `ClientVersionNotSupported`
- `InvalidArgument`
- `NamespaceAlreadyExists`
- `NamespaceInvalidState`
- `NamespaceNotActive`
- `NamespaceNotFound`
- `NotFound`
- `PermissionDenied`
- `QueryFailed`
- `RetryReplication`
- `StickyWorkerUnavailable`
- `TaskAlreadyStarted`
- `Throttling (resources exhausted; triggers retry)`
- `WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStarted`
- `WorkflowNotReady`

Our internal alerting system is based on a [service level objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective) (SLO) for all errors, not just errors that count against the SLA.
When we receive an alert that an SLO is not being met, we page our on-call engineers, which often means that issues are resolved before they become noticeable.

Internally, our components are distributed across a minimum of three availability zones per region.
We implement a cell architecture.
Each cell contains the software and services necessary to host a Namespace.
Within each cell, the components are distributed across a minimum of three availability zones per region.
