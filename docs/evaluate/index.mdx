## How does Temporal work?

Temporal provides durable execution for your applications through its unique architecture. Write your business logic as Workflows and Activities, deploy them to Workers, and let Temporal handle the rest.

## What programming languages are supported?

Temporal allows you to develop with durable execution in different languages and multiple languages can be used to build single services, enabling polyglot development.
