## Pre-release {#pre-release}

**Access:** Most Pre-release features are released in the open source Temporal software and are publicly available.
However, some features which are explicit to hosting Temporal Services, such as [API Keys](/cloud/api-keys), may be specific to Temporal Cloud.

In Temporal Cloud, Pre-release features are invite-only: Temporal will work directly with a group of existing Temporal Cloud customers to be part of testing of each Pre-release feature.
These customers are invited to provide feedback to the Temporal team.

**Classification:** New features in Pre-release may not be fully mature and may have bugs.
Users acknowledge and agree that Pre-release features are provided on an “as-is” basis, and that they are provided without any indemnification, support, warranties, or representation of any kind.

**Feedback:** Feedback is highly encouraged and important for guiding Temporal feature development.
We encourage you to share your experience so that you can influence the future direction of Temporal.

**Availability:** Temporal may modify features before they become Generally Available, or may even decide to remove them.
This means there is no guarantee that a new feature will become Generally Available.
A Pre-release feature can be deprecated at any time.

Pre-release features may be disabled by default, and can be enabled via configuration.
Temporal Cloud customers can contact the Temporal account team or [Temporal Support Team](/cloud/support#support-ticket) to gain Pre-release access.

## Public Preview {#public-preview}

**Access:** New features in Public preview are available to everyone.

**Classification:** Features in public preview may undergo further development and testing before they are made Generally Available.
These features are being refined and are recommended for production usage.

**Feedback:** Temporal users are invited to share feedback via the [Community Slack](http://t.mp/slack), by reaching out directly to the Temporal team at product@temporal.io, or by creating issues in the relevant [GitHub repository](https://github.com/temporalio).
Temporal also encourages Temporal Cloud users to submit feedback via [support ticket](/cloud/support#support-ticket).
This feedback will assist in guiding the improvements for General Availability.

**Availability:** New Features in Public Preview may evolve.
The APIs may undergo changes; however, Temporal's goal is to maintain backward compatibility.

## General Availability {#general-availability}

**Access:** Features in General Availability are available to everyone.

**Classification:** The feature is now fully developed, tested, and available for use without further anticipated changes.

**Feedback:** Temporal users are invited to share feedback via the [Community Slack](http://t.mp/slack), by reaching out directly to the Temporal team at product@temporal.io, or by creating issues in the relevant [GitHub repository](https://github.com/temporalio).

**Availability:** Features in General Availability are released with stable APIs and recommended for production use with a committed SLA.

:::info Exceptions

There may be exceptions for different features, but this is the typical expectation.
