A **Temporal Client** is a component available in each Temporal SDK that provides a set of APIs to communicate with a Temporal Service.
Use a Temporal Client in your HTTP gateway, existing service, or application.
It enables you to perform various operations such as:

- Start a business process.
- Get the result of a business process.
- List business processes or entities.
- Query the state of your business process.
- Send data into a running business process.
