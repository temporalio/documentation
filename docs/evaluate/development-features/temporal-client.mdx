A Temporal Client is a component available in each Temporal SDK that provides a set of APIs to communicate with a Temporal Service.
Use a Temporal Client in your HTTP gateway, existing service, or application to interact with the Temporal Service.
It enables you to perform various operations such as:

- Starting a Workflow Execution.
- Getting the result of Workflow Execution.
- Listing Workflow Executions.
- Querying a Workflow Execution.
- Signaling a Workflow Execution.
