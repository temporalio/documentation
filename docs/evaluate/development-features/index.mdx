Through a Temporal SDK, Temporal provides a wide range of features that enable developers to build applications that serve a wide range of use cases.

- **[Core application primitives](/evaluate/development-features/core-application)**: Develop and run your application with Workflows, Activities, and Workers.
- **Testing suite**: Each Temporal SDK comes with a testing suite that enables developers to test their applications as they would any other.
- **[Temporal Clients](/evaluate/development-features/temporal-client)**: Communicate with the Temporal Service to start your application, send it messages, cancel a business process (Workflow), and more.
- **Scheduled Workflows**: Start a business process (Workflow) at a specific time or on a given time interval.
- **Cancellation**: Cancel a business process (Workflow) that is already in progress and compensate for any steps already taken.
- **Runtime safeguards**: Prevent avoidable errors and issues from executing during runtime.
- **Failure detection and mitigation**: Detect failures with timeouts and configure automatic retries to mitigate them.
- **Messages**: Send data into or get the state of your running application.
- **Versioning**: Support multiple versions of your business logic for long-running business processes (Workflows).
- **Observability**: List business process (Workflows), view their state, and setup dashboards with metrics.
- **Debugging**: Surface errors and step through code to find issues.
- **Data encryption**: Transform data and protect the privacy of the users of your application.
- **[Throughput composability](/evaluate/development-features/throughput-composability)**: Breakup business processes (Workflows) by data streams, team ownership, or other organization factors.
