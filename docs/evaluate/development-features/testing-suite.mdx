In the context of Temporal, you can create these types of automated tests:

1. End-to-end: Running a Temporal Server and Worker with all its Workflows and Activities; starting and interacting with Workflows from a Client.
2. Integration: Anything between end-to-end and unit testing.
   Running Activities with mocked Context and other SDK imports (and usually network requests).
   Running Workers with mock Activities, and using a Client to start Workflows.
   Running Workflows with mocked SDK imports.
3. Unit: Running a piece of Workflow or Activity code and mocking any code it calls.
