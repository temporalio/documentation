Integrating Signals and Queries is an essential skill to build responsive applications. Signals allow Workflows to react to events at runtime, while Queries enable on-demand data retrieval from ongoing Workflows without disrupting their execution.

**Signals**: Signals allow you to send messages asynchronously to running Workflow Executions, enabling you to change their state and control their flow in real-time. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where Workflows must react to external events or user interactions.

**Queries**: Queries provide a way to access and monitor the internal state of your Workflow Executions in real-time. This is essential for monitoring the progress of long-running Workflows and retrieving their results.
