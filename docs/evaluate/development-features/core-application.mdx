**Workflows**, **Activities**, and **Workers** form the core parts of a Temporal Application.

**Workflows**: A Workflow defines the overall flow of the application.
You write it in your programming language of choice using the Temporal SDK.
Conceptually, a Workflow specifies a sequence of steps and orchestrates the execution of Activities.

**Activities**: An Activity is a method or function that encapsulates business logic prone to failure (e.g., calling a service that may go down).
The system can automatically retry these Activities upon some failures.
Activities perform a single, well-defined action, such as calling another service, transcoding a media file, or sending an email message.

**Workers**: A Worker executes your Workflow and Activity code.

**Follow one of our tutorials to [Get started](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/) learning how to develop Workflows and Activities and run them in Worker Processes.**
