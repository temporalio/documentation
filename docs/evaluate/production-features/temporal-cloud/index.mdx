[Temporal Cloud](https://temporal.io/cloud) a software-as-a-service (SaaS) infrastructure platform designed to manage the durability of your Temporal Applications.
Temporal Cloud doesn't execute your code.
Temporal Cloud oversees and manages the execution process for your production evironments for your distributed applications and services.
It provides durable execution, allowing failable processes to be retried, and capturing progress so that your Workflows execute reliably, recoverably, and performantly.

Temporal Cloud features include:

- [High Availability](/evaluate/production-features/temporal-cloud/high-availability): Add push-button high availability to your Temporal Cloud Service with multi-region Namespaces (MRN).
  MRNs provide seamless failover capabilities to your production work, ensuring continuous reliable operation.
  
We handle the operations of running the Temporal Service. 
You focus on your application.
See the [Temporal Cloud guide](/cloud) to get started.
