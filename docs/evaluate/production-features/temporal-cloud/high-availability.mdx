Temporal Cloud offers disaster-tolerant deployment for workloads with stringent availability requirements.
With the multi-region feature enabled, Temporal Cloud automates [failover](/glossary#failover] and synchronizes data between Namespace regions.

This page introduces Temporal Cloud patterns that support your workload's availability requirements.

## Multi-region Namespaces

Multi-region Namespaces provide failover capabilities to mitigate service outages due to regional failures.
They reduce risk and minimize operational disruption.
This feature seamlessly shif​​ts Workflow execution between regions to maintain service availability.

Your Clients use a single logical Namespace with a single endpoint that operates in two physical regions: one active and one standby.
As Workflows progress in the active region, history events asynchronously replicate to the standby region.
Data replication ensures both regions are in sync so the standby is ready to take over when needed.

Should an incident or outage occur in the active region, Temporal Cloud initiates a "failover" to the standby region.
During a failover, the roles of the active and standby regions reverse.
The standby takes over as the primary region.

### Advantages of multi-region Namespaces {#multi-region-advantages}

**Why choose multi-region Namespaces?**

* **Reduce Risk**:
  MRN's protects your operations from unexpected regional outages.
  Its automated disaster recovery features ensure that workloads remain available and continue execution.
* **Minimize Operational Disruption**:
  Seamless failovers shift Workflow Executions to a secondary region during outages.
  MRNs maintain service availability without needing manual synchronization between Namespaces.
  Real-time alerts during failover events keep you informed.
* **No manual deployment or configuration needed**.
  Temporal Cloud simplifies deployment with push-button operation.
  This eliminates the need for manual deployment or configuration.
* **Fault tolerance**.
  Your open Workflows continue their progress in the standby region.
  This minimizes interruption and data loss during regional failures.
* **No code changes**.
  Your Workers and Workflow starter code don't need updates to take advantage of multi-region setup or to respond to failover conditions.
  This allows for a smooth transition and continued operation.

### Service Level Objectives (SLO) and guarantees {#multi-region-SLO}

**What reliability promises does this feature offer?**

* Temporal provides a 99.99% Contractual SLA that provides redress in the event of downtime ([SLA](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla)).
* [RTO](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/recovery_time_objective): 20 minutes or less.
* [RPO](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/recovery_point_objective): Near zero.

### Target workloads {#target-workloads}

**Who benefits from this feature?**

Multi-region Namespaces are a great solution for Workloads where a regional cloud outage would cause:

* Revenue loss
* Poor customer experience
* Problems stemming from policy/legal requirements that demand high availability

Some examples: financial services, e-commerce, gaming, global SaaS platforms, bookings & reservations, delivery & shipping, order management.

## Single-region Namespaces

A typical Temporal Cloud Namespace is deployed into one [AWS region](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/service-availability).
Temporal Cloud provides [99.99% availability](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla) and a contractual [service level agreement](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla) (SLA) of 99.9% guarantee against service errors.
It provides a great all-around solution that's suitable for most organizations.

### Advantages of single-region Namespaces {#single-region-advantages}

**Why choose single-region Namespaces?**

* This option offers sufficient availability for most use cases and workloads.
* Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% availability and a contractual service level agreement of 99.9% guarantee against service errors.
  Read more on our [SLA page](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla).

Note: Some downsides of single-region Namespaces compared to multi-region Namespaces:

* Stalled work during failures: Open Workflow Executions pause until the region/Namespace recovers.
* Blocked work initiation: No new Workflow Executions will start until the region/Namespace recovers.
