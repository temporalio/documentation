Add push-button high availability for your Temporal Service with [multi-region Namespaces](/cloud/namespaces).<!--/cloud/namespaces/multi-region-->
They provide seamless failover capabilities to your production work, ensuring continuous reliable operation.

## High Availability

*What are the advantages of opting into High Availability?*

Availability issues can lead to:

* Financial losses
* Downtime
* Customer satisfaction decrease
* Reputation risks, customer churn
* Compromisation of data integrity and security
* Regulatory non-compliance
* Low productivity

Avoid these by opting into Temporal Cloud's highest level of availability.

## Features

*What are the stand-out features of High Availability for Temporal Cloud?*

### Active and standby regions

100% of traffic is sent to your one active region.
You provision a standby namespace in a second region as a backup.
The standby stores replicated Workload Execution data and metadata in sync with the active region.

With High Availability you avoid complex setup, high cost, and stalled workflows in the active region during failure.

### Single Namespace

Temporal clients connect to a single namespace in a single AWS region.

With High Availability you avoid stalled workflows during recovery and blocked workflow initiation during downtime.


## Multi-region Namespaces

*What are multi-region Namespaces*?

A high availability multi-region Namespace (MRN) provides a single endpoint for a multi-region service.
This option offers a single logical Namespace that runs in two physical regions, one active and one standby.
As Workflows progress in the active region, history events are asynchronously replicated to the standby region.

In case of an incident or outage in the active region, Temporal Cloud will "failover" to the standby region.
A failover means to switch the roles of the active and standby regions.
These failovers enable existing Workflow Executions to keep running and new Executions to be initiated.

In the traditional definition of active/active replication, multiple nodes serve requests and accept writes simultaneously with strong synchronous data consistency.
A Temporal Cloud multi-region Namespace enables two replicated Namespaces (one active, one standby) to accept requests, but not simultaneously.
Requests are accepted, and Workflow history events are written to the active region and then asynchronously replicated to the standby region.

For a single-region Namespace, Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% availability and its contractual service level agreement ([SLA](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla)) offers a 99.9% guarantee against service errors.
For many applications, this provides sufficient availability.
With this strategy, Temporal clients connect to a single Namespace in one deployment region.
This approach works well for workloads that don't require stringent availability guarantees.

A multi-region Namespace supports standby recovery.
To enable this feature, simply add an additional region to a Namespace.
Temporal Cloud takes care of the Namespace replication to your new standby region.
In the event of a regional failure, Temporal Cloud automatically fails over the Namespace to the secondary region. 
When faced with network latency or other region-wide issues, you can manually trigger a failover.


## The High Availability Advantage

*Explore the advantages of High Availability*

Advantages of using a Multi-region Namespace:

* No manual deployment or configuration needed, simple push button operation.
* Fault tolerant. Open workflows continue in the standby region with minimal interruption and data loss.
* No changes required to workers and workflow starter code in setup and failover.
* 99.99% Contractual service level agreement.
