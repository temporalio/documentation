Multi-region Namespaces add push-button **high availability** for your Temporal Service with multi-region Namespaces.
They enable seamless failover capabilities for your production work, ensuring continuous reliable operation.

Each multi-region Temporal Cloud Namespace enables you to choose a standby region.
The service handles the complexity of replicating data from the active region to the standby region and transferring control to the standby region when needed.
This means your standby region is available and in sync with the active region.

In the event of network service and performance issues in the active region, the standby region is ready to take over.
This feature provides Temporal Cloud's highest levels of service availability.

## Why choose a multi-region Namespace?

A high availability multi-region Namespace (MRN) provides a single endpoint for a multi-region service.
This option offers a single logical Namespace that runs in two physical regions, one active and one standby.
As Workflows progress in the active region, history events are asynchronously replicated to the standby region.

In case of an incident or outage in the active region, Temporal Cloud will "failover" to the standby region.
A failover means to switch the roles of the active and standby regions.
These failovers enable existing Workflow Executions to keep running and new Executions to be initiated.

In the traditional definition of active/active replication, multiple nodes serve requests and accept writes simultaneously with strong synchronous data consistency.
A Temporal Cloud multi-region Namespace enables two replicated Namespaces (one active, one standby) to accept requests, but not simultaneously.
Requests are accepted, and Workflow history events are written to the active region and then asynchronously replicated to the standby region.

For a single-region Namespace, Temporal Cloud provides 99.99% availability and its contractual service level agreement ([SLA](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/sla)) offers a 99.9% guarantee against service errors.
For many applications, this provides sufficient availability.
With this strategy, Temporal clients connect to a single Namespace in one deployment region.
This approach works well for workloads that don't require stringent availability guarantees.

A multi-region Namespace supports standby recovery.
To enable this feature, simply add an additional region to a Namespace.
Temporal Cloud takes care of the Namespace replication to your new standby region.
In the event of a regional failure, Temporal Cloud automatically fails over the Namespace to the secondary region. 
When faced with network latency or other region-wide issues, you can manually trigger a failover.

Advantages of using a Multi-region Namespace:

* No manual deployment or configuration needed, simple push button operation.
* Open workflows continue in the standby region with minimal interruption and data loss.
* No changes required to workers and workflow starter code in setup and failover.
* 99.99% Contractual SLA.
