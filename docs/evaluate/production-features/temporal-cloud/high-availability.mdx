Add push-button high availability for your Temporal Service with [multi-region Namespaces](/cloud/namespaces).<!--/cloud/namespaces/multi-region-->
They provide seamless failover capabilities to your production work, ensuring continuous reliable operation.

## High Availability

*What are the advantages of opting into High Availability?*

Availability issues can lead to:

* Financial losses
* Downtime
* Customer satisfaction decrease
* Reputation risks, customer churn
* Compromisation of data integrity and security
* Regulatory non-compliance
* Low productivity

Avoid these by opting into Temporal Cloud's highest level of availability.

## Features

*What are the stand-out features of High Availability for Temporal Cloud?*

### Active and standby regions

100% of traffic is sent to your one active region.
You provision a standby namespace in a second region as a backup.
The standby stores replicated Workload Execution data and metadata in sync with the active region.

With High Availability you avoid complex setup, high cost, and stalled workflows in the active region during failure.

### Single Namespace

Temporal clients connect to a single namespace in a single AWS region.

With High Availability you avoid stalled workflows during recovery and blocked workflow initiation during downtime.


### Multi-region Namespaces

A high availability multi-region Namespace (MRN) provides a single endpoint for a multi-region service.
This offers a single logical Namespace that runs in two physical regions, one active and one standby.
As Workflows progress in the active region, history events are asynchronously replicated to the standby region.
In case of an incident or outage in the active region, Temporal Cloud will "failover" to the standby region.
A failover means to switch the roles of the active and standby regions.

## Advantages of using a Multi-region Namespace:

* No manual deployment or configuration needed, simple push button operation.
* Fault tolerant. Open workflows continue in the standby region with minimal interruption and data loss.
* No changes required to workers and workflow starter code in setup and failover.
* 99.99% Contractual service level agreement.
