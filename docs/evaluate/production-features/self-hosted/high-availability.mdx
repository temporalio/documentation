- [Global Namespace](/namespaces#global-namespace):
  A Namespace that exists across Temporal Services to enhance your Namespace availability to higher levels.
  A global Namespace automatically replicates metadata and Workflow Execution state from an active Temporal Service to a standby Temporal Service.
  In the case of operational issues, a [failover](/glossary#failover) allows responsibility to pass from the active to the standby Temporal Service.
