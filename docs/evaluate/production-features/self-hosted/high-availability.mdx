A Global Namespace is a Namespace that exists across Clusters.
It uses Multi-Cluster Replication to automatically replicate metadata and Workflow state from an active Cluster to a standby Cluster.
In the case of operational issues, a failover allows responsibility to pass from the active to the standby Cluster.
This automatic approach, where there's always one or more standby Clusters waiting to take over, is called **High Availability**.

A Global Namespace may be replicated to any number of Clusters, but is active in only one Cluster at any given time.

For a failover to be successful, Worker Processes must be polling for Tasks for the Global Namespace on all Clusters.

A Global Namespace has a failover version.
Because a failover can be triggered from any Cluster, the failover version prevents certain conflicts from occurring if a failover is mistakenly triggered simultaneously on two Clusters.

Only the active Cluster dispatches Tasks; however, certain conflicts are possible.
Unlike regular Namespaces, which provide at-most-once semantics for an Activity Execution, Global Namespaces can support only at-least-once semantics (see Conflict resolution).
Worker Processes on the standby Clusters are idle until a failover occurs and their Cluster becomes active.

Temporal Application API calls made to a non-active Cluster are rejected with a NamespaceNotActiveError which contains the name of the current active Cluster.
It is the responsibility of the Temporal Application to call the Cluster that is currently active.
