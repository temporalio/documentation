Sending a Signal from within a Workflow is often referred to as sending an External Signal.

The [SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/docs/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated) Event appears in the Workflow Execution Event History of the Workflow that sent the Signal, and the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/docs/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.
