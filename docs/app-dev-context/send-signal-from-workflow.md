When a Signal is sent from within a Workflow it is often referred to as sending an External Signal.

You will see the [SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/docs/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated) Event in the Workflow Execution Event History of the Workflow that sent the Signal, and the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/docs/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.
