An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster.
Each ping informs the Temporal Cluster that the Activity Execution is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.

Activity Heartbeats work in conjunction with a [Heartbeat Timeout](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout).
