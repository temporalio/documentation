The call to spawn an [Activity Execution](/docs/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution) generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-command/#scheduleactivitytask) Command and provides the Workflow with an Awaitable.
Workflow Executions can either block progress until the result is available via the Awaitable or continue progressing, making use of the result when it becomes available.
