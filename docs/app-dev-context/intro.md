It is broken down into five large sections:

- [Foundations](#foundations): The minimum things required to build and run a simple Workflow with a single Activity.
- [Features](#features): All of the general features available to a Temporal Application.
- [Observability](#observability): Features and tools available that give you insight into you application.
- [Testing](#testing): How to test your Temporal Application code.
- [Scaling](#scaling): Things to consider and look for when scaling a Temporal Application to millions or billions of Workflow Executions.
