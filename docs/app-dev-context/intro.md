This guide is meant to be a comprehensive resource for developing a [Temporal Application](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-application).

It is broken down into four large sections:

- [Foundations](#application-foundations): The minimum things required to build and run a simple Workflow with a single Activity.
- [Features](#application-features): All of the general features available to a Temporal Application.
- [Analysis](#application-analysis): Features and tools available that give you insight into you application.
- [Scaling](#application-scaling): Things to consider and look for when scaling a Temporal Application to millions or billions of Workflow Executions.
