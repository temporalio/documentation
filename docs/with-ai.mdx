# Use These Docs with AI

Connect Temporal documentation directly to your AI assistant for accurate, up-to-date answers about Temporal.
The Temporal docs MCP server gives AI tools real-time access to our documentation, so responses draw from current docs rather than training data.

The server requires anonymous authentication using any Google account to enforce rate limits and prevent abuse.
We cannot see nor do we collect any contact information from this.

## Claude Code

Add the Temporal docs MCP server to Claude Code with a single command:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http temporal-docs https://temporal.mcp.kapa.ai
```

This adds the server globally so it's available in all your projects.

To add it to a specific project only (stored in `.mcp.json`):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http temporal-docs https://temporal.mcp.kapa.ai
```

After adding, restart Claude Code and run `/mcp` to authenticate with your Google account.

## Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop settings
2. Navigate to **Settings > Connectors**
3. Add a new MCP server with the URL: `https://temporal.mcp.kapa.ai`

## Other MCP-compatible tools

For any tool that supports the Model Context Protocol, use the following server URL:

```
https://temporal.mcp.kapa.ai
```

Configuration format varies by tool. Here's a generic JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "temporal-docs": {
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "https://temporal.mcp.kapa.ai"
    }
  }
}
```
