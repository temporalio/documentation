# Use These Docs with AI

Connect Temporal documentation directly to your AI assistant for accurate, up-to-date answers about Temporal.
The Temporal docs MCP server gives AI tools real-time access to our documentation, so responses draw from current docs rather than training data.

## Claude Code

Add the Temporal docs MCP server to Claude Code with a single command:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http temporal-docs https://temporal.mcp.kapa.ai
```

This adds the server globally so it's available in all your projects.

To add it to a specific project only (stored in `.mcp.json`):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http temporal-docs https://temporal.mcp.kapa.ai
```

After adding, restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect.

## Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop settings
2. Navigate to **Settings > Connectors**
3. Add a new MCP server with the URL: `https://temporal.mcp.kapa.ai`

## Other MCP-compatible tools

For any tool that supports the Model Context Protocol, use the following server URL:

```
https://temporal.mcp.kapa.ai
```

Configuration format varies by tool. Here's a generic JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "temporal-docs": {
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "https://temporal.mcp.kapa.ai"
    }
  }
}
```
