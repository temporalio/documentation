The Temporal Web UI provides users with Workflow Execution state and metadata for debugging purposes.
It ships with every [Temporal CLI](/cli) release and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) update and is available with [Temporal Cloud](/cloud).

You can configure the Temporal Web UI to work in your own environment.
See the [UI configuration reference](/references/web-ui-configuration).

Web UI open source repos:

- [temporalio/ui](https://github.com/temporalio/ui)
- [temporalio/ui-server](https://github.com/temporalio/ui-server)

The Web UI is packed with several features.

### Namespaces

All Namespaces in your self-hosted Cluster or Temporal Cloud account are listed under **Namespaces** in the left section of the window.
You can also switch Namespaces from the Workflows view by selecting from the Namespace switcher at the top right corner of the window.
After you select a Namespace, the Web UI shows the Recent Workflows page for that Namespace.
In Temporal Cloud, users can access only the Namespaces that they have been granted access to.
For details, see [Namespace-level permissions](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions).

### Recent Workflows

The main Workflows page displays a table of recent Workflow Executions.
The Web UI displays a maximum of 1,000 Workflow Executions.

Users can list Workflow Executions by any of the following:

- Status
- [Workflow ID](/workflows#workflow-id)
- [Workflow Type](/workflows#workflow-type)
- Start time
- End time
- A [List Filter](/visibility#list-filter)

For start time and end time, users can set their preferred date and time format as one of the following:

- UTC
- Local
- Relative

Select a Workflow Execution to view the Workflow Execution's History, Workers, and pending Activities.

#### History

This is a view of the [Events](/workflows#event) and Event fields within the Workflow Execution.
Approximately [40 different Events](/references/events) can appear in a Workflow Execution's Event History.

The top of the page lists the following execution metadata:

- [Workflow Type](/workflows#workflow-type)
- [Run ID](/workflows#run-id)
- Start Time and Close Time
- [Task Queue](/workers#task-queue)
- Parent and Parent ID
- [State Transitions](/workflows#state-transition)

The Input and Results section displays the function arguments and return values for debugging purposes.
Results are not available until the Workflow finishes.

The Recent Events tab has the following views:

- Timeline: A chronological or reverse-chronological order of events with a summary.
  Clicking into an Event displays all details for that Event.
  Clicking “Expand all” displays all Event details.
  Similarly, clicking “Collapse all” collapses the table and displays only the summary.
- Compact: A logical grouping of Activities, Signals and Timers.
- JSON: The full JSON code for the workflow.

#### Download Event History

The entire Workflow Execution Event History, in JSON format, can be downloaded from this section.

#### Terminate Workflow

Workflow Executions can be Terminated directly from the UI.
A custom note can be logged from the UI when that happens.

#### Workers

Displays the Workers currently polling on the Workflow Task Queue with a count.
If no Workers are polling, an error displays.

#### Pending Activities

Displays a summary of recently active and/or pending Activity Executions.
Clicking a pending Activity directs the user to the Pending Activities tab to view details.

#### Call Stack

The screen shows the captured result from the [\_\_stack_trace](/workflows#stack-trace-query) Query.
The Query is performed when the tab is selected.
It works only if a Worker is running and available to return the call stack. The call stack shows each location where Workflow code is waiting.

#### Queries

Lists all Queries sent to the Workflow Execution.

### Schedules

On Temporal Cloud and self-hosted Temporal Cluster Web UI, the Schedules page lists all the [Schedules](/workflows#schedule) created on the selected Namespace.

Click a Schedule to see details, such as configured frequency, start and end times, and recent and upcoming runs.

### Settings

On Temporal Cloud, **Settings** is visible only to [Global Admins](/cloud/users#account-level-roles).

Click **Settings** to see and manage the list of users in your account and to set up integrations such as [Observability](/cloud/metrics) and [Audit logging](/cloud/audit-logging).

On self-hosted Temporal Clusters, manage your users, metrics, and logging in your [server configuration](/references/configuration).

### Archive

On self-hosted Temporal Clusters, Archive shows [Archived](/clusters#archival) data of your Workflow Executions on the Namespace.

To see data in your self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you must have [Archival set up and configured](/self-hosted-guide/archival).

For information and details on the Archive feature in Temporal Cloud, contact your Temporal representative.

### Codec Server

The Web UI can use a [Codec Server](/dataconversion#codec-server) with a custom Data Converter to decode inputs and return values.
For details, see [Securing your data](/production-deployment/data-encryption).

The UI supports a [Codec Server endpoint](/production-deployment/data-encryption#web-ui).
For details on setting the Codec Server endpoint, see [Codec Server setup](/production-deployment/data-encryption#codec-server-setup).

### Labs mode

The Web UI provides a "labs" mode for users to try out upcoming, production-ready UI features and improvements.
When off, users will experience the current UI.
Features will move in and out of labs mode according to demand and feedback.
Labs mode can be turned on or off at any time in the left navigation bar via the Labs icon.
