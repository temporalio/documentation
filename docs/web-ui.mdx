import { RelatedReadContainer, RelatedReadItem } from '@site/src/components';

The Temporal Web UI provides users with Workflow Execution state and metadata for debugging purposes.
It ships with every [Temporal CLI](/cli) release and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) update and is available with [Temporal Cloud](/cloud).

You can configure the Temporal Web UI to work in your own environment.
See the [UI configuration reference](/references/web-ui-configuration).

Web UI open source repos:

- [temporalio/ui](https://github.com/temporalio/ui)
- [temporalio/ui-server](https://github.com/temporalio/ui-server)

## Namespaces

All Namespaces in your self-hosted Temporal Service or Temporal Cloud account are listed under **Namespaces** in the left section of the window.
You can also switch Namespaces from the Workflows view by selecting from the Namespace switcher at the top right corner of the window.
After you select a Namespace, the Web UI shows the Recent Workflows page for that Namespace.
In Temporal Cloud, users can access only the Namespaces that they have been granted access to.
For details, see [Namespace-level permissions](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions).

## Recent Workflows

The main Workflows page displays a table of recent Workflow Executions.
The Web UI displays a maximum of 1,000 Workflow Executions.

Users can list Workflow Executions by any of the following:

- Status
- [Workflow ID](/workflow-execution/workflowid-runid#workflow-id)
- [Workflow Type](/workflow-definition#workflow-type)
- Start time
- End time
- A [List Filter](/list-filter)

For start time and end time, users can set their preferred date and time format as one of the following:

- UTC
- Local
- Relative

Select a Workflow Execution to view the Workflow Execution's History, Workers, and pending Activities.

### Saved Views

Saved Views let you save and reuse your frequently used visibility queries in the Temporal Web UI. 
Instead of recreating complex filters every time, you can save them once and apply them with a single click.

Saved Views are stored locally in your browser and are available to you whenever you use the Temporal Web UI in this browser. 
Each user will have their own private collection.

#### Apply a Saved View

By default, The Workflows page has several default Saved Views. You can also create your own Saved Views.

Click the name of a Saved View in the list to display the corresponding Workflows that match the query.

The Workflow List page will refresh with the results of the Saved View.

#### Create a Saved View

You can create a new Saved View from the Workflows page.

1. Create a Saved View by using the filter UI to build your criteria, or you can use the raw query editor to write custom query strings. 
1. Your new view will appear in the Custom Views list as New View. Click the Save as New button to bring up the Save as View window. Name your Saved View. Names must be unique to each user and can contain a max of 255 characters.
1. Click Save. Your new view will appear in the Custom Views list

You can create up to 20 Saved Views. When you reach this limit, you'll need to delete some Saved Views before you can save new ones.

#### Make Temporary Changes to a Saved View query

You can modify a Saved View temporarily without changing the saved criteria.

1. Select the Saved View you want to change.
1. Adjust the UI filters as needed.
1. The Workflows page will refresh with the results of the new query, without changing the Saved View.
1. If you want to keep your temporary changes, you can:
    - Click Save, which will replace the original Saved View with your modifications.
    - Click Edit, modify the name, and click Save, which will replace the original Saved View with your modifications and change the name.
    - Click Edit, modify the name, and click Create New, which will create a new Saved View with your new settings and a new name.

#### Rename a Saved View Query

You can rename an existing Saved View from the Workflows page.

1. Select the Saved View you want to change.
1. Click Edit.
1. In the Edit View dialog box, enter a new name for the Saved View.
1. Click Save to apply your changes and rename the existing Saved View, or click Create Copy to create a new Saved View with the new name.

#### Deleting Saved Views

You can delete a Saved View from the Workflows page, because it is no longer useful, or to create room for new Saved Views.

1. Select the Saved View you want to delete. You can only delete queries you’ve created; you cannot delete the system defaults.
1. Click “Edit” and then "Delete this Saved View". 

:::note Deleting Saved Views is permanent

Deleted queries cannot be recovered, so make sure you won't need them again. 
If you accidentally delete a Saved List, you will need to recreate it.

:::

#### Share a Saved View

You can share a Saved View as a URL.

1. Select the Saved View you want to share.
1. Click the “Share” button to copy the URL for this Saved View to the clipboard. You can also copy the URL directly from the browser. 

:::note Saved Views and time

Saved Views that use relative times will be shared with absolute time.

## History

A Workflow Execution History is a view of the [Events](/workflow-execution/event#event) and Event fields within the Workflow Execution.
Approximately [40 different Events](/references/events) can appear in a Workflow Execution's Event History.

The top of the page lists the following execution metadata:

- [Workflow Type](/workflow-definition#workflow-type)
- [Run Id](/workflow-execution/workflowid-runid#run-id)
- Start Time and Close Time
- [Task Queue](/task-queue)
- Parent and Parent ID
- [State Transitions](/workflow-execution#state-transition)

The Input and Results section displays the function arguments and return values for debugging purposes.
Results are not available until the Workflow finishes.

The Recent Events tab has the following views:

- Timeline: A chronological or reverse-chronological order of events with a summary.
  Clicking into an Event displays all details for that Event.
  Clicking “Expand all” displays all Event details.
  Similarly, clicking “Collapse all” collapses the table and displays only the summary.
- Compact: A logical grouping of Activities, Signals and Timers.
- JSON: The full JSON code for the workflow.

#### Download Event History

The entire Workflow Execution Event History, in JSON format, can be downloaded from this section.

#### Terminate Workflow

Workflow Executions can be Terminated directly from the UI.
A custom note can be logged from the UI when that happens.

#### Workers

Displays the Workers currently polling on the Workflow Task Queue with a count.
If no Workers are polling, an error displays.

#### Pending Activities

Displays a summary of recently active and/or pending Activity Executions.
Clicking a pending Activity directs the user to the Pending Activities tab to view details.

#### Call Stack

The screen shows the captured result from the [\_\_stack_trace](/sending-messages#stack-trace-query) Query.
The Query is performed when the tab is selected.
It works only if a Worker is running and available to return the call stack. The call stack shows each location where Workflow code is waiting.

#### Queries

Lists all Queries sent to the Workflow Execution.

## Schedules

On Temporal Cloud and self-hosted Temporal Service Web UI, the Schedules page lists all the [Schedules](/schedule) created on the selected Namespace.

Click a Schedule to see details, such as configured frequency, start and end times, and recent and upcoming runs.

:::tip Setting Schedules with Strings

Temporal Workflow Schedule Cron strings follow this format:

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### Settings

On Temporal Cloud, **Settings** is visible only to Account Owner and Global Admin [roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles).

Click **Settings** to see and manage the list of users in your account and to set up integrations such as [Observability](/cloud/metrics) and [Audit logging](/cloud/audit-logging).

On a self-hosted Temporal Service, manage your users, metrics, and logging in your [server configuration](/references/configuration).

### Archive

On a self-hosted Temporal Service, Archive shows [Archived](/temporal-service/archival) data of your Workflow Executions on the Namespace.

To see data in your self-hosted Temporal Service, you must have [Archival set up and configured](/self-hosted-guide/archival).

For information and details on the Archive feature in Temporal Cloud, contact your Temporal representative.

### Codec Server

The Web UI can use a [Codec Server](/codec-server) with a custom Data Converter to decode inputs and return values.
For details, see [Securing your data](/production-deployment/data-encryption).

The UI supports a [Codec Server endpoint](/production-deployment/data-encryption#web-ui).
For details on setting the Codec Server endpoint, see [Codec Server setup](/production-deployment/data-encryption#codec-server-setup).

### Labs mode

The Web UI provides a "labs" mode for users to try out upcoming, production-ready UI features and improvements.
When off, users will experience the current UI.
Features will move in and out of labs mode according to demand and feedback.
Labs mode can be turned on or off at any time in the left navigation bar via the Labs icon.
