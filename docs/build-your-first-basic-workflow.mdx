# Build your First Basic Workflow

Learn Temporal's core concepts by building a money transfer application that demonstrates reliability, failure handling, and live debugging capabilities.

## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, you'll discover why Temporal is a "cure-all" for building reliable applications by:

- ✅ **Running your first Temporal Workflow** with real failure scenarios
- ✅ **Understanding core concepts** like Workflows, Activities, and Workers  
- ✅ **Exploring the Temporal Web UI** for application state visibility
- ✅ **Experiencing live debugging** - fix bugs in running applications without losing state
- ✅ **Seeing automatic retries** handle transient failures gracefully

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial:

- **Local development environment** set up for Temporal (choose your language below)
- **Git installed** to clone the example project
- **Basic programming knowledge** in your chosen language

## The Money Transfer Application

You'll build a **money transfer application** that simulates real-world financial transactions with these critical operations:

1. **Withdraw** money from source account
2. **Deposit** money to target account  
3. **Refund** money if deposit fails

### Why This Matters

In traditional applications, handling failures in this flow is complex:
- What if withdrawal succeeds but deposit fails?
- How do you retry operations safely?
- How do you maintain transaction state during server crashes?

**Temporal solves all of these problems automatically.** 🎯

## Key Concepts You'll Experience

### Workflows
Define the overall business logic flow. In our case: withdraw → deposit → (refund if needed).

### Activities  
Individual operations that can fail and be retried (calling external services, database operations, etc.).

### Workers
Temporal processes that execute your Workflows and Activities reliably.

### Retry Policies
Automatic retry configuration that handles transient failures without custom code.

## What Makes This Tutorial Special

Unlike typical "Hello World" examples, this tutorial shows:

1. **Real failure scenarios** - See how Temporal handles actual problems
2. **Live debugging** - Fix bugs in running applications without restarting
3. **State persistence** - Applications survive server crashes and resume exactly where they left off
4. **Automatic retries** - Temporal handles retry logic so you don't have to

## Choose Your Language to Get Started

## What You'll Experience Step-by-Step

### Part 1: **Build Your First Workflow** (~10 minutes)
- **Download and explore** the money transfer project  
- **Run your first Workflow** and see a successful transaction
- **Explore the Web UI** to inspect Workflow state and execution history
- **Understand core concepts** like Workflows, Activities, and Workers

### Part 2: **Test Reliability Features** (~10 minutes)
- **Simulate server crashes** and see workflows survive infrastructure failures
- **Introduce Activity failures** and watch automatic retry mechanisms
- **Live debug a running Workflow** - fix bugs without losing state
- **Experience Temporal's reliability superpowers** firsthand

## Key Advantages You'll Discover

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how Temporal provides:

### 🔍 **Full Visibility**
See exactly what your application is doing at every step with detailed execution history.

### 🛡️ **Guaranteed Execution**  
Your Workflows run to completion even through server crashes, network failures, and code deployments.

### ⚙️ **Declarative Retries**
Configure retry policies in your code instead of implementing complex retry logic.

### 🔧 **Live Debugging**
Debug and fix issues in production applications while they're running.

### 🏗️ **Focus on Business Logic**
Write application code without worrying about infrastructure concerns like state management and failure recovery.
