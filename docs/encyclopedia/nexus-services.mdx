:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is now [Generally Available](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#general-availability) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

:::

[Nexus Services](/glossary#nexus-service) are named collections of [Nexus Operations](/nexus/operations) that provide a contract for sharing across team boundaries.
A [Nexus Endpoint](/nexus/endpoints) exposes Services for callers to use.

Services are registered in a Worker that polls the Endpoint's target Task Queue.
Multiple Services can run in the same Worker.
Services typically run alongside the Workflows they abstract, or in a dedicated router Worker using the [router-queue pattern](/nexus/patterns#router-queue-pattern).

Callers reference a Service by name when executing a Nexus Operation.
