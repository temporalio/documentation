:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

:::

Nexus Operations can return an error for a caller Workflow to handle.
If an asynchronous Nexus Operation starts a Workflow that returns an error, it will be propagated back to the caller Workflow.

## Errors in Nexus handlers

In Temporal, a user-defined Nexus handler is primarily responsible for starting a Nexus Operation.
Nexus handlers run in a Temporal Worker and use Temporal SDK builder functions like New-Sync-Operation or New-Workflow-Run-Operation to start an Operation.
Nexus handlers may return [different error types](/references/failures#nexus-errors).
Nexus Operations can end up in [completed](/references/events#nexusoperationcompleted), [failed](/references/events#nexusoperationfailed), [canceled](/references/events#nexusoperationcanceled), and [timed out](/references/events#nexusoperationtimedout) states.

The Nexus Machinery breaks up the [Nexus Operation lifecycle](/nexus/operations#operation-lifecycle) into one or more [Nexus Tasks](/workers#nexus-task) that a Nexus handler is responsible for processing.
It creates a Nexus Task to start an Operation and may create additional Nexus Tasks, for example to cancel a long-running [asynchronous Operation](/nexus/operations#asynchronous-operation-lifecycle).

By default, Nexus handler errors are considered retryable, unless specified below:

- [Application Failures](/references/failures#nexus-errors) marked as non-retryable.
- [Unsuccessful Operation errors](/references/failures#nexus-errors) that can resolve an operation as either failed or canceled.
- [Non-retryable Nexus errors](/references/failures#non-retryable-nexus-errors).

For example, if an unknown error is returned from a Nexus handler it will be classified as a retryable error.

When an error is received by the caller's Nexus Machinery:

- If a [non-retryable error](/references/failures#non-retryable-nexus-errors) is returned, the caller Workflow will have a [NexusOperationFailed](/references/events#nexusoperationfailed) event added to its Workflow History.
- If a [retryable error](/references/failures#retryable-nexus-errors) is returned, the Nexus Machinery will automatically retry the [Nexus Task](/workers#nexus-task), as discussed in [automatic retries](/nexus/operations#automatic-retries).
  These errors are visible to the caller Workflow as part of integrated execution debugging in [Pending Operations](/nexus/execution-debugging/#pending-operations).

:::tip

To avoid infinite [automatic retries](/nexus/operations#automatic-retries) and improve semantics, custom Nexus handlers should return a [specific Nexus error type](/references/failures#nexus-errors).

See [errors in Nexus Operations](/references/failures#errors-in-nexus-operations) for additional details.

## Nexus error handling in caller Workflows

A Nexus Operation Failure is delivered to the Workflow Execution when a Nexus Operation fails.
It contains information about the failure and the Nexus Operation Execution; for example, the Nexus Operation name and Nexus Operation ID.
The reason for the failure is in the message and in the underlying cause is typically an Application Error or a Canceled Error.
