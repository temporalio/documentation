:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is now [Generally Available](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#general-availability) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

:::

Nexus Operations can return errors for a caller Workflow to handle.
Errors from an asynchronous Operation's underlying Workflow propagate back to the caller.

## Errors in Nexus handlers

Nexus handlers may return [different error types](/references/failures#nexus-errors).
By default, handler errors are retryable unless they are:

- [Application Failures](/references/failures#nexus-errors) marked as non-retryable.
- [Unsuccessful Operation errors](/references/failures#nexus-errors) that resolve an Operation as failed or canceled.
- [Non-retryable Nexus errors](/references/failures#non-retryable-nexus-errors).

When the caller's Nexus Machinery receives an error:

- **Non-retryable** - A [NexusOperationFailed](/references/events#nexusoperationfailed) event is added to the caller's Workflow History.
- **Retryable** - The Nexus Machinery [automatically retries](/nexus/operations#automatic-retries). These errors surface in [Pending Operations](/nexus/execution-debugging/#pending-operations).

:::tip

Return a [specific Nexus error type](/references/failures#nexus-errors) to avoid infinite retries.
See [errors in Nexus Operations](/references/failures#errors-in-nexus-operations) for additional details.

## Nexus error handling in caller Workflows

When a Nexus Operation fails, the caller receives a Nexus Operation Failure containing the Operation name, token, and failure reason.
The underlying cause is typically an Application Error or Canceled Error.
