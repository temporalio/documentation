A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a [Workflow Execution](/workflow-execution) or an [Activity Task Execution](/tasks#activity-task-execution).
Note that Retry Policies do not apply to [Workflow Task Executions](/tasks#workflow-task-execution), which retry until the Workflow Execution Timeout (which is unlimited by default) with an exponential backoff and a max interval of 10 minutes.

Try out the [Activity retry simulator](/develop/activity-retry-simulator) to visiualize how a Retry Policy works.

## Default behavior

- **Workflow Execution:** When a Workflow Execution is spawned, it is not associated with a default Retry Policy and thus does not retry by default.
  The intention is that a Workflow Definition should be written to never fail due to intermittent issues; an Activity is designed to handle such issues.

- **Activity Execution:** When an Activity Execution is spawned, it is associated with a default Retry Policy, and thus Activity Task Executions are retried by default.
  When an Activity Task Execution is retried, the Temporal Service places a new [Activity Task](/tasks#activity-task) into its respective [Activity Task Queue](/task-queue), which results in a new Activity Task Execution.

## Custom Retry Policy

To use a custom Retry Policy, provide it as an options parameter when starting a Workflow Execution or Activity Execution.
Only certain scenarios merit starting a Workflow Execution with a custom Retry Policy, such as the following:

- A [Temporal Cron Job](/cron-job) or some other stateless, always-running Workflow Execution that can benefit from retries.
- A file-processing or media-encoding Workflow Execution that downloads files to a host.

## Properties

### Default values for Retry Policy

```
Initial Interval     = 1 second
Backoff Coefficient  = 2.0
Maximum Interval     = 100 × Initial Interval
Maximum Attempts     = ∞
Non-Retryable Errors = []
```

### Initial Interval

- **Description:** Amount of time that must elapse before the first retry occurs.
  - **The default value is 1 second.**
- **Use case:** This is used as the base interval time for the [Backoff Coefficient](#backoff-coefficient) to multiply against.

### Backoff Coefficient

- **Description:** The value dictates how much the _retry interval_ increases.
  - **The default value is 2.0.**
  - A backoff coefficient of 1.0 means that the retry interval always equals the [Initial Interval](#initial-interval).
- **Use case:** Use this attribute to increase the interval between retries.
  By having a backoff coefficient greater than 1.0, the first few retries happen relatively quickly to overcome intermittent failures, but subsequent retries happen farther and farther apart to account for longer outages.
  Use the [Maximum Interval](#maximum-interval) attribute to prevent the coefficient from increasing the retry interval too much.

### Maximum Interval

- **Description:** Specifies the maximum interval between retries.
  - **The default value is 100 times the [Initial Interval](#initial-interval).**
- **Use case:** This attribute is useful for [Backoff Coefficients](#backoff-coefficient) that are greater than 1.0 because it prevents the retry interval from growing infinitely.

### Maximum Attempts

- **Description:** Specifies the maximum number of execution attempts that can be made in the presence of failures.
  - **The default is unlimited.**
  - If this limit is exceeded, the execution fails without retrying again. When this happens an error is returned.
  - Setting the value to 0 also means unlimited.
  - Setting the value to 1 means a single execution attempt and no retries.
  - Setting the value to a negative integer results in an error when the execution is invoked.
- **Use case:** Use this attribute to ensure that retries do not continue indefinitely.
  In most cases, we recommend using the Workflow Execution Timeout for [Workflows](/workflows) or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout for Activities to limit the total duration of retries, rather than using this attribute.

### Non-Retryable Errors {#non-retryable-errors}

- **Description:** Specifies errors that shouldn't be retried.
  - **Default is none.**
  - Errors are matched against the `type` field of the [Application Failure](/references/failures#application-failure).
  - If one of those errors occurs, a retry does not occur.
- **Use case:** If you know of errors that should not trigger a retry, you can specify that, if they occur, the execution is not retried.

#### Non-Retryable Errors for Activities

When writing software applications, you will encounter three types of failures: transient, intermittent, and permanent.
While transient and intermittent failures may resolve themselves upon retrying without further intervention, permanent failures will not.
Permanent failures, by definition, require you to make some change to your logic or your input.
Therefore, it is better to surface them than to retry them.

Non-Retryable Errors are errors that will not be retried, regardless of a Retry Policy.

To raise a non-retryable error, specify the `non_retryable` flag when raising an `ApplicationError`:

```ruby
raise Temporalio::Error::ApplicationError.new(
  "Invalid credit card number: #{credit_card_number}",
  type: 'InvalidChargeAmount',
  non_retryable: true
)
```

This will designate the `ApplicationError` as non-retryable.

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

To raise a non-retryable error, specify the `non_retryable` flag when raising an `ApplicationError`:

```python
    raise ApplicationError(
        f"Invalid credit card number: {credit_card_number}",
        type="InvalidChargeAmount",
        non_retryable=True,
    )
```

This will designate the `ApplicationError` as non-retryable.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

To throw a non-retryable error, add `nonRetryable: true` to `ApplicationFailure.create({})`:

```typescript
throw ApplicationFailure.create({
    message: `Invalid charge amount: ${chargeAmount} (must be above zero)`,
    details: [chargeAmount],
    nonRetryable: true
});
```

This will designate the Error as non-retryable.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

To throw a non-retryable error, use the `newNonRetryableFailure` method:

```java
    throw ApplicationFailure.newNonRetryableFailure(
      "Invalid credit card number: " + creditCardNumber,
      InvalidChargeAmountException.class.getName());
```

This will designate the `ApplicationFailure` as non-retryable.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Go">

To return a non-retryable error, replace your call to `NewApplicationError()` with `NewNonRetryableApplicationError()`:

```go
temporal.NewNonRetryableApplicationError("Credit Card Charge Error", "CreditCardError", nil, nil)
```

This will designate the Error as non-retryable.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dotnet" label=".NET">

To throw a non-retryable error, specify the `nonRetryable` flag when throwing an `ApplicationFailureException`:

```csharp
var attempt = ActivityExecutionContext.Current.Info.Attempt;

throw new ApplicationFailureException(
    $"Something bad happened on attempt {attempt}",
    errorType: "my_failure_type",
    nonRetryable: true);
```

This will designate the `ApplicationFailureException` as non-retryable.

Use non-retryable errors in your code sparingly.

If you do not specify the failure as non-retryable within the definition, you can always mark that error type as non-retryable in your Activity's Retry Policy, but an `ApplicationError` with the `non_retryable` keyword argument set to `true` will always be non-retryable.

</Tabs>

For example, checking for bad input data is a reasonable time to use a non-retryable error.
If the Activity cannot proceed with the input it has, that error should be surfaced immediately so that the input can be corrected on the next attempt.

If responsibility for your application is distributed across multiple maintainers, or if you are developing a library to integrate into somebody else's application, you can think of the decision to hardcode non-retryable errors as following a "caller vs. implementer" dichotomy.
Anyone who is calling your Activity would be able to make decisions about their Retry Policy, but only the implementer can decide whether an error should never be retryable out of the box.

## Retry interval

The wait time before a retry is the _retry interval_. A retry interval is the smaller of two values:

- The [Initial Interval](#initial-interval) multiplied by the [Backoff Coefficient](#backoff-coefficient) raised to the power of the number of retries.
- The [Maximum Interval](#maximum-interval).

### Per-error next Retry delay

Sometimes, your Activity or Workflow raises a special exception that needs a different retry interval from the Retry Policy.
To accomplish this, you may throw an [Application Failure](/references/failures#application-failure) with the next Retry delay field set. This value will replace and override whatever the retry interval would be on the Retry Policy.
Note that your retries will still cap out under the Retry Policy's Maximum Attempts, as well as overall timeouts. For an Activity, its Schedule-to-Close Timeout applies. For a Workflow, the Execution Timeout applies.

## Event History

There are some subtle nuances to how Events are recorded to an Event History when a Retry Policy comes into play.

- For an Activity Execution, the [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events#activitytaskstarted) Event will not show up in the Workflow Execution Event History until the Activity Execution has completed or failed (having exhausted all retries).
  This is to avoid filling the Event History with noise.
  Use the Describe API to get a pending Activity Execution's attempt count.

- For a Workflow Execution with a Retry Policy, if the Workflow Execution fails, the Workflow Execution will [Continue-As-New](/workflow-execution/continue-as-new) and the associated Event is written to the Event History.
  The [WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew](/references/events#workflowexecutioncontinuedasnew) Event will have an "initiator" field that will specify the Retry Policy as the value and the new Run Id for the next retry attempt.
  The new Workflow Execution is created immediately.
  But the first Workflow Task won't be scheduled until the backoff duration is exhausted.
  That duration is recorded as the `firstWorkflowTaskBackoff` field of the new run's `WorkflowExecutionStartedEventAttributes` event.
