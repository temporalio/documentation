## What are Worker Deployments? {#deployments}

A Worker Deployment is a logical service that groups similar Workers together for unified management.
Each Deployment has a name (such as your service name) and supports versioning through a series of [Worker Deployment Versions](#deployment-versions).

## What are Worker Deployment Versions? {#deployment-versions}

A Worker Deployment Version represents an iteration of a Worker Deployment.
Each Deployment Version consists of Workers that share the same code build and environment.
When a Worker starts polling for Workflow and Activity Tasks, it reports its Deployment Version to the Temporal Server.

## What can I do with Worker Deployments? {#use-cases}

Worker Deployments currently support [Worker Versioning](/worker-versioning), with more features planned for the future.

## How do I enable Worker Deployments? {#how-to}

:::note

Temporal Server disables Worker Deployments by default.

Temporal Cloud customers: Contact your Temporal account team or the [Temporal Support Team](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/support#support-ticket) for Pre-release access.

Open source users: Enable the [system.enableDeploymentVersions](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/common/dynamicconfig/constants.go) and [frontend.workerVersioningWorkflowAPIs](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/common/dynamicconfig/constants.go) dynamic config values by setting both to `true`.

For example, with the Temporal CLI, run:

```command
temporal server start-dev \
   --dynamic-config-value system.enableDeploymentVersions=true \
   --dynamic-config-value frontend.workerVersioningWorkflowAPIs=true
```

:::

To add your Worker to a Deployment, provide both the Deployment name and Version when creating your Worker.
When your deployment system is ready, turn on Versioning as well. Refer to [Worker Versioning](/worker-versioning) for details.

When running multiple Workers in one process (such as using multiple [Task Queues](/task-queue)), you'll typically use the same Deployment name for all of them, since they belong to the same service.

The server will automatically register new Deployments and Deployment Versions when a Worker connects. You can see the status of Versions on the Deployments page in [Temporal UI](https://docs.temporal.io/web-ui).

SDK-specific documentation will be available soon.
