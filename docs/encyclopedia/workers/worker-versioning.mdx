This page defines some of the underlying concepts used in [Worker Versioning](/production-deployment/worker-deployments/worker-versioning):

- [Versioning Behaviors](#versioning-behaviors)
- [Versioning Statuses](#versioning-statuses)
- [Continue-as-new, Child Workflow, and Retry Semantics](#inheritance-semantics)

### Versioning Behaviors {#versioning-behaviors}

Using **Workflow Pinning**, you can declare each Workflow type to have a **Versioning Behavior**, either Pinned or Auto-Upgrade.

#### Pinned Workflows {#pinned}

A **Pinned** Workflow is guaranteed to complete on a single Worker Deployment Version. You can mark a Workflow Type as pinned when you register it by adding an additional Pinned parameter. If you need to move a pinned Workflow to a new version, use [`temporal workflow update-options`](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/workflow#update-options).

#### Auto-Upgrade Workflows {#auto-upgrade}

An **Auto-Upgrade** Workflow will move to the latest Worker Deployment Version automatically whenever you change the current version. Auto-upgrade Workflows are not restricted to a single Deployment Version and need to be kept replay-safe manually, i.e. with [patching](/workflow-definition#workflow-versioning).

### Versioning Statuses {#versioning-statuses}

A Worker Deployment Version moves through the following states:

1. **Inactive**: The version exists because a Worker with that version has polled the server. If this version never becomes Active, it will never be Draining or Drained.
2. **Active**: The version is either Current or Ramping, so it is accepting new Workflows and existing auto-upgrade Workflows.
3. **Draining**: The version has open pinned Workflows running on it, but stopped being Current or Ramping, usually because a newer version has been deployed. It is possible to be Draining and have no open pinned Workflows for a short time, since the drainage status is updated only periodically.
4. **Drained**: The version was draining and now all the pinned Workflows that were running on it are closed. Closed Workflows may still re-run some code paths if they are [Queried](https://docs.temporal.io/sending-messages#sending-queries) within their [Retention Period](https://docs.temporal.io/temporal-service/temporal-server#retention-period) and Workers with that version are still polling.

### Continue-as-new, Child Workflow, and Retry Semantics {#inheritance-semantics}

When Workflows start new runs (e.g. by continuing-as-new or retrying) the new run may inherit their versioning behavior. This section explains how inheritance works across different Workflow execution patterns.

#### Ways Workflows Start New Runs

A Workflow can start a new run through:

- Starting a [Child Workflow](https://docs.temporal.io/child-workflows)
- Invoking [Continue-As-New](https://docs.temporal.io/workflow-execution/continue-as-new)
- Retrying per its [Retry Policy](https://docs.temporal.io/encyclopedia/retry-policies)
- Starting another iteration of a [Cron Job](https://docs.temporal.io/cron-job) (superseded by [Schedules](https://docs.temporal.io/schedule))

#### Inheritance Rules Overview

Auto-upgrade Workflows never inherit versions.
By default, Pinned workflows will pass their version to any Pinned children.

This section provides more detail on specific inheritance scenarios.

#### Inheritance by Scenario

##### Child Workflows

**When Parent is Pinned:**

- Child inherits the parent's version if the child's Task Queue belongs to that version
- Child's first Workflow task executes in the same version as its parent
- If child is also Pinned: child remains Pinned to the inherited version for its lifetime
- If child is Auto-Upgrade: child's behavior changes to Auto-Upgrade after the first task completes
- If child's Task Queue is not in the same Worker Deployment as parent: no inheritance occurs, child starts on Current Version of its task queue

**When Parent is Auto-upgrade:**

- Child inherits no initial Versioning Behavior
- Child starts on the Current Version of its Worker Deployment like all new Workflow executions

##### Continue-As-New

**When Original Workflow is Pinned:**

- The Pinned version is inherited across the Continue-As-New chain
- If the new run's Task Queue is not in the same Worker Deployment as the original Workflow: no inheritance occurs, new run starts on Current Version of its task queue

**When Original Workflow is Auto-upgrade:**

- No version inheritance occurs

##### Retries

**Inheritance Conditions (all must be met):**

- The retried run is effectively pinned at the time of retry
- The retried run inherited a pinned version when it started (i.e., it is a child of a pinned parent, or a Continue-As-New of a pinned run)
- The retried run is running on a Task Queue in the inherited version

**When Conditions Not Met:**

- No version inheritance occurs

##### Cron Jobs

- **Never inherit** versioning behavior or version

#### Versioning Override vs. Non-Override Inheritance

##### Versioning Override Inheritance

- Children, crons, retries, and continue-as-new inherit the source run's override **if**:
  - The override is pinned, **AND**
  - The new Workflow's Task Queue belongs to the override version
- Override inheritance is evaluated separately and takes precedence over inherited base version
