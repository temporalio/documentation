This page defines some of the underlying concepts used in [Worker Versioning](/production-deployment/worker-deployments/worker-versioning):

- [Worker Deployments](#deployments)
- [Worker Deployment Versions](#deployment-versions)
- [Versioning Behaviors](#versioning-behaviors)
- [Versioning Definitions](#versioning-definitions)
- [Versioning Statuses](#versioning-statuses)
- [Continue-as-new, Child Workflow, and Retry Semantics](#inheritance-semantics)

## Worker Deployments {#deployments}

A Worker Deployment is a logical service that groups similar Workers together for unified management.
Each Deployment has a name (such as your service name) and supports versioning through a series of Worker Deployment Versions.

## Worker Deployment Versions {#deployment-versions}

A Worker Deployment Version represents an iteration of a Worker Deployment.
Each Deployment Version consists of Workers that share the same code build and environment.
When a Worker starts polling for Workflow and Activity Tasks, it reports its Deployment Version to the Temporal Server.

## Versioning Behaviors {#versioning-behaviors}

Using **Workflow Pinning**, you can declare each Workflow type to have a **Versioning Behavior**, either Pinned or Auto-Upgrade.

To learn more about implementing Worker Versioning, see our [Worker Versioning in production](production-deployment/worker-deployments/worker-versioning) page.

### Pinned Workflows {#pinned}

A **Pinned** Workflow is guaranteed to complete on a single Worker Deployment Version. You can mark a Workflow Type as pinned when you register it by adding an additional Pinned parameter. If you need to move a pinned Workflow to a new version, use [`temporal workflow update-options`](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/workflow#update-options).

### Auto-Upgrade Workflows {#auto-upgrade}

An **Auto-Upgrade** Workflow will move to the latest Worker Deployment Version automatically whenever you change the current version. Auto-upgrade Workflows are not restricted to a single Deployment Version and need to be kept replay-safe manually, i.e. with [patching](/workflow-definition#workflow-versioning).

## Versioning Definitions

- **Current Worker Deployment Version**: The version where Workflows are routed to unless they were previously pinned on a different version. Other versions can continue polling to allow pinned Workflows to finish executing or in case you need to roll back. If no current version is specified, the default is unversioned.
- **Ramping Worker Deployment Version**: The version where a configurable percentage of Workflows are routed to unless they were previously pinned on a different version. The ramp percentage can be in the range [0, 100]. Workflows that don't go to the Ramping Version will go to the Current Version. If no Ramping Version is specified, 100% of new Workflows and Auto-Upgrade Workflows will go to the Current Version.
- **Target Worker Deployment Version**: The version your Workflow will move to next. This could be the Deployment's Current Version or the Ramping Version. For example, if an Auto-Upgrade Workflow was running on Version A, the Current Version is B, and there is a 5% ramp to C, there is a 95% chance that its Target Version is B and 5% that it's C.

## Versioning Statuses {#versioning-statuses}

A Worker Deployment Version moves through the following states:

1. **Inactive**: The version exists because a Worker with that version has polled the server. If this version never becomes Active, it will never be Draining or Drained.
2. **Active**: The version is either Current or Ramping, so it is accepting new Workflows and existing auto-upgrade Workflows.
3. **Draining**: The version has open pinned Workflows running on it, but stopped being Current or Ramping, usually because a newer version has been deployed. It is possible to be Draining and have no open pinned Workflows for a short time, since the drainage status is updated only periodically.
4. **Drained**: The version was draining and now all the pinned Workflows that were running on it are closed. Closed Workflows may still re-run some code paths if they are [Queried](https://docs.temporal.io/sending-messages#sending-queries) within their [Retention Period](https://docs.temporal.io/temporal-service/temporal-server#retention-period) and Workers with that version are still polling.

## Continue-as-new, Child Workflow, and Retry Semantics {#inheritance-semantics}

When Workflows start new runs (e.g. by continuing-as-new or retrying) the new run may inherit their versioning behavior. This section explains how inheritance works across different Workflow execution patterns.

### Ways Workflows Start New Runs

A Workflow can start a new run through:

- Starting a [Child Workflow](https://docs.temporal.io/child-workflows)
- Invoking [Continue-As-New](https://docs.temporal.io/workflow-execution/continue-as-new)
- Retrying per its [Retry Policy](https://docs.temporal.io/encyclopedia/retry-policies)
- Starting another iteration of a [Cron Job](https://docs.temporal.io/cron-job) (superseded by [Schedules](https://docs.temporal.io/schedule))

### Inheritance Rules Overview

Auto-upgrade Workflows never inherit versions.
By default, Pinned workflows will pass their version to any Pinned children.

This section provides more detail on specific inheritance scenarios.

### Inheritance by Scenario

#### Child Workflows

**When Parent is Pinned:**

- Child inherits the parent's version if the child's Task Queue belongs to that version
- Child's first Workflow task executes in the same version as its parent
- If child is also Pinned: child remains Pinned to the inherited version for its lifetime
- If child is Auto-Upgrade: child's behavior changes to Auto-Upgrade after the first task completes
- If child's Task Queue is not in the same Worker Deployment as parent: no inheritance occurs, child starts on Current Version of its task queue

**When Parent is Auto-upgrade:**

- Child inherits no initial Versioning Behavior
- Child starts on the Current Version of its Worker Deployment like all new Workflow executions

#### Continue-As-New

**When Original Workflow is Pinned:**

- The Pinned version is inherited across the Continue-As-New chain
- If the new run's Task Queue is not in the same Worker Deployment as the original Workflow: no inheritance occurs, new run starts on Current Version of its task queue

**When Original Workflow is Auto-upgrade:**

- No version inheritance occurs

#### Retries

**Inheritance Conditions (all must be met):**

- The retried run is effectively pinned at the time of retry
- The retried run inherited a pinned version when it started (i.e., it is a child of a pinned parent, or a Continue-As-New of a pinned run)
- The retried run is running on a Task Queue in the inherited version

**When Conditions Not Met:**

- No version inheritance occurs

#### Cron Jobs

- **Never inherit** versioning behavior or version

### Versioning Override Inheritance

- Children, crons, retries, and continue-as-new inherit the source run's override **if**:
  - The override is pinned, **AND**
  - The new Workflow's Task Queue belongs to the override version
- Override inheritance is evaluated separately and takes precedence over inherited base version
