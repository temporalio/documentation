# Worker Shutdown Behavior

When a Worker shuts down, it stops polling for new tasks and begins the shutdown sequence.
In the case of in-flight workflow tasks (WFTs), shutdown may cause them to fail if they aren’t completed in time, after exhausting retry policy attempts.

There are two types of shutdown behavior that can occur, depending on whether an idea of “graceful shutdown” is configured.

## Graceful Shutdown

Graceful shutdown configures how much time a Worker has to complete its current task before shutting down. An activity is able to determine that the Worker it’s running on is being shut down, through the activity context.

> Core SDKs - `graceful_shutdown_period`

> Go - `WorkerStopTimeout`

> Java - `shutdown()` followed by `awaitTermination(timeout, unit)`

### Workflow tasks

Any in-flight workflow tasks are (attempted to be) completed. The only reason they may not immediately, is if workflow code is (incorrectly) blocking, or because of local activities (see below).

### Activities

Activities are allowed to complete during the graceful shutdown period.

### Local Activities

Because Local Activities run within a WFT, current and future Local Activities within the same WFT will be allowed to run and complete, assuming there is no additional command to yield to.

If the Local Activity is unable to complete by the graceful shutdown period, the Local Activity attempt is sent a cancel signal, no new Local Activities will be retried or started, and the Worker is shut down.
The Worker still waits for the current WFT to complete, meaning you can eventually hit your workflow task or execution timeout, unless another Worker is spun up.

## Non-Graceful Period Shutdown

This behavior is for either no graceful period being specified, or if shutdown has taken longer than the configured graceful period. In all cases, the activity context is canceled and the Worker will finish shutdown when the current WFT completes (with either success or failure).

:::note
Go and Core SDKs behave differently when we pass task timeout and the Activity or Local Activity is still running:

**Go** - shutdown completes, but the Activity will continue to run and use a slot

**Core** - Worker shutdown will not complete while the Activity completes
:::

### Local Activities

The Local Activity is sent a cancel signal, WFT heartbeats stop, and no new Local Activities will be retried or started.
The Worker still waits for the current WFT to complete, meaning you can eventually hit your workflow task or execution timeout, unless another Worker is spun up.

## General Developer Guidance

- Ensure activities and local activities **honor context cancellation** or other shutdown signals.
- Expect that **long/hung local activities may block shutdown** unless you fail early. Local Activities
  should already generally be used for extremely short activities, so this is the user's burden.
