## What is a Task Queue? {#task-queue}

A Task Queue is a lightweight, dynamically allocated queue that one or more [Worker Entities](#worker-entity) poll for [Tasks](#task).

There are two types of Task Queues, Activity Task Queues and Workflow Task Queues.

    />
  </div>
</div>

Task Queues are very lightweight components.
Task Queues do not require explicit registration but instead are created on demand when a Workflow Execution or Activity spawns or when a Worker Process subscribes to it.
When a Task Queue is created, both a Workflow Task Queue and an Activity Task Queue are created under the same name.
There is no limit to the number of Task Queues a Temporal Application can use or a Temporal Service can maintain.

Workers poll for Tasks in Task Queues via synchronous RPC.
This implementation offers several benefits:

- A Worker Process polls for a message only when it has spare capacity, avoiding overloading itself.
- In effect, Task Queues enable load balancing across many Worker Processes.
- Task Queues enable what we call [Task Routing](#task-routing), which is the routing of specific Tasks to specific Worker Processes or even a specific process.
- Task Queues support server-side throttling, which enables you to limit the Task dispatching rate to the pool of Worker Processes while still supporting Task dispatching at higher rates when spikes happen.
- When all Worker Processes are down, messages simply persist in a Task Queue, waiting for the Worker Processes to recover.
- Worker Processes do not need to advertise themselves through DNS or any other network discovery mechanism.
- Worker Processes do not need to have any open ports, which is more secure.

All Workers listening to a given Task Queue must have identical registrations of Activities and/or Workflows.
The one exception is during a Server upgrade, where it is okay to have registration temporarily misaligned while the binary rolls out.

#### Where to set Task Queues

There are four places where the name of the Task Queue can be set by the developer.

1. A Task Queue must be set when spawning a Workflow Execution:

- [How to start a Workflow Execution using the Go SDK](/develop/go/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)
- [How to start a Workflow Execution using the Java SDK](/develop/java/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)
- [How to start a Workflow Execution using the PHP SDK](/develop/php/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)
- [How to start a Workflow Execution using the Python SDK](/develop/python/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)
- [How to start a Workflow Execution using the TypeScript SDK](/develop/typescript/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)
- [How to start a Workflow Execution using the .NET SDK](/develop/dotnet/temporal-client#start-workflow)

::: 

2. A Task Queue name must be set when creating a Worker Entity and when running a Worker Process:

:::info

- [How to run a development Worker using the Java SDK](/develop/java/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)
- [How to run a development Worker using the PHP SDK](/develop/php/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)
- [How to run a development Worker using the Python SDK](/develop/python/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)
- [How to run a development Worker using the TypeScript SDK](/develop/typescript/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)
- [How to run a development Worker using the .NET SDK](/develop/dotnet/core-application#run-worker-process)

- [How to run a Temporal Cloud Worker using the Go SDK](/develop/go/core-application#run-a-temporal-cloud-worker)
- [How to run a Temporal Cloud Worker using the TypeScript SDK](/develop/typescript/core-application#run-a-temporal-cloud-worker)

::: 

Note that all Worker Entities listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker Entity polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it will fail that Task.
However, the failure of the Task will not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

3. A Task Queue name can be provided when spawning an Activity Execution:

This is optional.
An Activity Execution inherits the Task Queue name from its Workflow Execution if one is not provided.

- [How to start an Activity Execution using the .NET SDK](/develop/dotnet/core-application#activity-execution)

4. A Task Queue name can be provided when spawning a Child Workflow Execution:

This is optional.
A Child Workflow Execution inherits the Task Queue name from its Parent Workflow Execution if one is not provided.

#### Task ordering

Task Queues can be scaled by adding partitions.
The [default](/references/dynamic-configuration#service-level-rps-limits) number of partitions is 4.

Task Queues with multiple partitions do not have any ordering guarantees.
Once there is a backlog of Tasks that have been written to disk, Tasks that can be dispatched immediately (“sync matches”) are delivered before tasks from the backlog (“async matches”).
This approach optimizes throughput.

Task Queues with a single partition are almost always first-in, first-out, with rare edge case exceptions.
However, using a single partition limits you to low- and medium-throughput use cases.

:::note

This section is on the ordering of individual Tasks, and does not apply to the ordering of Workflow Executions, Activity Executions, or [Events](/workflows#event) in a single Workflow Execution.
The order of Events in a Workflow Execution is guaranteed to remain constant once they have been written to that Workflow Execution's [History](/workflows#event-history).
