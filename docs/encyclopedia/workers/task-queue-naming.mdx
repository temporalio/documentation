# Task Queue Names

The Temporal Service maintains a set of Task Queues, which Workers poll to see
what work needs to be done. Each Task Queue is identified by a name, which is
provided to the Temporal Service when launching a Workflow Execution.

Since Task Queues are created dynamically when they are first used, a mismatch
between these two values does not result in an error. Instead, it will result
in the creation of two different Task Queues. Consequently, the Worker will
not receive any tasks from the Temporal Service and the Workflow Execution
will not progress. Therefore, we recommend that you define the Task Queue name
in a constant that is referenced by the Client and Worker if possible, as this
will ensure that they always use the same value.

However, itâ€™s not always possible to do define the Task Queue name in a constant, such as when the Client used
to start the Workflow is running on another system or is implemented in a
different programming language.
