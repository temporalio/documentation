:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

:::

Nexus supports end-to-end execution debugging that may span:

- Caller Workflows
- One or more Nexus Operations executed within and across Namespaces
- Underlying Temporal primitives, like a Workflow, created by a Nexus Operation handler

This includes [multi-level Nexus calls](/nexus#multi-level-calls), for example:

- Workflow A → Nexus Operation 1 → Workflow B → Nexus Operation 2 → Workflow C

## Bi-directional linking

Bi-directional links enable navigation of an end-to-end execution across Namespace boundaries in the Temporal UI.
They are automatically added by the Temporal SDK for builder functions like New-Workflow-Run-Operation.
Links are auto-wired from a specific Nexus Operation event in the caller's Workflow history to a specific event in the handler's Workflow history.

![Bi-directional linking](/img/nexus/nexus-bi-directional-linking.png)

Bi-directional links enable navigating across Namespace boundaries:

- Forward through the Nexus Operation execution:
  - From a Nexus Operation event in the caller's Workflow history.
  - To the underlying event in the handler's Workflow.
- Backwards through the Nexus Operation execution:
  - From the underlying event in the handler's Workflow.
  - To a Nexus Operation event in the caller's Workflow history.

## Pending Operations

Similar to pending Activities, pending Nexus Operations are displayed in the Workflow details page and using: `temporal workflow describe`.

For example, from the Temporal UI:\
![Pending Operations](/img/nexus/pending-nexus-operations.png)

For example, from the `temporal` CLI:

```
temporal workflow describe

Pending Nexus Operations: 1

  Endpoint                 myendpoint
  Service                  my-hello-service
  Operation                echo
  OperationID
  State                    BackingOff
  Attempt                  6
  ScheduleToCloseTimeout   0s
  NextAttemptScheduleTime  20 seconds from now
  LastAttemptCompleteTime  11 seconds ago
  LastAttemptFailure       {"message":"handler error (INTERNAL): internal error","applicationFailureInfo":{}}
```

Retryable Nexus errors [returned from a Nexus handler](/nexus/error-handling#errors-in-nexus-handlers) will surface as part of the Pending Operation in a caller Workflow.
Non-retryable errors will result in the Nexus Operation reaching a final state in the caller Workflow, with a [Failed](/references/events#nexusoperationfailed), [TimedOut](/references/events#nexusoperationtimedout) or [Canceled](/references/events#nexusoperationcanceled) event.

## Pending Callbacks

Nexus callbacks are sent from the handler's Namespace to the caller's Namespace to complete an asynchronous Nexus Operation.
These show up in the UI and using: `temporal workflow describe`.

For example, from the Temporal UI:\
![Pending Callbacks](/img/nexus/nexus-callback.png)

For example, from the `temporal` CLI:

```
temporal workflow describe


Callbacks: 1

  URL               https://nexus.phil-caller-Namespace.a2dd6.cluster.tmprl.cloud:7243/Namespaces/phil-caller-Namespace.a2dd6/nexus/callback
  Trigger           WorkflowClosed
  State             Succeeded
  Attempt           1
  RegistrationTime  32 minutes ago
```

## Nexus Operation ID

Nexus Operations created with the Temporal SDK New-Workflow-Run-Operation helper, return the Workflow ID as the Nexus Operation ID.
The caller's Workflow history shows the Nexus Operation ID in the [NexusOperationStarted](/references/events#nexusoperationstarted) event.

![Workflow history](/img/nexus/nexus-operations-ui.png)

This can be used to search the handler's Namespace for that Workflow ID:

![Search handler's Namespace](/img/nexus/nexus-operations-ui-search-handler.png)

This may also be done using: `temporal workflow show --detailed`
