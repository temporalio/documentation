:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is now [Generally Available](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#general-availability) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

:::

Nexus supports end-to-end execution debugging that may span:

- Caller Workflows
- One or more Nexus Operations executed within and across Namespaces
- Underlying Temporal primitives, like a Workflow, created by a Nexus Operation handler

This includes [multi-level Nexus calls](/nexus#multi-level-calls), for example:

- Workflow A → Nexus Operation 1 → Workflow B → Nexus Operation 2 → Workflow C

## Bi-directional linking

Bi-directional links enable navigation of an end-to-end execution across Namespace boundaries in the Temporal UI.
They are automatically added by the Temporal SDK for builder functions like New-Workflow-Run-Operation.
Links are auto-wired from a specific Nexus Operation event in the caller's Workflow history to a specific event in the handler's Workflow history.

Bi-directional links enable navigating across Namespace boundaries:

- Forward through the Nexus Operation execution:
  - From a Nexus Operation event in the caller's Workflow history.
  - To the underlying event in the handler's Workflow.
- Backwards through the Nexus Operation execution:
  - From the underlying event in the handler's Workflow.
  - To a Nexus Operation event in the caller's Workflow history.

## Pending Operations

Similar to pending Activities, pending Nexus Operations are displayed in the Workflow details page and using: `temporal workflow describe`.

For example, from the Temporal UI:

<CaptionedImage
    src="/img/cloud/nexus/pending-nexus-operations.png"
    title="Pending Operations"
    zoom="true"
/>

For example, from the `temporal` CLI:

```
temporal workflow describe

Pending Nexus Operations: 1

  Endpoint                 myendpoint
  Service                  my-hello-service
  Operation                echo
  OperationToken
  State                    BackingOff
  Attempt                  6
  ScheduleToCloseTimeout   0s
  NextAttemptScheduleTime  20 seconds from now
  LastAttemptCompleteTime  11 seconds ago
  LastAttemptFailure       {"message":"handler error (INTERNAL): internal error","applicationFailureInfo":{}}
```

Retryable Nexus errors [returned from a Nexus handler](/nexus/error-handling#errors-in-nexus-handlers) will surface as part of the Pending Operation in a caller Workflow.
Non-retryable errors will result in the Nexus Operation reaching a final state in the caller Workflow, with a [Failed](/references/events#nexusoperationfailed), [TimedOut](/references/events#nexusoperationtimedout) or [Canceled](/references/events#nexusoperationcanceled) event.

## Pending Callbacks

Nexus callbacks are sent from the handler's Namespace to the caller's Namespace to complete an asynchronous Nexus Operation.
These show up in the UI and using: `temporal workflow describe`.

For example, from the Temporal UI:

<CaptionedImage
    src="/img/cloud/nexus/nexus-callback.png"
    title="Pending Callbacks"
    zoom="true"
/>

For example, from the `temporal` CLI:

```
temporal workflow describe

Callbacks: 1

  URL               https://nexus.phil-caller-Namespace.a2dd6.cluster.tmprl.cloud:7243/Namespaces/phil-caller-Namespace.a2dd6/nexus/callback
  Trigger           WorkflowClosed
  State             Succeeded
  Attempt           1
  RegistrationTime  32 minutes ago
```

## Tracing

Temporal integrates with tracing libraries like [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/).
Tracing allows you to visualize the call graph of a Workflow, including its Activities, Nexus Operations, and Child Workflows.
You can enable tracing by installing an interceptor on the Temporal Client or Worker in the supported SDKs.
See the samples linked below to enable tracing for the SDKs:

- [Go SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/opentelemetry)
- [Java SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/main/core/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/tracing)
