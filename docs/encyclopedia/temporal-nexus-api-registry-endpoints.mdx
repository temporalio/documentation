### Nexus API Registry {#nexus-api-registry}

The Nexus API Registry is an account-scoped list of Nexus `Endpoints` available within an account.
Endpoints descriptions are rendered as markdown, and can include Service and Operation descriptions, and input/output types, so consumers know how to use the Services and Endpoint offers.

### Nexus Endpoints {#nexus-endpoints}

A Nexus `Endpoint` is like an API proxy that can serve one or more Nexus `Services` from a target Namespace and target Task Queue that a `Worker` is listening on.
This enables presenting a clean API contract and hiding the underlying Temporal implementation, which may consist of internal `Workflows`, `Signals`, and other Temporal primitives.

Adding a Nexus `Endpoint` to the API Registry allows Nexus Operation requests to be sent to the underlying target Namespace and Task Queue, using the name of the Endpoint in the API Registry.
Temporal Cloud also provides built-in Endpoint access control in the form of a caller Namespace allowlist, which must be set for any caller to access a Nexus Endpoint, even if in the same Namespace.

Multiple Nexus `Endpoints` can target the same target `Namespace`. For example you can add multiple Nexus Endpoints to a large monolithic Namespace as facades, refactor consumers to use the facade, and then refactor behind the facade by migrating the Endpoints (and underlying Temporal primitives) to separate Namespaces.
This can provide improved team autonomy, blast radius isolation, and security â€“ and a cleaner separation of concerns.
