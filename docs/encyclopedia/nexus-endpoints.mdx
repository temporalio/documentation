:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

:::

A [Nexus Endpoint](/glossary#nexus-endpoint) is a reverse proxy that can route Nexus requests from a caller Workflow to an upstream target Namespace and Task Queue.
A [Nexus Service](/nexus/services) runs in a Worker that is polling the Endpoint's target Task Queue.

An Endpoint decouples the caller and handler, so the caller only needs to know the Endpoint name.
The Endpoint encapsulates the upstream target Namespace and Task Queue from the caller.
A Worker handles Nexus requests by registering one or more [Nexus Services](/nexus/services) and polling the Endpoint's target Task Queue.

![Nexus Overview](/img/nexus-overview-short.png)

Multiple Nexus Endpoints can target the same target Namespace.

Adding a Nexus Endpoint to the [Nexus Registry](/nexus/registry) deploys the Endpoint, so it is available at runtime to serve Nexus requests.
