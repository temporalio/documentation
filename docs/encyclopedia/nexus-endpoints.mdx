:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is now [Generally Available](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#general-availability) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

:::

A [Nexus Endpoint](/glossary#nexus-endpoint) is a fully managed reverse proxy for [Nexus Services](/nexus/services).
It routes requests from a caller Workflow to a target Namespace and Task Queue.
Callers only need to know the Endpoint name - the target Namespace, Task Queue, and internal implementation are encapsulated.

Workers handle Nexus requests by registering one or more Services and polling the Endpoint's target Task Queue.
Multiple Endpoints can target different Task Queues in the same Namespace.

The Endpoint description field supports markdown for documenting available Operations, contact information, or schema links.

## Reverse proxy for Nexus Services, not a general purpose L7 proxy

A Nexus Endpoint is not a general-purpose L7 proxy. It routes Nexus requests to a single upstream target.
The [EndpointSpec](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/2a5b3951e71565e28628edea1b3d88d69ed26607/temporal/api/nexus/v1/message.proto#L170) supports two [target types](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/2a5b3951e71565e28628edea1b3d88d69ed26607/temporal/api/nexus/v1/message.proto#L185):

- **Worker**: Route to a target Namespace and Task Queue.
- **External** (experimental): Route to an external [Nexus RPC endpoint](https://github.com/nexus-rpc/api/blob/main/SPEC.md) using `--target-url` in `temporal operator nexus create endpoint` (self-hosted only).

## Deploying a Nexus Endpoint

Adding an Endpoint to the [Nexus Registry](/nexus/registry) deploys it immediately. The Endpoint is available at runtime as soon as it's registered.
