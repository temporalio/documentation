:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

:::

## Arbitrary-duration operations

[Nexus Operations](/glossary#nexus-operation) are arbitrary-duration operations that may be synchronous or asynchronous, short-lived or long-lived, and are used to connect Temporal Applications within and across Namespaces, clusters, regions, and clouds.

Unlike a traditional RPC, an asynchronous Nexus Operation has an operation identity that can be used to re-attach to a long-lived Nexus Operation, for example, one backed by a Temporal Workflow.
Nexus Operations support a uniform interface to get the status of an operation or its result, receive a completion callback, or cancel the operation – all of which are fully integrated into the Temporal Platform.

## SDK support

The Temporal SDK provides an integrated Temporal experience to build, run, and use Nexus Operations.

:::tip RESOURCES
- [Go SDK - Nexus quick start and code sample](/develop/go/nexus)
- [Java SDK - Nexus quick start and code sample](/develop/java/nexus)
:::

Caller Workflows use the Temporal SDK to execute Nexus Operations.

Nexus Operation handlers are created with Temporal SDK builder functions such as:

- New-Workflow-Run-Operation
  - Start a Workflow as an asynchronous Operation.
- New-Sync-Operation
  - Invoke an underlying Query or Signal as a synchronous Operation.
  - Invoke an Update as a synchronous Operation.
  - Execute arbitrary code as a synchronous Operation.

## Nexus Operation lifecycle {#operation-lifecycle}

When you execute a Nexus Operation from a caller Workflow using the Temporal SDK, a command is sent to Temporal to schedule the Nexus Operation which is atomically handed off to the Nexus Machinery.
The [Nexus Machinery](/glossary#nexus-machinery) uses state-machine-based invocation and completion callbacks to ensure [at-least-once](#at-least-once-execution-semantics-and-idempotency) execution of a Nexus Operation and reliable delivery of the result.

![Nexus Overview](/img/nexus-overview.png)

The Nexus Machinery is responsible for making the Nexus RPC calls on behalf of the caller Workflow, with [automatic-retries](#automatic-retries).
This means you don't have to use Nexus RPC directly, only the Temporal SDK along with the Temporal Service.

### Synchronous Operation lifecycle

Nexus supports synchronous Operations that take less than 10 seconds to execute, as measured from the caller's Nexus Machinery.

![Nexus Sync Operation Lifecycle](/img/nexus/nexus-sync-operation.png)

The lifecycle for a synchronous Nexus Operation, for example to Signal or Query a Workflow:

1. Caller Workflow executes a Nexus Operation using the Temporal SDK.
1. Caller Worker issues a [ScheduleNexusOperation](/references/commands#schedulenexusoperation) command to it's Namespace gRPC endpoint.
1. Caller Namespace records a [NexusOperationScheduled](/references/events#nexusoperationscheduled) event in the caller's Workflow History.
1. Caller Nexus Machinery makes a Nexus call to start a Nexus Operation.
1. Handler Nexus Machinery recieves the Nexus request and sync matches to a handler Worker.
1. Handler Worker gets a [Nexus Task](/workers#nexus-task) to start a Nexus Operation, by polling the Nexus Endpoint's target Task Queue.
1. Handler processes the Nexus Task, using the Temporal SDK **New-Sync-Operation**.
1. Handler responds to it's Namespace gRPC endpoint with the Operation result.
1. Caller Namespace records the result in the caller's Workflow history as a Nexus event, for example [Completed](/references/events#nexusoperationcompleted) or [Failed](/references/events#nexusoperationfailed).
1. Caller Worker polls for a Workflow Task on it's Workflow Task Queue.
1. Caller Workflow gets the Operation result, using the Temporal SDK.

:::tip

Stay within the remaining request deadline budget to avoid being timed out.
If a Nexus handler times out, the Operation will be retried by the caller's Nexus Machinery until the Operation's Schedule-to-Close timeout has been exceeded.

### Asynchronous Operation lifecycle {#asynchronous-operation-lifecycle}

An asynchronous Nexus Operation may take up to 60 days to complete in Temporal Cloud, which is the maximum Schedule-to-Close-Timeout.

![Nexus Async Operation Lifecycle](/img/nexus/nexus-async-operation.png)

The lifecycle of an asynchronous Nexus Operation, with differences between the synchronous lifecycle in bold:

1. Caller Workflow executes a Nexus Operation using the Temporal SDK.
1. Caller Worker issues a [ScheduleNexusOperation](/references/commands#schedulenexusoperation) command to its Namespace gRPC endpoint.
1. Caller Namespace records a [NexusOperationScheduled](/references/events#nexusoperationscheduled) event in the caller Workflow's History.
1. Caller Nexus Machinery makes a Nexus RPC to start a Nexus Operation.
1. Handler Nexus Machinery recieves the Nexus request and sync matches to a handler Worker.
1. Handler Worker gets a [Nexus Task](/workers#nexus-task) to start a Nexus Operation, by polling the Nexus Endpoint's target Task Queue.
1. Handler processes the Nexus Task, using the Temporal SDK **New-Workflow-Run-Operation**.
1. Handler responds to it's Namespace gRPC endpoint with the **start Operation response**.
1. Caller Namespace records the response in the caller's Workflow history as a Nexus event, for example **[NexusOperationStarted](/references/events#nexusoperationstarted)**.
1. **Handler Workflow completes and the [Nexus Completion Callback](/glossary#nexus-async-completion-callback) is delivered to the caller's Nexus Machinery.**
1. Caller Namespace records the result in the caller's Workflow history as a Nexus event, for example [Completed](/references/events#nexusoperationcompleted) or [Failed](/references/events#nexusoperationfailed).
1. Caller Worker polls for a Workflow Task on its Workflow Task Queue.
1. Caller Workflow gets the Operation result, using the Temporal SDK.

### Executing arbitrary code from a synchronous Nexus Operation handler {#executing-arbitrary-code-from-a-sync-handler}

Synchronous Nexus Operation handlers can execute arbitrary code, but unlike Activities they should be short-lived.
As mentioned above, a synchronous Nexus Operation handler has less than 10 seconds to process a Nexus start Operation request and should stay within the remaining request deadline budget for the Nexus request. 
For example, this may be done by looking at the Request-Timeout header or hooking into cancelation that is triggered when the timeout is exceeded.

![Nexus Operations with Arbitrary Code](/img/nexus/nexus-sync-operation-arbitrary-code.png)

### System interactions

Temporal Nexus Operations are requested and processed using the Temporal queue-based Worker architecture.
Workers interact with thier Namespace gRPC endpoint as before.
Nexus Machinery on both sides handles the cross-namepace communication.

![Nexus Queue-based Worker Architecture](/img/nexus/nexus-workers.png)

For example, when you execute a Nexus Operation in a caller Workflow the following Namespace gRPC calls are made:
1. **RespondWorkflowTaskCompleted([ScheduleNexusOperation command](/references/commands#schedulenexusoperation))** \-
is used by the caller Worker to schedule a Nexus Operation, which atomically hands off execution to the caller's Nexus Machinery.
1. **PollNexusTaskQueue** \-
is used by the handler Worker to recieve a [Nexus Task](/workers#nexus-task) to process, for example to start a Nexus Operation.
1. **RespondNexusTaskCompleted** or **RespondNexusTaskFailed** \-
is used by the handler Worker to return the Nexus Task result.
When asked to start a Nexus Operation, the Nexus handler decides if the Operation will be synchronous or asynchronous.
   1. This is typically a static decision based on the [Temporal SDK builder function used](#sdk-support).
   1. [Asynchronous Nexus Operations](#asynchronous-operation-lifecycle), created with the New-Workflow-Run-Operation SDK helper, will return a Nexus Operation ID, that can be used to perform additional actions like canceling an Operation.
   1. [Synchronous Nexus Operations](#synchronous-operation-lifecycle), created with the New-Sync-Operation SDK helper, will return the Operation result directly.
   1. The caller's Nexus Machinery recieves the result and records a NexusOperation event in the caller's Workflow History.
1. **PollWorkflowTaskQueue** \-
is used by the caller Worker to recieve a Workflow Task with the Nexus Operation event which may be 
[Started](/references/events#nexusoperationstarted),
[Completed](/references/events#nexusoperationcompleted),
[Failed](/references/events#nexusoperationfailed),
[Canceled](/references/events#nexusoperationcanceled), or
[TimedOut](/references/events#nexusoperationtimedout).


## Automatic Retries {#automatic-retries}

Once the caller Workflow schedules an Operation with the caller's Temporal Service, the caller's Nexus Machinery keeps trying to start the Operation.
If a [retryable Nexus error](/references/failures#nexus-errors) is returned the Nexus Machinery will retry until the Nexus Operation's Start-to-Close-Timeout is exceeded.

For example, if a Nexus handler returns a [retryable error](/references/failures#nexus-errors), or an [upstream timeout](https://github.com/nexus-rpc/api/blob/main/SPEC.md#predefined-handler-errors) is encountered by the caller, the Nexus request will be retried up to the [default Retry Policy's](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/de7c8879e103be666a7b067cc1b247f0ac63c25c/components/nexusoperations/config.go#L111) max attempts and expiration interval.

:::note
This differs from how Activities and Workflows handle errors and retries:

- [Errors in Activities](/references/failures#errors-in-activities)
- [Non-retryable errors](/references/failures#non-retryable)

:::

See [errors in Nexus handlers](/nexus/error-handling#errors-in-nexus-handlers) to control the retry behavior by returning a [non-retryable Nexus error](/references/failures#non-retryable-nexus-errors).

## Execution semantics {#execution-semantics}

### At-least-once execution semantics and idempotency

The Nexus Machinery provides reliable execution with at-least-once execution semantics for a Nexus Operation, until the caller's Schedule-to-Close-Timeout is exceeded, at which time the overall Nexus Operation times out.

The Nexus Machinery breaks up the [Nexus Operation lifecycle](/nexus/operations#operation-lifecycle) into one or more [Nexus Tasks](/workers#nexus-task) that a Nexus handler is responsible for processing.
If a Nexus handler times out or returns a non-retryable Nexus error, then the Nexus Machinery will retry the Nexus request to provide at-least-once execution.
This means it's possible for your Nexus handler to be invoked multiple times for a given Nexus Operation.

To deal with at-least-once execution, the Nexus Operation handler should be idempotent, like Activities should be idempotent.
It's not required in all cases, but highly recommended in general.

### Exactly-once execution semantics through an underlying WorkflowIDReusePolicy

To deduplicate work and get exactly-once execution semantics, a Nexus Operation can start a Workflow with a WorkflowIDReusePolicy of RejectDuplicates which only allows one Workflow Execution per Workflow ID within a Namespace for the Retention Period.

## Cancelation

The request to cancel a caller Workflow is automatically propagaged to all pending Nexus Operations, and in turn any underlying handler Workflows.

If an underlying handler Workflow is canceled, the Nexus Operation will report a [Canceled Failure](/references/failures#cancelled-failure) to the caller's Workflow Execution.

## Termination

If the caller Workflow is Terminated, all pending Nexus Operations are abandoned. If possible, consider [cancelation](#cancelation) instead.

## Versioning {#versioning}

Task Routing is the simplest way to version your service code.

If you have a new backward-incompatible Nexus Operation Handler, for example due to a wire-level incompatible breaking change, start by using a different Service and Task Queue.
The version may be part of the service name, for example `prod.payments.v2`.
Callers can then migrate to the new version in their normal deployment schedule.
