The Temporal Workflow guide covers: 
- [Workflow Definitions](/workflow-definition) (including Deterministic constraints, Versioning Code, and Workflow Type)
- [Workflow Execution](/workflow-execution) (including Replay, Command, Limits, Events, and Workflow ID)
- [Schedules](/schedule)
- [Dynamic Handler](/dynamic-handler)
- [Cron Job](/cron-job)

This page provides a basic overview of Introduction to Workflow. 

## Intro to Workflows
Conceptually, a workflow defines a sequence of steps.
With Temporal, those steps are defined by writing code, known as a Workflow Definition, and are carried out by running that code, which results in a Workflow Execution.

In day-to-day conversations, the term Workflow might refer to Workflow Type, a Workflow Definition, or a Workflow Execution. 

1. A **Workflow Definition** is the code that defines your Workflow.
2. The **Workflow Type** is the name associated with that Workflow Definition. 
It's an identifier that makes it possible to distinguish one type of Workflow (such as order processing) from another (such as customer onboarding).
3. A **Workflow Execution** is a running Workflow, which is created by combining a Workflow Definition with a request to execute it. 
You can execute a Workflow Definition any number of times, potentially providing different input each time (i.e., a Workflow Definition for order processing might process order #123 in one execution and order #567 in another execution). 
It is the  actual instance of the Workflow Definition running in the Temporal Platform.


You'll develop those Workflows by writing code in a general-purpose programming language such as Go, Java, TypeScript, or Python. 
The code you write is the same code that will be executed at runtime, so you can use your favorite tools and libraries to develop Temporal Workflows.

Temporal Workflows are resilient. 
They can run—and keeping running—for years, even if the underlying infrastructure fails. 
If the application itself crashes, Temporal will automatically recreate its pre-failure state so it can continue right where it left off.


Each Workflow Execution progresses through a series of **Commands** and **Events**, which are recorded in an **Event History**. 
It can be paused, resumed, continued as new, or reset.

Workflows can:

- Spawn Activities and Child Workflows
- Receive Signals and respond to Queries
- Use Timers, Start Delay, and Side Effects
- Be scheduled with Cron Jobs or Schedules

Workflows must follow deterministic constraints to ensure consistent replay behavior.

## Workflow Definition
A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the Workflow. 
It is written in a supported programming language and SDK.

Below are different ways to develop a basic Workflow Definition.

## Workflow Execution

While the Workflow Definition is the code that defines the Workflow, the Workflow Execution is created by executing that code.
When you run a Workflow Definition, you create a Workflow Execution. 
Each execution is an independent instance with its own state and context. 
This means you can run the same Workflow Definition for different orders, customers, or scenarios, with each execution maintaining its own unique progress.
A Workflow Execution is identified by a Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace.

Each Workflow Execution:

- Has exclusive access to its local state.
- Executes concurrently with other Workflow Executions.
- Communicates with the outside world through Activities and Signals.

A Workflow Execution may run for seconds or years and resume progress after Worker or service outages. 
If needed, it can Continue-As-New to start fresh with a new Event History.

## Workflow Type 
A Workflow Type in Temporal is a name that maps to a Workflow Definition.  
It allows you to distinguish and serves as an identifier between different Workflow implementations and provides a way to track and manage specific workflow patterns.
A Workflow Type is used to create a Workflow Execution. 
Each time you start a workflow using the same Workflow Type, you create a new Workflow Execution with a unique Run ID.

Temporal Workflows are engineered to handle complex, distributed processes with remarkable resilience. 
They can survive infrastructure failures, automatically recreate pre-failure states, maintain comprehensive Event Histories, and support advanced workflow management techniques including pausing, resuming, and resetting entire process instances.
