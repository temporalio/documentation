This page provides a basic overview of Introduction to Workflow. 

## Intro to Workflows

Temporal applications are built using an abstraction called Workflows. 
You'll develop those Workflows by writing code in a general-purpose programming language such as Go, Java, TypeScript, or Python. 
The code you write is the same code that will be executed at runtime, so you can use your favorite tools and libraries to develop Temporal Workflows.

Temporal Workflows are resilient. 
They can run—and keeping running—for years, even if the underlying infrastructure fails. 
If the application itself crashes, Temporal will automatically recreate its pre-failure state so it can continue right where it left off.


A Temporal Workflow defines the overall flow of your application. 
Conceptually, it is a sequence of steps written in a general-purpose programming language using a Temporal SDK.

A Workflow consists of:

- A **Workflow Definition**: the code that defines the steps.
- A **Workflow Execution**: the actual instance of the Workflow Definition running in the Temporal Platform.
- A **Workflow Type**: a name that maps to a Workflow Definition and is used when starting an Execution.

Conceptually, a workflow defines a sequence of steps.
With Temporal, those steps are defined by writing code, known as a Workflow Definition, and are carried out by running that code, which results in a Workflow Execution.


1. A Workflow Definition is the code. It's what defines your Workflow.
2. The Workflow Type is the name associated with that Workflow Definition. 
It's an identifier that makes it possible to distinguish one type of Workflow (such as order processing) from another (such as customer onboarding).
3. A Workflow Execution is a running Workflow, which is created by combining a Workflow Definition with a request to execute it. 
You can execute a Workflow Definition any number of times, potentially providing different input each time (i.e., a Workflow Definition for order processing might process order #123 in one execution and order #567 in another execution). 


Workflows are:
- Durable: Can run for seconds or years.
- Reliable: Recoverable after failure.
- Scalable: Can be executed concurrently by millions of instances.

Each Workflow Execution progresses through a series of **Commands** and **Events**, which are recorded in an **Event History**. 
It can be paused, resumed, continued as new, or reset.

Workflows can:

- Spawn Activities and Child Workflows
- Receive Signals and respond to Queries
- Use Timers, Start Delay, and Side Effects
- Be scheduled with Cron Jobs or Schedules

Workflows must follow deterministic constraints to ensure consistent replay behavior.


## Workflow Definition
A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the Workflow. 
It is written in a supported programming language and SDK.

Below are different ways to develop a basic Workflow Definition.

## Workflow Execution

While the Workflow Definition is the code that defines the Workflow, the Workflow Execution is created by executing that code.

A Workflow Execution is:
-  Durable, reliable, and scalable function execution.
- The main unit of execution in a Temporal Application.
- Identified by a Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace.

Each Workflow Execution:

- Has exclusive access to its local state.
- Executes concurrently with other Workflow Executions.
- Communicates with the outside world through Activities and Signals.

A Workflow Execution may run for seconds or years and resume progress after Worker or service outages. 
If needed, it can Continue-As-New to start fresh with a new Event History.

## Workflow Type 
A Workflow Type in Temporal is a name that maps to a Workflow Definition. 
It serves as an identifier for a specific workflow implementation.
A Workflow Type is used to create a Workflow Execution.
It can be instantiated as multiple Workflow Executions and is scoped by a Task Queue. 
It is acceptable to have the same Workflow Type name map to different Workflow Definitions if they are using completely different Workers.

The relationship between them works like this: 
- You write code (Workflow Definition)
- That code is identified by a name (Workflow Type)
- When you want to run that code, you create a Workflow Execution by referencing the Workflow Type

Each time you start a workflow using the same Workflow Type, you create a new Workflow Execution with a unique Run ID.
