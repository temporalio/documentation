## What is Patching? {#patching}

Patching essentially defines a logical branch for a specific change in the Workflow.
It can be used to revise in-progress Workflows.
If your Workflow is not [pinned to a specific Worker Deployment Version](/production-deployment/worker-deployments/worker-versioning) or you need to fix a bug in a running workflow, you can patch it.

### Detailed Description of the `patched()` Function

This applies to the `patched()` function in the Python, .NET, and Ruby SDKs.

#### Behavior When Not Replaying

If the execution is not replaying, when it encounters a call to `patched()`, it first checks the event history.

- If the patch ID is not in the event history, the execution adds a marker to the event history, upserts a search attribute, and returns `true`. This happens in the first block of the patch ID.
- If the patch ID is in the event history, the execution doesn't modify the history, and returns `true`.
  This happens in a patch ID's subsequent blocks, because the event history was updated in the first block.

There is a caveat to this behavior, which we will cover below.

#### Behavior When Replaying With Marker Before-Or-At Current Location

If the execution is replaying and has a call to `patched()`, and if the event history has a marker from a call to `patched()` in the same place (which means it will match the original event history), then it writes a marker to the replay event history and returns `true`.

This is similar to the behavior of the non-replay case, and also happens in a given patch ID's first block.

If the code has a call to `patched()`, and the event history has a marker with that Patch ID earlier in the history, it will return `true` and will not modify the replay event history.

This is also similar to the behavior of the non-replay case, and also happens in a given patch ID's subsequent blocks.

#### Behavior When Replaying With Marker After Current Location

If the Event History's Marker Event is after the current execution point, that means the new patch is too early.
The execution will encounter the new patch before the original.
The execution will attempt to write the marker to the replay event history, but it will throw a non-deterministic exception because the replay and original event histories don't match.

#### Behavior When Replaying With No Marker For that Patch ID

During a Replay, if there is no marker for a given patch ID, the execution will return `false` and will not add a marker to the event history. In addition, all future calls to `patched()` with that ID will return `false` -- even after it is done replaying and is running new code.

The [preceding section](#behavior-when-not-replaying) states that if the execution is not replaying, the `patched()` function will always return `true`.
If the marker doesn't exist, it will be added, and if the marker already exists, it won't be re-added.

However, this behavior doesn't occur if there was already a call to `patched()` with that ID in the replay code, but not in the event history.
In this situation, the function won't return `true`.

#### A Summary of the Two Potentially Unexpected Behaviors

Recapping the potentially unexpected behaviors that may occur during a Replay:

If the execution hits a call to `patched()`, but that patch ID isn't _at or before that point_ in the event history, you may not realize that the event history _after_ the current execution location matters.
This behavior occurs because:

- If that patch ID exists later, you get a non-determinism error
- If the patch doesn't exist later, you don't get a non-determinism error, and the call returns `false`

If the execution hits a call to `patched()` with an ID that doesn't exist in the history, then not only will it return `false` in that occurence, but it will also return `false` if the execution surpasses the Replay threshold and is running new code.

#### Implications of the Behaviors

If you deploy new code while Workflows are executing, any Workflows that were in the middle of executing will Replay up to the point they were at when the Worker was shut down.
When they do this Replay, they will not follow the `patched()` branches in the code.
For the rest of the execution after they have replayed to the point before the deployment and worker restart, they will either:

- Use new code if there was no call to `patched()` in the replay code
- If there was a call to `patched()` in the replay code, they will
  run the non-patched code during and after replay

This might sound odd, but it's actually exactly what's needed because that means that if the future patched code depends on earlier patched code, then it won't use the new code -- it will use the old code instead.

But if there's new code in the future, and there was no code earlier in the body that required the new patch, then it can switch over to the new code, which it will do.

Note that this behavior means that the Workflow _does not always run the newest code_.
It only does that if not replaying or if replay is surpassed and there hasn't been a call to `patched()` (with that ID) throughout the replay.

#### Recommendations

Based on this behavior and the implications, when patching in new code, always put the newest code at the top of an if-patched-block.

```python
if patched('v3'):
    # This is the newest version of the code.
    # put this at the top, so when it is running
    # a fresh execution and not replaying,
    # this patched statement will return true
    # and it will run the new code.
    pass
elif patched('v2'):
    pass
else:
    pass
```

The following sample shows how `patched()` will behave in a conditional block that's arranged differently.
In this case, the code's conditional block doesn't have the newest code at the top.
Because `patched()` will return `True` when not Replaying (except with the preceding caveats), this snippet will run the `v2` branch instead of `v3` in new executions.

```python
if patched('v2'):
    # This is bad because when doing a new execution (i.e. not replaying),
    # patched statements evaluate to True (and put a marker
    # in the event history), which means that new executions
    # will use v2, and miss v3 below
    pass
elif patched('v3'):
    pass
else:
  pass
```
