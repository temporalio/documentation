### What is a Timer? {#timer}

Temporal SDKs offer Timer APIs so that Workflow Executions are deterministic in their handling of time values.

Timers in Temporal are persisted, meaning that even if your Worker or Temporal Service is down when the time period completes, as soon as your Worker and Temporal Service become available, the call that is awaiting the Timer in your Workflow code will resolve, causing execution to proceed.
Timers are reliable and efficient.
Workers consume no additional resources while waiting for a Timer to fire, so a single Worker can await millions of Timers concurrently.

- [How to set Timers in Java](/develop/java/timers)
- [How to set Timers in PHP](/develop/php/timers)
- [How to set Timers in Python](/develop/python/timers)
- [How to set Timers in TypeScript](/develop/typescript/timers)
- [How to set Timers in .NET](/develop/dotnet/durable-timers)

The duration of a Timer is fixed, and your Workflow might specify a value as short as one second or as long as several years.
Although it's possible to specify an extremely precise duration, such as 36 milliseconds or 15.072 minutes, your Workflows should not rely on sub-second accuracy for Timers.
We recommend that you consider the duration as a minimum time, one which will be rounded up slightly due to the latency involved with scheduling and firing the Timer.
For example, setting a Timer for 11.97 seconds is guaranteed to delay execution for at least that long, but will likely be closer to 12 seconds in practice.

Start Delay Workflow Execution is incompatible with both [Schedules](/schedule) and [Cron Jobs](/cron-job).

:::

Start Delay determines the amount of time to wait before initiating a Workflow Execution.
This is useful if you have a Workflow you want to schedule out in the future, but only want it to execute once: in comparison to reoccurring Workflows using Schedules.

If the Workflow receives a Signal-With-Start during the delay, it dispatches a Workflow Task and the remaining delay is bypassed.
If the Workflow receives a Signal during the delay that is not a Signal-With-Start, the Signal does not interrupt the delay, and the Workflow continues to be delayed until the delay expires or a Signal-With-Start is received.

You can delay the dispatch of the initial Workflow Execution by setting this option in the Workflow Options field of your chosen SDK.
This delay only applies to the initial Workflow Execution and does not affect subsequent executions, such as when the Workflow Continues-as-New.
