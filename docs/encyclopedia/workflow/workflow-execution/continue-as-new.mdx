This page discusses [Continue-As-New](#continue-as-new) and how to tell [when](#when) you would want to use it.

Continue-As-New allows you to checkpoint your Workflow's state and start a fresh Workflow.

There are two main problems this practice can prevent:

- A Workflow Execution with a long, or large [Event History](workflow-execution#event-history), such as one calling many activities, may bog down and have performance issues.
  It could even generate more events than allowed by the [Event History limits](/encyclopedia/workflow/workflow-execution/events#event-history-limits).
- A Workflow Execution can hit [Workflow Versioning](/workflow-definition#workflow-versioning) problems if it started running on an older version of your code.

## What is Continue-As-New? {#continue-as-new}

Continue-As-New lets you checkpoint the latest relevant state in a Workflow Execution and pass it to a new Execution in the [Execution Chain](/workflow-execution#workflow-execution-chain).
This state is passed in through your Workflow's parameters.
The parameters are typically optional and left unset by the original caller of the Workflow.

The new Workflow Execution has the same Workflow Id, but a different Run Id, and starts its own Event History.

You can repeat Continue-As-New as often as needed, which means that your Workflow can run in perpetuity.
Workflows that do this are often called Entity Workflows because they represent durable objects, not just processes.

## When is it right to Continue-As-New? {#when}

To prevent scalability problems, periodically check Continue As New Suggested in your Workflow.\
Temporal will tell your Workflow when it's approaching performance or scalability problems.

To help prevent versioning problems for long-running Workflows, you may also want to Continue-as-New after a certain amount of time has elapsed. This will make sure every Workflow began on a recent version of your source code.
