#### What is Continue-As-New? {#continue-as-new}

Continue-As-New is a mechanism by which the latest relevant state is passed to a new Workflow Execution, with a fresh Event History.

:::caution

As a precautionary measure, the Workflow Execution's Event History is limited to [51,200 Events](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/e3496b1c51bfaaae8142b78e4032cc791de8a76f/service/history/configs/config.go#L382) or [50 MB](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/e3496b1c51bfaaae8142b78e4032cc791de8a76f/service/history/configs/config.go#L380) and will warn you after 10,240 Events or 10 MB.

:::

To prevent a Workflow Execution Event History from exceeding this limit and failing, use Continue-As-New to start a new Workflow Execution with a fresh Event History.

All values passed to a Workflow Execution through parameters or returned through a result value are recorded into the Event History.
The Temporal Service stores the full Event History of a Workflow Execution for the duration of a Namespace's retention period.
A Workflow Execution that periodically executes many Activities has the potential of hitting the size limit.

A very large Event History can adversely affect the performance of a Workflow Execution.
For example, in the case of a Workflow Worker failure, the full Event History must be pulled from the Temporal Service and given to another Worker via a Workflow Task.
If the Event history is very large, it may take some time to load it.

The Continue-As-New feature enables developers to complete the current Workflow Execution and start a new one atomically.

The new Workflow Execution has the same Workflow Id, but a different Run Id, and has its own Event History.

In the case of [Temporal Cron Jobs](/cron-job), Continue-As-New is actually used internally for the same effect.
