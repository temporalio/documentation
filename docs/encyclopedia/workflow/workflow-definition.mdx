A Temporal Workflow defines the overall flow of the application.
Conceptually, a Workflow is a sequence of steps written in a general-purpose programming language.
With Temporal, those steps are defined by writing code, known as a Workflow Definition, and are carried out by running that code, which results in a Workflow Execution.

In day-to-day conversations, the term _Workflow_ might refer to [Workflow Type](#workflow-type), a [Workflow Definition](/workflow-definition), or a [Workflow Execution](/workflow-execution).
Temporal documentation aims to be explicit and differentiate between them.

## What is a Workflow Definition? {#workflow-definition}

A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the Workflow.
It is written with a programming language and corresponding Temporal SDK.
Depending on the programming language, it's typically implemented as a function or an object method and encompasses the end-to-end series of steps of a Temporal application.

Below are different ways to develop a basic Workflow Definition.

A Workflow Definition may be also referred to as a Workflow Function.
In Temporal's documentation, a Workflow Definition refers to the source for the instance of a Workflow Execution, while a Workflow Function refers to the source for the instance of a Workflow Function Execution.

A Workflow Execution effectively executes once to completion, while a Workflow Function Execution occurs many times during the life of a Workflow Execution.

We strongly recommend that you write a Workflow Definition in a language that has a corresponding Temporal SDK.

### Deterministic constraints {#deterministic-constraints}

A critical aspect of developing Workflow Definitions is ensuring they exhibit certain deterministic traits â€“ that is, making sure that the same Commands are emitted in the same sequence, whenever a corresponding Workflow Function Execution (instance of the Function Definition) is re-executed.

The execution semantics of a Workflow Execution include the re-execution of a Workflow Function, which is called a [Replay](/workflow-execution#replay).
The use of Workflow APIs in the function is what generates [Commands](/workflow-execution#command).
Commands tell the Temporal Service which Events to create and add to the Workflow Execution's [Event History](/workflow-execution/event#event-history).
When a Workflow Function executes, the Commands that are emitted are compared with the existing Event History.
If a corresponding Event already exists within the Event History that maps to the generation of that Command in the same sequence, and some specific metadata of that Command matches with some specific metadata of the Event, then the Function Execution progresses.

For example, using an SDK's "Execute Activity" API generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands#scheduleactivitytask) Command.
When this API is called upon re-execution, that Command is compared with the Event that is in the same location within the sequence.
The Event in the sequence must be an [ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events#activitytaskscheduled) Event, where the Activity name is the same as what is in the Command.

If a generated Command doesn't match what it needs to in the existing Event History, then the Workflow Execution returns a _non-deterministic_ error.

The following are the two reasons why a Command might be generated out of sequence or the wrong Command might be generated altogether:

1. Code changes are made to a Workflow Definition that is in use by a running Workflow Execution.
2. There is intrinsic non-deterministic logic (such as inline random branching).

### Code changes can cause non-deterministic behavior {#non-deterministic-change}

The Workflow Definition can change in very limited ways once there is a Workflow Execution depending on it.
To alleviate non-deterministic issues that arise from code changes, we recommend using [Workflow Versioning](#workflow-versioning).

For example, let's say we have a Workflow Definition that defines the following sequence:

1. Start and wait on a Timer/sleep.
2. Spawn and wait on an Activity Execution.
3. Complete.

We start a Worker and spawn a Workflow Execution that uses that Workflow Definition.
The Worker would emit the [StartTimer](/references/commands#starttimer) Command and the Workflow Execution would become suspended.

Before the Timer is up, we change the Workflow Definition to the following sequence:

1. Spawn and wait on an Activity Execution.
2. Start and wait on a Timer/sleep.
3. Complete.

When the Timer fires, the next Workflow Task will cause the Workflow Function to re-execute.
The first Command the Worker sees would be ScheduleActivityTask Command, which wouldn't match up to the expected [TimerStarted](/references/events#timerstarted) Event.

The Workflow Execution would fail and return a nondeterminism error.

The following are examples of minor changes that would not result in non-determinism errors when re-executing a History which already contain the Events:

- Changing the duration of a Timer, with the following exceptions:
  - In Java, Python, and Go, changing a Timer's duration from or to 0 is a non-deterministic behavior.
  - In .NET, changing a Timer's duration from or to -1 (which means "infinite") is a non-deterministic behavior.
- Changing the arguments to:
  - The Activity Options in a call to spawn an Activity Execution (local or nonlocal).
  - The Child Workflow Options in a call to spawn a Child Workflow Execution.
  - Call to Signal an External Workflow Execution.
- Adding a Signal Handler for a Signal Type that has not been sent to this Workflow Execution.

### Intrinsic non-deterministic logic {#intrinsic-nondeterministic-logic}

Intrinsic non-determinism is when a Workflow Function Execution might emit a different sequence of Commands on re-execution, regardless of whether all the input parameters are the same.

For example, a Workflow Definition can not have inline logic that branches (emits a different Command sequence) based off a local time setting or a random number.
In the representative pseudocode below, the `local_clock()` function returns the local time, rather than Temporal-defined time:

```text
fn your_workflow() {
  if local_clock().is_before("12pm") {
    await workflow.sleep(duration_until("12pm"))
  } else {
    await your_afternoon_activity()
  }
}
```

Each Temporal SDK offers APIs that enable Workflow Definitions to have logic that gets and uses time, random numbers, and data from unreliable resources.
When those APIs are used, the results are stored as part of the Event History, which means that a re-executed Workflow Function will issue the same sequence of Commands, even if there is branching involved.

In other words, all operations that do not purely mutate the Workflow Execution's state should occur through a Temporal SDK API.

### Versioning Workflow code {#workflow-versioning}

The Temporal Platform requires that Workflow code (Workflow Definitions) be deterministic in nature.
This requirement means that developers should consider how they plan to handle changes to Workflow code over time.

A versioning strategy is even more important if your Workflow Executions live long enough that a Worker must be able to execute multiple versions of the same Workflow Type.

Apart from the ability to create new Task Queues for Workflow Types with the same name, the Temporal Platform provides Workflow Patching APIs and Worker Build Idâ€“based versioning features.

#### Patching

Patching APIs enable the creation of logical branching inside a Workflow Definition based on a developer-specified version identifier.
This feature is useful for Workflow Definition logic that needs to be updated but still has running Workflow Executions that depend on it.

- [How to patch Workflow code in PHP](/develop/php/versioning#php-sdk-patching-api)
- [How to patch Workflow code in TypeScript](/develop/typescript/versioning#patching)
- [How to patch Workflow code in .NET](/develop/dotnet/versioning#dotnet-sdk-patching-api)

You can also use [Worker Versioning](/worker-versioning) instead of Patching.

### Handling unreliable Worker Processes {#unreliable-worker-processes}

You do not handle Worker Process failure or restarts in a Workflow Definition.

Workflow Function Executions are completely oblivious to the Worker Process in terms of failures or downtime.
The Temporal Platform ensures that the state of a Workflow Execution is recovered and progress resumes if there is an outage of either Worker Processes or the Temporal Service itself.
The only reason a Workflow Execution might fail is due to the code throwing an error or exception, not because of underlying infrastructure outages.

### What is a Workflow Type? {#workflow-type}

A Workflow Type is a name that maps to a Workflow Definition.

- A single Workflow Type can be instantiated as multiple Workflow Executions.
- A Workflow Type is scoped by a Task Queue.
  It is acceptable to have the same Workflow Type name map to different Workflow Definitions if they are using completely different Workers.
