The Nexus API Registry is an account-scoped list of Nexus `Endpoints` available within an account.

Endpoints descriptions are rendered as markdown, and can include Service and Operation descriptions, and input/output types, so consumers know how to use the Services and Endpoint offers.

You can search the Nexus API registry for Endpoint name or an endpoint Target Namespace to quickly find an Endpoint of interest.

Creating a Nexus endpoint includes setting an Access Policy of caller Namespaces that can access the Endpoint. Even the Target Namespace must be added to the Access Policy to access the Endpoint. 

Editing a Nexus Endpoint allows changing everything but the Endpoint Name. The Target Namespace and Target Task Queue can be updated without interrupting existing in-flight Nexus Operations that are already being processed, and new Nexus Operations will be routed to the updated Target Namespace and Target Task Queue.

The Access Policy may also be edited to add or remove caller Namespaces that can access the Endpoint.
