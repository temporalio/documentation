The Nexus API Registry stores information about Nexus Endpoints. 
In self-hosted deployments, the registry is scoped to a cluster; while in Temporal Cloud, it is scoped to an account. 
Developers can advertise available endpoints and services, so others can find them for use in their caller Workflows.

Endpoint names must be unique within the registry. 
When the Temporal Service dispatches a Nexus request, it resolves the request's Endpoint to a Target Namespace and Task Queue via the Nexus API Registry.

You can search the Nexus API registry for Endpoint name or an endpoint Target Namespace to quickly find an Endpoint of interest.

Creating a Nexus Endpoint includes setting an Access Policy of caller Namespaces that can access the Endpoint. 
Even the Target Namespace must be added to the Access Policy to access the Endpoint. 

Editing a Nexus Endpoint allows changing everything but the Endpoint Name. 
The Target Namespace and Target Task Queue can be updated without interrupting existing in-flight Nexus Operations that are already being processed, and new Nexus Operations will be routed to the updated Target Namespace and Target Task Queue.

The Access Policy may also be edited to add or remove caller Namespaces that can access the Endpoint.
