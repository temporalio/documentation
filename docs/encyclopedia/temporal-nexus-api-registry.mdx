### Nexus API Registry {#nexus-api-registry}

The Nexus API Registry is an account-scoped list of Nexus `Endpoints` available within an account.
Endpoints descriptions are rendered as markdown, and can include Service and Operation descriptions, and input/output types, so consumers know how to use the Services and Endpoint offers.
