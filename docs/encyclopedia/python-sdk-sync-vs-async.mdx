The Temporal Python SDK supports multiple ways of implementing an Activity:

- Asynchronously using [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- Synchronously multithreaded using [`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor)
- Synchronously multiprocess using [`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor) and [`multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager)

It is important to implement your Activities using the correct method, otherwise
your application may fail in sporadic and unexpected ways. Which one you should
use depends on your use case. This section provides guidance to help you choose
the best approach.

## The Python Asynchronous Event Loop and Blocking Calls

First, let's look at how async event loops work in Python. The Python async
event loop runs in a thread and executes all tasks in its thread. When any
task is running in the event loop, the loop is blocked and no other tasks can be
running at the same time within that event loop. Whenever a task executes an
`await` expression, the task is suspended, and the event loop begins or resumes
execution of another task.

This means that the event loop can only pass the flow of control when the `await`
keyword is executed. If a program makes a blocking call, such as one that reads
from a file, makes a synchronous request to a network service, waits for user input,
or anything else that blocks the execution, the entire event loop must wait until
that execution has completed.

Blocking the async event loop in Python would turn your asynchronous program
into a synchronous program that executes serially, defeating the entire purpose
of using `asyncio`. This can also lead to potential deadlock, and unpredictable behavior
that causes tasks to be unable to execute. Debugging these issues can be difficult
and time consuming, as locating the source of the blocking call might not always
be immediately obvious.

Due to this, Python developers must be extra careful to not make blocking calls
from within an asynchronous Activity, or use an async safe library to perform
these actions.

For example, making an HTTP call with the popular `requests` library within an
asynchronous Activity would lead to blocking your event loop. If you want to make
an HTTP call from within an asynchronous Activity, you should use an async-safe HTTP library
such as `aiohttp` or `httpx`. Otherwise, use a synchronous Activity.

## Implementing Asynchronous Activities

The following code is an asynchronous Activity Definition that's similar to one
you will use during an upcoming exercise. Like the Workflow Definition
you've already run, it takes a name (`str`) as input and returns a
customized greeting (`str`) as output. However, this Activity makes
a call to a microservice, accessed through HTTP, to request this
greeting in Spanish. This activity uses the `aiohttp` library to make an async
safe HTTP request. Using the `requests` library here would have resulting in
blocking code within the async event loop, which will block the entire async
event loop. For more in-depth information about this issue, refer to the
[Python asyncio documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-dev.html#running-blocking-code).

The code below also implements the Activity Definition as a class, rather than a
function. The `aiohttp` library requires an established `Session` to perform the
HTTP request. It would be inefficient to establish a `Session` every time an
Activity is invoked, so instead this code accepts a `Session` object as an instance
parameter and makes it available to the methods. This approach will also be
beneficial when the execution is over and the `Session` needs to be closed.

In this example, the Activity supplies the name in the URL and retrieves
the greeting from the body of the response.

```python
import aiohttp
import urllib.parse
from temporalio import activity

class TranslateActivities:
    def __init__(self, session: aiohttp.ClientSession):
        self.session = session

    @activity.defn
    async def greet_in_spanish(self, name: str) -> str:
        greeting = await self.call_service("get-spanish-greeting", name)
        return greeting

    # Utility method for making calls to the microservices
    async def call_service(self, stem: str, name: str) -> str:
        base = f"http://localhost:9999/{stem}"
        url = f"{base}?name={urllib.parse.quote(name)}"

        async with self.session.get(url) as response:
            translation = await response.text()

            if response.status >= 400:
                raise ApplicationError(
                    f"HTTP Error {response.status}: {translation}",
                    # We want to have Temporal automatically retry 5xx but not 4xx
                    non_retryable=response.status < 500,
                )

            return translation
```

## Implementing Synchronous Activities

The following code is an implementation of the above Activity, but as a
synchronous Activity Definition. When making the call to the microservice,
you'll notice that it uses the `requests` library. This is safe to do in
synchronous Activities.

```python
import urllib.parse
import requests
from temporalio import activity

class TranslateActivities:

    @activity.defn
    def greet_in_spanish(self, name: str) -> str:
        greeting = self.call_service("get-spanish-greeting", name)
        return greeting

    # Utility method for making calls to the microservices
    def call_service(self, stem: str, name: str) -> str:
        base = f"http://localhost:9999/{stem}"
        url = f"{base}?name={urllib.parse.quote(name)}"

        response = requests.get(url)
        return response.text
```

In the above example we chose not to share a session across the Activity, so
`__init__` was removed. While `requests` does have the ability to create sessions,
it is currently unknown if they are thread safe. Due to no longer having or needing
`__ini__`, the case could be made here to not implement the Activities as a class,
but just as decorated functions as shown below:

```python
@activity.defn
def greet_in_spanish(name: str) -> str:
    greeting = call_service("get-spanish-greeting", name)
    return greeting

# Utility method for making calls to the microservices
def call_service(stem: str, name: str) -> str:
    base = f"http://localhost:9999/{stem}"
    url = f"{base}?name={urllib.parse.quote(name)}"

    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.text
```

Whether to implement Activities as class methods or functions is a design choice
choice left up to the developer when cross-activity state is not needed. Both are
equally valid implementations.

## When Should You Use Async Activities

Asynchronous Activities have many advantages, such as potential speed up of execution.
However, as discussed above, making unsafe calls within the async event loop
can cause sporadic and difficult to diagnose bugs. For this reason, we recommend
using asynchronous Activities _only_ when you are certain that your Activities
are async safe and don't make blocking calls.

If you experience bugs that you think may be a result of an unsafe call being made in an asynchronous Activity, convert it to a synchronous Activity and see if the issue resolves.
