:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is now [Generally Available](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#general-availability) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

Common patterns for building and deploying [Nexus Services](/nexus/services).

## Collocated pattern (default) {#collocated-pattern}

The **collocated pattern** runs Nexus Operation handlers in the same Worker and on the same Task Queue as the Workflows they abstract.
This is the default and simplest deployment topology.

The Nexus Endpoint's target Task Queue points to the same Task Queue used by the underlying Workflows.
The same Worker process registers both Nexus Services and Workflow types, so everything runs together.

### Why start here

- **Simplest setup:** One Worker, one Task Queue, one deployment. No extra infrastructure.
- **Eager Workflow Start:** When the handler starts a Workflow in the same Worker process, [Eager Workflow Start](/develop/worker-performance#eager-workflow-start) can reserve a slot and execute the first Workflow Task locally without an extra round trip to the Temporal Service - while still recording durable state. If the process crashes, the Workflow resumes on another Worker.
- **Clean facade:** Operations act as a stable contract. You can change the underlying implementation (Signal today, Workflow tomorrow) without impacting callers.

### When to use this pattern

- Getting started with Nexus.
- The handler team owns both the Nexus Service and the underlying Workflows.
- No need to scale Nexus routing separately from Workflow execution.

### When to move on

When you need separate scaling, different IAM permissions per Worker fleet, or want to add Nexus to existing Workers without modifying them, see the [router-queue pattern](#router-queue-pattern).

## Router-queue pattern

The **router-queue pattern** separates Nexus routing from Workflow execution: a dedicated Nexus Worker on a "router" Task Queue routes Operations to Workflows on different Task Queues in the same Namespace.

### When to use this pattern

- **Separate scaling:** Scale Nexus routing independently from Workflow execution.
- **Dedicated routing layer:** A single Nexus Worker routes requests to multiple Workflow types on different Task Queues.
- **Different IAM permissions:** Worker fleets behind different Task Queues may have different IAM permissions to different underlying resources.
- **Avoid modifying existing Workers:** Add a router Worker to a Namespace without changing any existing Workers or Workflows.

### How it works

1. Register a Nexus Worker that polls a dedicated "router" Task Queue.
2. Configure the Nexus Endpoint's target Task Queue to point to this router Task Queue.
3. In each Nexus Operation handler, specify a different target Task Queue in the Workflow start options.
4. Existing Workers continue to poll their own Task Queues and execute the Workflows started by the router.

### Production usage

Used in production by organizations running self-service platforms where a central gateway routes requests to domain-specific Namespaces and Task Queues.
The router Worker is lightweight - it only handles routing logic.
