:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is now [Generally Available](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#general-availability) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

:::

The [Nexus Registry](/glossary#nexus-registry) is used to view and manage [Nexus Endpoints](/nexus/endpoints).
Adding a Nexus Endpoint to the Nexus Registry deploys the Endpoint, so it is available at runtime to serve Nexus requests.

:::info

The Nexus Registry is scoped to an Account in Temporal Cloud and scoped to a Cluster for self-hosted deployments.

:::

Developers can advertise available Endpoints and Services, so others can find them for use in their caller Workflows.
Endpoint names must be unique within the Nexus Registry.

## View and Manage Nexus Endpoints

Nexus Endpoints may be managed using the Temporal UI, the CLI, or the [Cloud Ops API](/ops).

:::tip RESOURCES

- [tcld nexus](/cloud/tcld/nexus) for Temporal Cloud.
- [temporal operator nexus](/cli/operator#nexus) for self-hosted deployments.
  :::

### Search for a Nexus Endpoint

You can search the Nexus Registry for Endpoint name or an Endpoint's target Namespace to quickly find an Endpoint of interest.

    title="Nexus Endpoints"
/>

The Endpoint details page shows the target Namespace and target Task Queue along with the endpoint description rendered as markdown.

/>

### Create a Nexus Endpoint

Creating a Nexus Endpoint includes setting an Access Policy of caller Namespaces that can access the Endpoint.
Even the target Namespace must be added to the Access Policy to access the Endpoint.
Temporal Cloud also provides built-in Endpoint access control in the form of a caller Namespace allowlist, which must be set for any caller to access a Nexus Endpoint, even if in the same Namespace.

/>

### Edit a Nexus Endpoint

Editing a Nexus Endpoint allows changing everything but the Endpoint Name.
The target Namespace and target Task Queue can be updated without interrupting existing in-flight Nexus Operations that are already being processed, and new Nexus Operations will be routed to the updated target Namespace and target Task Queue.

/>

### Configure runtime access controls

Configure the Endpoint's Access Policy to control which callers can access a Nexus Endpoint at runtime.

<CaptionedImage
    src="/img/cloud/nexus/create-nexus-endpoint-ss.png"
    title="Configure runtime access controls"
/>

The Access Policy allows specifying the caller Namespaces that can use Nexus Services on an Endpoint at runtime.

No callers are allowed by default, even if the caller is in the same Namespace as the Endpoint target.

See [Runtime Access Controls](/nexus/security#runtime-access-controls) for more information.

## Roles and permissions

:::info

Temporal Cloud has built-in Nexus security. For self-hosted deployments you can implement [custom Authorizers](/self-hosted-guide/security#authorizer-plugin).

:::

In Temporal Cloud, access to the Nexus Registry is controlled with the following roles and permissions:

- View, list, and search Nexus Endpoints:
  - Read-only role (or higher) in an Account
- Manage a Nexus Endpoint (create, edit, delete) requires **both**:
  - Developer role (or higher) in an Account
  - Namespace Admin permission on the Endpoint's target Namespace

  See [Nexus Security in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus/security) for more information.
