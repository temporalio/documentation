In this Temporal Nexus guide, you'll find the following information:

Building distributed applications of any size often requires a modular architecture and multiple teams collaborating, with each responsible for their slice of the overall application.

Teams would like to build, operate, and deliver in an autonomous manner while allowing their slice to be used by other teams – but they also want the improved security and blast-radius isolation of separate Namespaces.

Existing solutions to modularize a Temporal Application have several challenges:

- Direct Workflow to Workflow integration is a leaky abstraction
  - caller must know the target Namespace, Task Queue, Workflow policy & types
  - tightly couples caller and handler
  - difficult for handler to change to a different Task Queue or Namespace
  - no service facade to refactor behind \- direct coupling to Workflow implementation
- Child Workflows don’t work across Namespace boundaries in Temporal Cloud
  - Namespaces can live in any cloud cell
  - Child Workflows don’t support cross-cluster calls
- Activities that use the Temporal client to invoke Workflows in a different Namespace
  - cost to build and run Activity wrappers in each caller Namespace
  - mTLS client certs must be exchanged and rotated
  - callers get full access, so no control over what is available for other teams to use.

Teams have faced a difficult choice:

- multiple Namespaces \- using Activity wrappers with the limitations above
- single large monolithic Namespace \- with Child Workflows but no Namespace isolation

Higher-level Temporal primitives are needed to provide a clean interface across team boundaries and a clean separation of concerns – in a way that supports durable execution across each team’s slice of a Temporal Application.
