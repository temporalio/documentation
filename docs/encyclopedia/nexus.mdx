:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is now [Generally Available](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#general-availability) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

:::info NEW TO NEXUS?

This page explains what Nexus is and how it works. To evaluate whether Nexus fits your use case, see the [evaluation guide](/evaluate/nexus).

## What is Nexus?

Nexus connects Temporal Applications across (and within) isolated Namespaces.
Each team gets their own Namespace for security and fault isolation, while exposing a clean service contract for others to use through a [Nexus Endpoint](/nexus/endpoints).

Designed for Durable Execution, Nexus combines a familiar SDK programming model with reliable execution, built-in observability, and multi-region connectivity in Temporal Cloud.

Nexus is peer-to-peer, not hierarchical.
Caller and handler Workflows are siblings that communicate across Namespace boundaries.

## How Nexus works

### Services and Operations

A [Nexus Service](/nexus/services) is a named collection of [Nexus Operations](/nexus/operations) that a team exposes.
Operations abstract the underlying implementation - callers don't need to know whether an Operation starts a Workflow, sends a Signal, runs a Query, or executes other reliable code.

The [Operation lifecycle](/nexus/operations#operation-lifecycle) supports two modes:

- **Asynchronous** - Starts a Workflow (same or different Task Queue, with optional [Eager Start](/develop/worker-performance#eager-workflow-start)). Can run up to [60 days](/cloud/limits#nexus-operation-duration-limits).
- **Synchronous** - Completes within the [10-second handler deadline](/cloud/limits#nexus-operation-request-timeout). Use for Signals, Queries, Updates, or other reliable low-latency calls using the [Temporal SDK Client](/nexus/operations#executing-arbitrary-code-from-a-sync-handler).

Services and Operations are built with the Temporal SDK and typically [collocated](/nexus/patterns#collocated-pattern) in the same Worker as the Temporal primitives they abstract, or in a dedicated router Worker using the [router-queue pattern](/nexus/patterns#router-queue-pattern).

### Endpoints and Registry

A [Nexus Endpoint](/nexus/endpoints) is a reverse proxy that decouples callers from handlers.
Callers reference an Endpoint by name. The Endpoint routes requests to a target Namespace and Task Queue.
Callers never need to know the handler's Namespace, Task Queue, or internal implementation.

Endpoints are managed in the [Nexus Registry](/nexus/registry) using the UI, CLI, or Cloud Ops API.

### Queue-based Worker architecture

Nexus uses the same queue-based Worker architecture as the rest of Temporal.
Handler Workers poll the Endpoint's target Task Queue for [Nexus Tasks](/tasks#nexus-task).
If a Nexus Service is down, caller Workflows continue to schedule Operations - they process when the service is back up.
No bespoke service deployments needed. Load balancing is automatic.

See [system interactions](/nexus/operations#system-interactions) for the full request flow.

### Built-in Nexus Machinery

When a caller Workflow executes a Nexus Operation, the [Nexus Machinery](/glossary#nexus-machinery) handles delivery with [at-least-once](/nexus/operations#execution-semantics) execution:

- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting and concurrency limiting
- [Circuit breaking](/nexus/operations#circuit-breaking) (trips after 5 consecutive retryable errors)
- Automatic load balancing

The Machinery uses [Nexus RPC](/glossary#nexus-rpc) on the wire - a protocol supporting arbitrary-duration Operations.
You interact only with the Temporal SDK, not Nexus RPC directly.

### Multi-level calls

Nexus calls chain across teams and Namespaces:

- Workflow A -> Nexus Op 1 -> Workflow B -> Nexus Op 2 -> Workflow C

## Operational reference

- [Nexus security](/nexus/security) - Access controls, secure connectivity, and payload encryption.
- [Nexus execution debugging](/nexus/execution-debugging) - Bi-directional linking, pending Operations, and tracing.
- [Nexus error handling](/nexus/error-handling) - Error types and how they surface in caller Workflows.
- [Nexus metrics](/nexus/metrics) - SDK, Cloud, and OSS cluster metrics.
