Please note an important update in our terminology.

We now refer to the Temporal Cluster as the Temporal Service.

This guide provides a comprehensive technical overview of a Temporal Service.

A Temporal Service is the group of services, known as the [Temporal Server](/temporal-service/temporal-server), combined with [Persistence](/temporal-service/persistence) and [Visibility](/temporal-service/visibility) stores, that together act as a component of the Temporal Platform.

See the Self-hosted Temporal Service [production deployment guide](/self-hosted-guide) for implementation guidance.
