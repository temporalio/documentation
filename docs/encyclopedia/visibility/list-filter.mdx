This page discusses [List Filter](#list-filter).

## What is a List Filter? {#list-filter}

The [Visibility](/clusters#visibility) List API requires you to provide a List Filter as an SQL-like string parameter.

A List Filter includes [Search Attribute](#search-attribute) names, Search Attribute values, and [operators](#supported-operators) so that it can retrieve a filtered list of Workflow Executions from the Visibility Store.

List Filter [Search Attribute](#search-attribute) names are case sensitive.
A single [Namespace](/namespaces) scopes each List Filter.

A List Filter using a time range provides a resolution of 1 ns on [Elasticsearch](/self-hosted-guide/visibility#elasticsearch) and 1 µs for [SQL databases](/self-hosted-guide/visibility).

### Supported operators

List Filters support the following operators:

- **`=, !=, >, >=, <, <=`**
- **`AND, OR, ()`**
- **`BETWEEN ... AND`**
- **`IN`**
- **STARTS_WITH**

{/* - **ORDER BY** */}

The **ORDER BY** operator is currently not supported in Temporal Cloud.

Custom Search Attributes of the `Text` type cannot be used in **ORDER BY** clauses.

### Partial string match

There are different options for partial string matching when the type of the Search Attribute is [Text](#text) versus [Keyword](#keyword).

#### Text

Search Attributes of type `Text` are [broken up into words](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-standard-tokenizer.html) that match with the `=` operator.

For example, if you have a custom `Text` Search Attribute named `Description` with either of the following values—

```
my-business-id-foobar
my business id foobar
```

—then the following List Filter matches—

```
Description = 'foobar'
```

—but a partial word does not:

```
// Doesn't match
Description = 'foo'
```

#### Keyword

For Search Attributes of type `Keyword` like `WorkflowId`, perform partial string matching using STARTS_WITH for prefixes and BETWEEN for suffixes.

* `WorkflowId STARTS_WITH "order-"` matches Workflow Ids with the "order-" prefix, regardless of the following text.

  ```
  order-
  order-1234
  order-abracadabra
  order-~~~abracadabra
  ```

* `WorkflowId BETWEEN "order-" AND "order-~"` matches Workflow Ids that have characters after `order-` with ASCII values lower than `~` (126, the highest-value printable character), such as the following:

  ```
  order-
  order-1234
  order-abracadabra
  ```

  It does not match `order-~~`.

:::note Filter Composition Quick Reference

**Composition**

- Data types:
  - String literals with single or double quotes
  - Numbers (Integer and Floating Point)
  - Booleans
- Comparison: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
- Expressions/Operators:
  - `IN array`
  - `BETWEEN value AND value`
  - `STARTS_WITH string`
  - `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`
  - `expr AND expr`, `expr OR expr`, `( expr )`
- Array: `( comma-separated-values )`

**Please note**

- Wrap attributes with backticks if it contains characters not in
  `[a-zA-Z0-9]`.
- `STARTS_WITH` is only available for Keyword search attributes.

### Efficient API usage

If the Advanced List Filter API retrieves a substantial number of Workflow Executions (more than 10,000), the response time might be longer.

Beginning with Temporal Server v1.20, you can employ the `CountWorkflow` API to efficiently count the number of [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution).

To paginate the results using the `ListWorkflow` API, use the page token to retrieve the next page.
Continue until the page token becomes `null`/`nil`.

#### List Filter examples

Here are examples of List Filters set with the [Temporal CLI](/cli/workflow#list):

```
WorkflowType = "main.YourWorkflowDefinition" and ExecutionStatus != "Running" and (StartTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or CloseTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34-08:00")
```

When you use the preceding example, you receive a list of Workflows fulfilling the following criteria:

- Workflow Type is `main.YourWorkflowDefinition`.
- Workflow isn't in a running state.
- Workflow either started after "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or closed after "2021-06-07T16:46:34-08:00".

The following are additional examples of List Filters.

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' or WorkflowId = '<another-workflow-id>'
```

```sql
WorkflowId IN ('<workflow-id>', '<another-workflow-id>')
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' and ExecutionStatus = 'Running'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' or ExecutionStatus = 'Running'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' and StartTime > '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
ExecutionTime between '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00' and '2021-08-28T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
ExecutionTime < '2021-08-28T15:04:05+00:00' or ExecutionTime > '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
WorkflowType STARTS_WITH '<workflow-type-prefix>'
```

{/*

```sql
order by ExecutionTime
```

```sql
order by StartTime desc, CloseTime asc
```

```sql
order by CustomIntField asc
```
