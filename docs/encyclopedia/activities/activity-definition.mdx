This page discusses the following:

- [Activity Definition](#activity-definition)
- [Idempotency](#idempotency)
- [Constraints](#activity-constraints)
- [Parameters](#activity-parameters)
- [Activity Type](#activity-type)

In day-to-day conversation, the term _Activity_ denotes an [Activity Definition](/activity-definition), [Activity Type](/activity-definition#activity-type), or [Activity Execution](/activity-execution).
Temporal documentation aims to be explicit and differentiate between them.

## What is an Activity Definition? {#activity-definition}

An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an [Activity Task Execution](/tasks#activity-task-execution).
Activities encapsulate business logic that is prone to failure, allowing for automatic retries when issues occur.

The term 'Activity Definition' is used to refer to the full set of primitives in any given language SDK that provides an access point to an Activity Function Definition——the method or function that is invoked for an [Activity Task Execution](/tasks#activity-task-execution).
Therefore, the terms Activity Function and Activity Method refer to the source of an instance of an execution.

Activity Definitions are named and referenced in code by their [Activity Type](/activity-definition#activity-type).

### Idempotency {#idempotency}

Temporal recommends that Activities be idempotent.

Idempotence means that performing an operation multiple times has the same result as performing it once.
In the context of Temporal, Activities should be designed to be safely executed multiple times without causing unexpected or undesired side effects.

Consider the power button on your laptop. When you press it, the machine is changed from one state to the other, from on to off, and vice versa. This is not an idempotent operation. Each invocation leads to a different state. However, imagine that you modified your laptop to have separate on and off buttons. Pressing the On button multiple times would have no effect beyond the initial invocation as the laptop is already on. This action is considered idempotent.

Idempotency is an important design consideration in software applications as well. You have probably encountered idempotent operations in your work already.

A few examples where idempotent operations are vital would be:

- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool** - Conserving resources is important when you're provisioning infrastructure in the cloud. An IaC system that was not designed with idempotence in mind could lead to high costs if the function to provision a new server was accidentally invoked multiple times. An IaC tool that is designed with idempotence in mind ensures that multiple invocations of the tool doesn't lead to unintended instances being created.
- **Payment processing system** - A payment processing system must charge the customer only once for a given purchase. If the system was not designed to be idempotent, duplicate requests would result in extra charges and unhappy customers. A payment processing system that is designed to be idempotent ensures customers are not charged multiple times for the same transaction, preventing financial discrepancies.

:::info

By design, completed Activities will not re-execute as part of a [Workflow Replay](/workflow-execution#replay). However, Activities won’t record to the [Event History](/encyclopedia/retry-policies#event-history) until they return or produce an error. If an Activity fails to report to the server at all, it will be retried. Designing for idempotence, especially if you have a [Global Namespace](/global-namespace), will improve reusability and reliability.

:::

An Activity is idempotent if multiple [Activity Task Executions](/tasks#activity-task-execution) do not change the state of the system beyond the first Activity Task Execution.

The lack of idempotency might affect the correctness of your application but does not affect the Temporal Platform.
In other words, lack of idempotency doesn't lead to a platform error.

In some cases, whether something is idempotent doesn't affect the correctness of an application.
For example, if you have a monotonically incrementing counter, you might not care that retries increment the counter because you don't care about the actual value, only that the current value is greater than a previous value.

You should always make your business logic Activities idempotent in Temporal. Because Activities may be retried, these functions may be executed more than once. A non-idempotent Activity could adversely affect the state of the system.

Activities are an atomic unit of execution within Temporal. They are invoked and either complete successfully or not. Take this into consideration when you design your Activities.

For example, consider an Activity that has the following three steps:

1. Perform a database lookup
2. Make a call to a microservice with parameters retrieved from the database
3. Write the result of the microservice call to the filesystem

Imagine that the first two steps succeed, but the third step fails due to a permissions issue. During retry, the entire Activity—and therefore each of the three steps—is executed again. To maintain idempotency, design your Activities to be more granular. In this case, you could have three Activities, one for each step. This way, only the step that failed will be executed again. However, you must balance this against the potential for a larger Event History, since there would now be three Activity Executions instead of one.

Idempotence for Activities is also important due to a particular edge case inherent in distributed computing. Consider a scenario in which a Worker polls the Temporal Service, accepts the Activity Task, and begins executing the Activity. The Activity function completes successfully, but the Worker crashes just before it notifies the Temporal Service. In this case, the Event History won’t reflect the successful completion of the Task, so the Activity will be retried. If the Activity is not idempotent, this could have negative consequences, such as duplicate charges in a payment processing scenario.

For an Activity with a Retry Policy that permits retries, Temporal guarantees that the Activity will be observed as completed exactly once. However, the Activity may be executed multiple times and may even partially complete more than once during this process. This could lead to a scenario where certain parts of the Activity are executed multiple times before a successful execution is completed.

You can achieve idempotency in your application through the use of unique identifiers, known as idempotency keys, which are used to detect duplicate requests. These are enforced by the service you are calling from your Activity, not by the Activity itself.

For example, the APIs provided by most payment processors allow the client to include an idempotency key with the request. When the payment service receives a request, it checks a database to determine whether there has already been a request with this key. If so, the duplicate request is ignored and does not result in another charge. If not, then it writes a new record to the database with this key, allowing it to identify duplicate requests in the future.

In Temporal, the request to the payment service would be made from within an Activity. You can use a combination of the Workflow Run ID and the Activity ID as an idempotency key since this is guaranteed to be consistent across retry attempts but unique among Workflow Executions.

### Constraints {#activity-constraints}

Activity Definitions are executed as normal functions.

In the event of failure, the function begins at its initial state when retried (except when Activity Heartbeats are established).

Therefore, an Activity Definition has no restrictions on the code it contains.

### Parameters {#activity-parameters}

An Activity Definition can support as many parameters as needed.

All values passed through these parameters are recorded in the [Event History](/workflow-execution/event#event-history) of the Workflow Execution.
Return values are also captured in the Event History for the calling Workflow Execution.

Activity Definitions must contain the following parameters:

- Context: an optional parameter that provides Activity context within multiple APIs.
- Heartbeat: a notification from the Worker to the Temporal Service that the Activity Execution is progressing. Cancelations are allowed only if the Activity Definition permits Heartbeating.
- Timeouts: intervals that control the execution and retrying of Activity Task Executions.

Other parameters, such as [Retry Policies](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) and return values, can be seen in the implementation guides, listed in the next section.

## What is an Activity Type? {#activity-type}

An Activity Type is the mapping of a name to an Activity Definition.

Activity Types are scoped through Task Queues.
