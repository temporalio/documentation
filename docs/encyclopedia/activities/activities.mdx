This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Temporal Activities including [Activity Definition](/activity-definition), [Activity Type](/activity-definition#activity-type), [Activity Execution](/activity-execution), and [Local Activity](/local-activity).

An Activity is a normal function or method that executes a single, well-defined action (either short or long running), such as calling another service, transcoding a media file, or sending an email message.
Activity code can be non-deterministic.
We recommend that it be [idempotent](/activity-definition#idempotency).

Workflow code orchestrates the execution of Activities, persisting the results.
If an Activity Function Execution fails, any future execution starts from initial state (except [Heartbeats](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat)).

Activity Functions are executed by Worker Processes.
When the Activity Function returns, the Worker sends the results back to the Temporal Service as part of the [ActivityTaskCompleted](/references/events#activitytaskcompleted) Event.
The Event is added to the Workflow Execution's Event History.
For other Activity-related Events, see [Activity Events](/workflow-execution/event#activity-events).
