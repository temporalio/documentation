## Standalone Activity {#standalone-activity}

An [Activity Execution](/activity-execution) that is started directly by a [Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client), without using a Workflow, is called a Standalone Activity.

If you need to orchestrate multiple Activity Executions, then you should use a Workflow. But if you
just need to execute a single Activity, then you can use a Standalone Activity. This will result in
fewer [Billable Actions](/cloud/actions#actions-in-workflows) in Temporal Cloud. If your Activity
Execution is short-lived, then you will also notice lower latency, since there are fewer worker
round-trips than when executing the Activity in a Workflow.

Standalone Activities support the same retry policies and timeouts as Workflow Activities, and you
write your Activity Functions in the same way for both. In fact, an Activity Function can be
executed both as a Standalone Activity and as a Workflow Activity.
