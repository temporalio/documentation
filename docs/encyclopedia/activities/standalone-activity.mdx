## Standalone Activity {#standalone-activity}

An [Activity Execution](/activity-execution) that is started directly by a [Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client), without using a Workflow, is called a Standalone Activity.

If you need to orchestrate multiple Activity Executions, then you should use a Workflow.
But if you just need to execute a single Activity, then Standalone Activity will have lower latency and will result in fewer [Billable Actions](/cloud/actions) in Temporal Cloud.

Standalone Activities support the same retry policies and timeouts as Workflow Activities, and you write your Activity Functions in the same way for both.
In fact, an Activity Function can be executed both as a Standalone Activity and as a Workflow Activity.
