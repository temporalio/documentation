A Nexus `Endpoint` is like an API proxy that can serve one or more Nexus `Services` from a target Namespace and target Task Queue that a `Worker` is listening on.
This enables presenting a clean API contract and hiding the underlying Temporal implementation, which may consist of internal `Workflows`, `Signals`, and other Temporal primitives.

Adding a Nexus `Endpoint` to the API Registry allows Nexus Operation requests to be sent to the underlying target Namespace and Task Queue, using the name of the Endpoint in the API Registry.
Temporal Cloud also provides built-in Endpoint access control in the form of a caller Namespace allowlist, which must be set for any caller to access a Nexus Endpoint, even if in the same Namespace.

Multiple Nexus `Endpoints` can target the same target `Namespace`. 
For example, to decompose a monolithic Namespace into multiple Nexus Endpoints you can add multiple Nexus Endpoints that target the monolithic Namespace, and then update the Endpoints to target  different Target Namespaces later.
