A Nexus Endpoint is an addressable resource for routing Nexus requests from a caller Workflow to a target Namespace and Task Queue that a Worker is listening on. 
A Worker handles Nexus requests by registering one or more Nexus Services - a grouping of Operation Handlers.

Endpoints descriptions are rendered as Markdown, and can include Service and Operation descriptions, and input/output types, so consumers know how to use the Services and Endpoint offers.

Adding a Nexus `Endpoint` to the API Registry allows Nexus Operation requests to be sent to the underlying target Namespace and Task Queue, using the name of the Endpoint in the API Registry.
Temporal Cloud also provides built-in Endpoint access control in the form of a caller Namespace allowlist, which must be set for any caller to access a Nexus Endpoint, even if in the same Namespace.

Multiple Nexus `Endpoints` can target the same target `Namespace`. 
For example, to decompose a monolithic namespace into multiple Nexus Endpoints you can add multiple Nexus Endpoints that target the monolithic namespace, and then update the Endpoints to target  different Target Namespaces later.
