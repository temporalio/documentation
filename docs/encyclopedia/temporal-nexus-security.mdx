## Security with Temporal Nexus {#security}
The following page covers the following: 

- Nexus API Registry
- Runtime Access Control
- Secure Routing
- Payload Encryption & Data Converter


### Managing Nexus Endpoints in the Nexus API Registry

Like `Namespaces`, a Nexus `Endpoint` is an account-scoped resource that is global within your Temporal Cloud account.

Any `Developer` in an account, who is also a `Namespace Admin` on the endpoint’s target Namespace, can manage (create/update/delete) a Nexus `Endpoint`.\
All users with a `Read-only` role or higher in an account, can view and browse the full list of Endpoints.

### Runtime Access Control {#runtime-access-control}

Access to a Nexus `Endpoint` is controlled by an allowlist policy (of caller Namespaces) for each endpoint in the Nexus API registry.

Workers in each Namespace may authenticate with Temporal Cloud as they do today with mTLS certificates or the upcoming API key functionality. 
Once a Worker has authenticated it can send Nexus `Operation` commands to Temporal Cloud using a Temporal SDK to start a Nexus `Operation` in a different Namespace. 
For example in the Temporal Go SDK a caller Workflow would use `nexusClient.ExecuteOperation` to issue a command to start a Nexus `Operation`.

To process a `ScheduleNexusOperation` command from a caller Workflow, Temporal Cloud obtains the handler Namespace and Task Queue for the handler endpoint, and restricts access by verifying that the caller’s Namespace is in the endpoint’s allowlist.

In this way, Temporal Cloud acts as a trusted broker across Namespace boundaries, and relies on authenticated workers in each Namespace. 

### Secure Routing {#secure-routing}

In Temporal Cloud multiple security provisions are in place to ensure it can act as a trusted broker across Namespace boundaries:

- Workers authenticate to their Namespaces via mTLS or an API key as allowed by their Namespace configuration.
- mTLS is used for all Nexus communication, including across cloud cells and regions, to:
  - Start or Cancel a `Nexus Operation`.
  - Callback on completion of an asynchronous `Nexus Operation`.
- Nexus `Endpoints` are only privately accessible from within a Temporal Cloud account.
  - Accessible from within a caller Workflow using the Temporal SDK.
  - Not externally accessible for arbitrary clients yet.
- Future support for external Nexus `Endpoints` may have additional security measures such as:
  - Signed callback URLs with single-use tokens to prevent forgery and attenuate permissions, for use over public networks.

### Payload Encryption & Data Converter {#payload-encryption-&-data-converter}

The `DataConverter` works the same for a Nexus `Operation` as it does for other payloads sent between a Worker and Temporal Cloud. 
There is support for a single `DataConverter` to be used for inbound inputs and outbound outputs, which means the encryption key often used in a custom `DataConverter` must be the same for both the caller and the handler.
