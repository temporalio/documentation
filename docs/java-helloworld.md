This tutorial is aimed at developers who are new to [Temporal](/docs/overview), beginner Java programmers, or both. It will teach you how to build a simple "Hellow World!" Temporal Workflow application using the [Temporal Java SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/java-sdk) as well as a few basics, such as:

- How to set up your development environment and its dependencies.
- How to define an [Activity](/docs/activities) and a [Workflow](/docs/workflows).
- How to create and execute a Worker program and a Workflow starter program.
- Where to view Workflow details.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the tutorial [prerequisites](/docs/java-sdk-tutorial-prerequisites) setup.

## Project setup

Open IntelliJ and create a new Gradle project by following Step 1 of the [Getting started with Gradle guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started-with-gradle.html#create_project). Make sure your project is created inside the "temporal-java-tutorials" directory and name your project "helloworld-tutorial". It will take a few moments to complete.

Once Gradle has finished scaffolding you will need to customize the project dependencies. To do this, open the build.gradle file that is in the root of your project. Add the following lines to the dependencies section while replacing {version} with the most recent version listed on the [Temporal SDK Maven repository page](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.temporal/temporal-sdk):

```
implementation 'io.temporal:temporal-sdk:{version}'
implementation group: 'ch.qos.logback', name: 'logback-classic', version: '1.2.3'
```

The 'logback-classic' dependency will ensure that there is a logger to bind to within the SDK and prevent a default logger warning message.

A "refresh" icon will appear on the screen, click it to load the changes. Gradle will rebuild with the dependencies.

Lastly, to limit the logging output from the SDK, within src/main/resources create a logback.xml file and paste in the following XML:

<!--SNIPSTART java-samples-logback-dependency-configuration-->
```xml
<configuration>
    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <!-- encoders are assigned the type
             ch.qos.logback.classic.encoder.PatternLayoutEncoder by default -->
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>
    <logger name="io.grpc.netty" level="INFO"/>
    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
    </root>
</configuration>
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

## Build "Hello World!" app

Now we are ready to create our Temporal Workflow application.

Within src/main/java/ create the "helloworld" directory and within src/main/java/helloworld create the following files:

- HelloWorldActivity.java
- HelloWorldActivityImpl.java
- HelloWorldWorkflow.java
- HelloWorldWorkflowImpl.java
- HelloWorldStarter.java
- HelloWorldWorker.java

The following code snippets can be copied and pasted directly into your Java files. However, make sure that the first line of each file specifies the package name:

```java
package helloworld;
```

### Activity

First, let's define our Activity. Activities are meant to handle non-deterministic code that could result in unexpected results or errors. But for this tutorial all we are doing is taking a string, appending it to "Hello", and returning it back to the Workflow.

Open HelloWorldActivity.java and define the Activity interface:

<!--SNIPSTART java-hello-world-sample-activity-interface-->
```java
import io.temporal.activity.ActivityInterface;
import io.temporal.activity.ActivityMethod;

@ActivityInterface
public interface HelloWorldActivity {

  @ActivityMethod
  String composeGreeting(String name);
}
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

Next, open HelloWorldActivityImpl.java and implement the Activity:

<!--SNIPSTART java-hello-world-sample-activity-->
```java
public class HelloWorldActivityImpl implements HelloWorldActivity {

  @Override
  public String composeGreeting(String name) {
    // Append and strings and return the new one
    return "Hello " + name + "!";
  }
}
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

### Workflow

A Workflow is a special function that organizes the sequence of Activity executions. Opposed to an Activity, a Workflow is deterministic in nature. It is where you can specify Activity options, such as what to do if the Activity results in an error or when to time out the Activity execution. Since our Activity is just formatting strings we will only specify the required timeout.

Open HelloWorldWorkflow.java and define the Workflow interface:

<!--SNIPSTART java-hello-world-sample-workflow-interface-->
```java
import io.temporal.workflow.WorkflowInterface;
import io.temporal.workflow.WorkflowMethod;

@WorkflowInterface
public interface HelloWorldWorkflow {

  @WorkflowMethod
  String getGreeting(String name);
}
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

Open HelloWorldWorkflowImpl.java and define the Workflow:

<!--SNIPSTART java-hello-world-sample-workflow-->
```java
import io.temporal.activity.ActivityOptions;
import io.temporal.workflow.Workflow;
import java.time.Duration;

public class HelloWorldWorkflowImpl implements HelloWorldWorkflow {
  // Set the ActivityOptions
  ActivityOptions ao =
      ActivityOptions.newBuilder().setScheduleToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2)).build();
  // Create a new ActivityStub for the Activity
  private final HelloWorldActivity activity =
      Workflow.newActivityStub(HelloWorldActivity.class, ao);

  @Override
  public String getGreeting(String name) {
    // Execute the Activity within the Workflow method
    // If there were more Activities, they would be executed from within this method
    return activity.composeGreeting(name);
  }
}
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

### Starter

There are two ways to start a Workflow, either via the CLI or via a starter program. In this tutorial we will start our Workflow by invoking it with a starter program.

Open HelloWorldStarter.java and paste in the following code:

<!--SNIPSTART java-hello-world-sample-workflow-starter-->
```java
import io.temporal.client.WorkflowClient;
import io.temporal.client.WorkflowOptions;
import io.temporal.serviceclient.WorkflowServiceStubs;

public class HelloWorldStarter {

  public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {

    // gRPC stubs wrapper that talks to the local docker instance of temporal service.
    WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newInstance();
    // client that can be used to start and signal workflows
    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
    // Define the name of the Task Queue that the Workflow and Activity Tasks will be sent to
    final String TASK_QUEUE = "java-hello-world-task-queue";
    // Start a workflow execution.
    // Uses task queue from the GreetingWorkflow @WorkflowMethod annotation.
    HelloWorldWorkflow workflow =
        client.newWorkflowStub(
            HelloWorldWorkflow.class,
            WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).build());
    // Use the Workflow method to get the
    String greeting = workflow.getGreeting("World");
    // Print the greeting to the console
    System.out.println(greeting);
    // Exit the starter program
    System.exit(0);
  }
}
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

In the code above, we are creating a Temporal client and using it to host the Workflow with the Temporal server. Said another way, this starter program is sending the Workflow to the Temporal server where it will be broken into Tasks. The Tasks will be sent to the Task Queue that we supplied in the Workflow options.

### Worker

A Worker is the process that will actually execute the Workflow and Activity functions as Tasks.

Open HelloWorldWorker.java and paste in the following code:

<!--SNIPSTART java-hello-world-sample-worker-->
```java
import io.temporal.client.WorkflowClient;
import io.temporal.serviceclient.WorkflowServiceStubs;
import io.temporal.worker.Worker;
import io.temporal.worker.WorkerFactory;

public class HelloWorldWorker {

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    // Create a gRPC stubs wrapper that talks to the local docker instance of the Temporal service
    WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newInstance();
    // Create a Temporal Java SDK client
    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
    // Create a Worker factory that can be used to create Workers for specific Task Queues
    WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);
    // Define the name of the Task Queue that the Worker will listen to
    final String TASK_QUEUE = "java-hello-world-task-queue";
    // Create a Worker that listens on a Task Queue
    Worker worker = factory.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE);
    // This Worker hosts both Workflow and Activity implementations
    // Register the Workflow with the Worker
    // Workflows are stateful. So you need a type to create instances.
    worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(HelloWorldWorkflowImpl.class);
    // Register the Activity with the Worker
    // Activities are stateless and thread safe, so a shared instance is used.
    worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new HelloWorldActivityImpl());
    // Start listening to the Task Queue.
    factory.start();
  }
}
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

In this function we are creating a Temporal client and using it to create a new Worker. The Worker is registered to handle both HellowWorldWorkflow and HelloWorldActivity Tasks and is configured to listen to the same Task Queue that the Workflow and Activity Tasks are sent to.

## Run "Hello World!" app

At this stage you should have the Temporal server running in a terminal, have the [Temporal Web UI](localhost:8088) open in your browser, and have a project package directory that looks like this:

```
src/main/java/helloworld/
  - HelloWorldActivity
  - HelloWorldActivityImpl
  - HelloWorldStarter
  - HelloWorldWorker
  - HelloWorldWorkflow
  - HelloWorldWorkflowImpl
```

Within IntelliJ, right click on HelloWorldStarter and select Run. This will open a terminal inside of IntelliJ which compiles and executes the starter program.

To verify that the Workflow is running, visit the Web UI in your browser and click on the "Workflows" tab. You will see your Workflow listed there with a "running" status. Click on the RunID to see additional details, such as the payload that is being provided to it.

To actually execute the Workflow and Activity functions, we need to run the Worker. The Worker, once running, will immediately start polling the Task Queue for Tasks. Since we only have one Workflow with one Activity, then the Worker will pick these up in their respective order and actually execute the functions, returning the output to the Workflow starter process.

Right click on HelloWorldWorker and select Run. Another terminal will open inside of IntelliJ and you will see the Worker log each step it is taking. Since our Workflow is very simple it will finish executing the Workflow and Activity Tasks very quickly. Switch back to the starter terminal to see "Hello World!" printed to the console.

Congratulations you have successfully run a Temporal Workflow!

## Lore check

Let's see what you have learned.

**Q**: Which function type is meant to handle non-deterministic (error prone) code?

**A**: Activities are functions that are meant to handle non-deterministic code such as handling API calls.

**Q**: Which function type organizes the execution of non-deterministic code?

**A**: Workflows are functions that organize the execution of Activities, and where you can specify timeout and retry policies for them.

**Q**: What needs to be done in code to pair Activity and Workflow Tasks with a Worker?

**A**: Provide the same Task Queue name to the Activity, Workflow, and Worker. The Worker must also be registered to handle the specific Activity and Workflow.

**Q**: How can you view the details of a Workflow that has not yet completed?

**A**: One way is to open the [Temporal Web UI](localhost:8088) and click on the RunID of the Workflow.
