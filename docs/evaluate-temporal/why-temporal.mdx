# Why Temporal?

Temporal solves many problems that developers face while building distributed applications.

## Reliable execution

**How does Temporal help software developers make applications reliable?**

Temporal makes it easier for developers to build and operate reliable, scalable applications without sacrificing productivity.
The design of the system ensures that, once started, an application's main function executes to completion, whether that takes minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even years.
Temporal calls this "Durable Execution".

## Code structure

**How does Temporal simplify application code for software developers?**

By shifting the burden of failure handling from the application to the platform, there is less code for application developers to write, test, and maintain.
Temporal's programming model offers developers a way to express their business logic into coherent "Workflows" that are much easier to develop than distributed code bases.

Choose the SDK that best suits your preferred programming language and start writing your business logic. Integrate your favorite IDE, libraries, and tools into your development process.
Temporal also supports polyglot and idiomatic programming - allowing to leverage strengths of various languages or integrating into existing codebases.
All of this is achieved without developers having to manage queues or complex state machines.

## State visibility

**How does Temporal make it easy to view the state of the application?**

The Temporal provides out-of-the-box tooling that enables developers to see the state of their applications whenever they need to.
The Temporal CLI, a command-line tool, allows developers to manage, monitor, and debug Temporal applications effectively. The browser-based Web UI lets you to quickly isolate, debug, and resolve production problems.

This comprehensive visibility into the system's operations ensures that developers have all the necessary information at their fingertips to understand exactly what happened and when, greatly simplifying the troubleshooting process and enhancing overall productivity.
