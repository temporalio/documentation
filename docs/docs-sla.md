Temporal is constantly working to improve and expand its documentation. As a result, some components may change without notice. Page slugs (URLs), menu labels, and the location of information are a few of the items you can expect to see altered as we aim to try and give our users the best experience possible.

[Documentation versions](https://docs.temporal.io/versions) are used to preserve changes to user facing content, which enables older material to be referenced.

Visit [community.temporal.io](https://community.temporal.io) for help if the information you are looking for appears to be missing.

View the [source repository README](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-legacy) for contribution guidelines if you are looking to help improve the Temporal documentation experience.
