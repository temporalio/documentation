And although you've just set up a lightweight Temporal Service for development, switching your code to point at a production Temporal Service only requires changing your connection parameters.`,

    title: "Determinism",
    description: "Writing deterministic Workflows guarantees durability in the case of failure.",

Simply put, this means that each execution of a Workflow, given the same input, must follow the same path through the code and produce the same output.`,
    content2: `This means that you can’t generate a random number or interact with the outside world, as these actions are inherently non-deterministic. Generating a random number twice will likely produce different results, and if you access files, databases, or network services, you might get a failure or different results at different times.`,

Activities are called from Workflow code, and they are automatically retried if they fail. Once the Activity succeeds, the Workflow code will continue executing.",
