## Retrieve last successful result

Sometimes it is useful to obtain the progress of previous successful runs.
This is supported by two new APIs in the Go SDK:
`HasLastCompletionResult` and `GetLastCompletionResult`. Below is an example of how
to use this in Go:

```go
func CronWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) (CronResult, error) {
    startTimestamp := time.Time{} // By default start from 0 time.
    if workflow.HasLastCompletionResult(ctx) {
        var progress CronResult
        if err := workflow.GetLastCompletionResult(ctx, &progress); err == nil {
            startTimestamp = progress.LastSyncTimestamp
        }
    }
    endTimestamp := workflow.Now(ctx)

    // Process work between startTimestamp (exclusive), endTimestamp (inclusive).
    // Business logic implementation goes here.

    result := CronResult{LastSyncTimestamp: endTimestamp}
    return result, nil
}
```

Note that this works even if one of the cron schedule runs failed. The
next schedule will still get the last successful result if it ever successfully
completed at least once. For example, for a daily cron Workflow, if the first day
run succeeds and the second day fails, then the third day run will still get
the result from first day's run using these APIs.
