In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, a [Workflow Definition](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-definition) is an exportable function.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context) error {
  // ...
  return nil
}
```

In Go, by default, the Workflow Type name is the same as the function name.
