## What is a Workflow?

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, a Workflow is an exportable function.

```go
package app

import (
    "go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

func SimpleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, value string) (string, error) {
  // Do something
  if err != nil {
    return "", err
  }
  return "success", nil
}
```

The first parameter, `workflow.Context` is a requirement for all Workflow functions as it is used by the Temporal Go SDK to pass around an execution context, and virtually all the Go SDK APIs that are callable from the Workflow require it.

:::note

This `workflow.Context` entity operates similarly to the standard `context.Context` entity provided by Go.
The only difference is that the `Done()` function provided by `workflow.Context` returns `workflow.Channel` instead of the standard Go `chan`.

:::

The second parameter, `string`, is a custom parameter that can be used to pass data into the Workflow when it starts.
A Workflow can have one or more such parameters.
However, we recommend having a single parameter that is of a struct type to support backward compatibility if new parameters are added.

:::note

All Workflow function parameters must be serializable, which essentially means that params canâ€™t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers.
:::

A Workflow can return an `err` or a `value, err`.
Again, if there is a chance that the return value might change, use a struct type to hold the values.
Returning an error from a Workflow is used to indicate that an error was encountered during its execution and the Workflow should be terminated.

## How to write Workflow code

There is a single requirement for how the code inside a Workflow is written. Workflow code must be "deterministic".
This requirement stems from how the Temporal Server tracks the state of code execution and its need to be able to replay an execution.

In practical terms, this means the following:

- Workflow code can only read and manipulate local variables or variables received as return values from Temporal Go SDK APIs. For example, Workflows should never read a configuration directly as it may change in the middle of a Workflow Execution, thus breaking "determinism". Use a [SideEffect](side-effect), MutableSideEffect, or an Activity to load configuration values.
- Workflow code can not affect changes in external systems directly.
- Workflow code must use Go SDK APIs to handle things like time, logging, and goroutines.
- Workflow code can not directly iterate over maps using `range` because the order of the map's iteration is randomized.

However, the Go SDK provides a number of features to handle these restrictions with ease.

1. To interact with external systems and nondeterministic code, Workflows can execute [Activities](/docs/go/activities).
2. To handle things like time, logging, and goroutines, as mentioned above, there are specific Go SDK APIs available, such as:
   - `workflow.Now()` This is a replacement for `time.Now()`.
   - `workflow.Sleep()` This is a replacement for `time.Sleep()`.
   - `workflow.GetLogger()` This is to ensure that the provided logger does not duplicate logs during a replay.
   - `workflow.Go()` This is a replacement for the the `go` statement.
   - `workflow.Channel` This is a replacement for the native `chan` type.
     Temporal provides support for both buffered and unbuffered channels.
   - `workflow.Selector` This is a replacement for the `select` statement. Learn more on the [Go SDK Selectors](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go/selectors) page
   - `workflow.Context` This is a replacement for `context.Context`. Learn more on the [Go SDK Context Propagation](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go/tracing) page.
3. Additionally, for executing very small pieces of nondeterministic logic within the Workflow, you can use the [`workflow.SideEffect` API](/docs/go/side-effect).

Below is a sample Workflow that is treated as a cron job by the Temporal Server.
It executes a single Activity and uses `workflow.Now()`.

## How to start a Workflow

With the Go SDK, there are two ways that you can start a Workflow:

1. Use the Go SDK `client` to start a Workflow from a Go process, as described below.
2. Start a Workflow from an already running Workflow, which is known as a [Child Workflow](#child-workflow-executions).

:::note

Starting a Workflow is not the same as executing a Workflow.
Starting a Workflow means that you are telling the Server to begin tracking the state of the Workflow execution.
In a Temporal application, you do not run Workflow code directly, instead Workflow code is hosted and executed by a [Worker](/docs/go/workers).

:::

To start a Workflow you need to create the Temporal Go SDK client, call `ExecuteWorkflow()`, and pass it the following:

1. `context.Context`, which is a normal [Go `Context` type](https://golang.org/pkg/context/).
2. `client.StartWorkflowOptions` Which can include [timeout settings and a `RetryPolicy`](/docs/go/retries).
3. The name of the Workflow function.
4. Variables that should be passed to the Workflow when it begins execution.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"

    "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)

func main() {
    // Create the client object just once per process
    c, err := client.NewClient(client.Options{})
    if err != nil {
        // Handle failure
    }
    defer c.Close()

    // TaskQueue is the only required option to start a Workflow
    options := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
        TaskQueue: "your_task_queue",
    }

    we, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), options, YourWorkflow, workflowParm1, workflowParam2)
    if err != nil {
        // Handle failure
    }

    // Use the WorkflowExecution to get the result
    // Get is blocking call and will wait for the Workflow to complete
    var workflowResult string
    err = we.Get(context.Background(), &workflowResult)
    if err != nil {
        // Handle failure
    }

    // Do something with the result
    printResults(workflowResult, we.GetID(), we.GetRunID())
}
```

You can start Workflows **asynchronously** or **synchronously**.
In most use cases it is better to execute the Workflow asynchronously.
In Go, the only difference is whether the code waits for the result of the Workflow in the same process in which you started it, so you should not synchronously block the process if you don't have a good reason to.
Workflows do not rely on the process that invoked it, and will continue executing even if the waiting process crashes or stops.

:::note

In most use cases it is better to execute the Workflow asynchronously.
You can also start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule with [the CronSchedule option](distributed-cron).

:::

### Scheduling Cron Workflows

You can also start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule with the `CronSchedule` option.

```go
workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
    ID:           workflowID,
    TaskQueue:    "cron",
    CronSchedule: "* * * * *",
}

we, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, cron.SampleCronWorkflow)
```

More info in the [Distributed Cron](distributed-cron) docs.

### External Workflows

You can execute Workflows (including those from other language SDKs) by their type name:

```go
workflowID := "myworkflow_" + uuid.New()
workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
  ID:        workflowID,
  TaskQueue: "mytaskqueue",
}

we, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, "MySimpleWorkflow")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalln("Unable to execute workflow", err)
}
log.Println("Started workflow", "WorkflowID", we.GetID(), "RunID", we.GetRunID())
```

Here we execute a workflow by its type name, namely `MySimpleWorkflow`. By default, the
Workflow type is the name of the Workflow function, for example:

```go
func MySimpleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) error {
 // Workflow code here...
}
```

Note that you can also set the Workflow type via `RegisterWorkflowOptions` when registering your Workflow
with the Worker, for example:

```go
rwo := workflow.RegisterOptions {
   Name: "MyWorkflow", // Set "MyWorkflow" as the Workflow type
}
w.RegisterWorkflowWithOptions(dynamic.SampleGreetingsWorkflow, rwo)
```

Inside Workflow code you can also signal other workflows using their workflow type using `SignalExternalWorkflow`:

```go
// Send 10 signals to PHP workflow
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    err :=  workflow.SignalExternalWorkflow(ctx, "simple-workflow-php", "", "goMessage", "Hello from Go workflow: "+strconv.Itoa(i)).Get(ctx, nil)
}
```

Here we are sending a signal to a Workflow with type "simple-workflow-php" and signal name "goMessage".

See our [Signals docs](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go/signals) and [Temporal Polyglot example](https://github.com/tsurdilo/temporal-polyglot) for more.

## Child Workflows

If a Workflow Execution is started by another Workflow Execution, then it is considered a Child Workflow Execution.
The completion or failure of a Child Workflow Execution is reported to the Workflow Execution that started it (the Parent Workflow Execution).
The Parent Workflow Execution has the ability to monitor and impact the lifecycle of the Child Workflow Execution, similar to the way it does for Activities.

import WhenToUse from '../content/when-to-use-child-workflows.md'

<WhenToUse

### Parent Workflow Definition

The `workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow` call is used to schedule Workflow Executions from within an executing Workflow.
`ExecuteChildWorkflow` returns a `ChildWorkflowFuture` and you can either block on the Child Workflow starting ("asynchronous") or ending ("synchronous"):

- Block until start: `workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow(ctx, SampleChildWorkflow, "World").GetChildWorkflowExecution() `
- Block until end: `workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow(ctx, SampleChildWorkflow, "World").Get(...)`

<!--SNIPSTART samples-go-child-workflow-example-parent-workflow-definition-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

By default, a Child Workflow Execution inherits the options provided to the Parent Workflow Execution, and the Temporal Server will automatically generate a Child Workflow ID.
You can overwrite any of these options and specify a custom Child Workflow ID by customizing `ChildWorkflowOptions` and adding them to the execution context.

`ChildWorkflowOptions` include the following parameters ([API reference](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/internal#ChildWorkflowOptions)):

- Namespace
- WorkflowID
- TaskQueue
- WorkflowExecutionTimeout
- WorkflowRunTimeout
- WorkflowTaskTimeout
- WaitForCancellation
- WorkflowIDReusePolicy
- RetryPolicy
- CronSchedule
- Memo
- SearchAttributes
- ParentClosePolicy

### Child Workflow Definition

A Child Workflow is defined just like any other Workflow Definition.

<!--SNIPSTART samples-go-child-workflow-example-child-workflow-definition-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

### Querying Workflow State

When you start a Workflow with `ExecuteWorkflow`, a `WorkflowExecution` is returned (which is the `we` variable above).
The `WorkflowExecution` can be used to get the result or capture the WorkflowId.
You can retrieve the result of the Workflow **from a completely different process**, as long as you have the WorkflowId, by using `client.GetWorkflow`.

```go
we = client.GetWorkflow(workflowID)
var result string
we.Get(ctx, &result)
```

### ParentClosePolicy

When creating a Child Workflow, you can define a `ParentClosePolicy` that terminates, cancels, or abandons the Workflow Execution if the child's parent stops execution.

- `ABANDON`: When the parent stops, don't do anything with the Child Workflow.
- `TERMINATE`: When the parent stops, terminate the Child Workflow
- `REQUEST_CANCEL`: When the parent stops, terminate the Child Workflow

You can set policies per child, which means you can opt out of propagating terminates / cancels on a per-child basis.
This is useful for starting Child Workflows asynchronously:

1. Set `ChildWorkflowOptions.ParentClosePolicy` to `ABANDON` when creating a Child Workflow.
2. Start the Child Workflow Execution asynchronously using `ExecuteChildWorkflow`.
3. Call `GetChildWorkflowExecution` on the `ChildWorkflowFuture` returned by the `ChildWorkflowFuture`
4. Wait for the `ChildWorkflowFuture`.
   This indicates that the child successfully started (or start failed).
5. Complete Parent Workflow Execution asynchronously.

Steps 3 and 4 are needed to ensure that a Child Workflow Execution starts before the parent closes.
If the parent initiates a Child Workflow Execution and then immediately completes, the child would never execute.

```go
func ParentWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) error {
    childWorkflow := workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow(ctx, MyChildWorkflow)
    // Wait for child to start
    _ = childWorkflow.GetChildWorkflowExecution().Get(ctx, nil)
    return nil
}
```

## How to cancel a Workflow Execution

Use the `CancelWorkflow` API to cancel a Workflow Execution using its Id.

<!--SNIPSTART samples-go-cancellation-cancel-workflow-execution-trigger-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

### How to clean up after a Workflow is cancelled

Workflow Definitions can be written to handle execution cancellation requests with Go's `defer` and the `workflow.NewDisconnectedContext` API.
In the Workflow Definition below, there is a special Activity that handles clean up should the execution be cancelled.

## How to get data in or out of a running Workflow

[Signals](/docs/go/signals) are the mechanism by which you can get data into an already running Workflow.

[Queries](/docs/go/queries) are the mechanism by which you can get data out of a currently running Workflow.

## Custom Serialization and Workflow Security

import DataConverter from '../shared/dataconverter.md'

<DataConverter href="https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.6.0/converter#DataConverter" continueAsNewURL="#large-event-histories"/>

## Large Event Histories

import SharedContinueAsNew from '../shared/continue-as-new.md'

<SharedContinueAsNew />

To trigger this behavior, the Workflow function should
terminate by returning the special **ContinueAsNewError** error:

```go
func SimpleWorkflow(workflow.Context ctx, value string) error {
    ...
    return workflow.NewContinueAsNewError(ctx, SimpleWorkflow, value)
}
```
