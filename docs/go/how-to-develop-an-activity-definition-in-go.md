In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity Definition is an exportable function or a `struct` method.

#### Function

```go
// basic function signature
func YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context) error {
  // ...
  return nil
}

// with parameters and return values
func SimpleActivity(ctx context.Context, value string) (string, error)
```

#### Struct method

```go
type YourActivityStruct struct {
  ActivityFieldOne string
  ActivityFieldTwo int
}

func(a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context) error {
  // ...
}

func(a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinitionTwo(ctx context.Context) error {
  // ...
}
```

An "Activity struct" can have more than one method, with each method acting as a separate Activity Type.
Activities written as struct methods can use shared struct variables such as:

- an application level DB pool
- client connection to another service
- reusable utilities
- any other expensive resources you only want to initialize once per process

Because this is such a common need, the rest of this guide shows Activities written as `struct` methods.

#### Activity parameters in Go

The first parameter of an Activity Definition is `context.Context`.
This parameter is optional for an Activity Definition, though it is recommended especially if the Activity is expected to use other Go SDK APIs.

An Activity Definition can support as many other custom parameters as needed.
However, all parameters must be serializable (parameters canâ€™t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers), and it is recommended to pass a single struct that can be updated later.

```go
type YourActivityParam struct {
  ActivityParamFieldOne string
  ActivityParamFieldTwo int
}

type YourActivityStruct struct {
  // ...
}

func (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) error {
  // ...
}
```

There is no explicit limit to the amount of parameter data that can be passed to an Activity.
However, all parameters are recorded in the Workflow Execution History and a large Workflow Execution History can adversely impact the performance of your Workflow Execution.

#### Activity return values in Go

A Go-based Activity Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination (same as a Workflow Definition).
You may wish to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values, just keep in mind they must all be serializable.

```go
type YourActivityResult struct{
  ActivityResultFieldOne string
  ActivityResultFieldTwo int
}

func (a *YourActivityStruct) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (YourActivityResult, error) {
  // ...
  result := YourActivityResult {
    ActivityResultFieldOne: a.ActivityFieldOne,
    ActivityResultFieldTwo: a.ActivityFieldTwo,
  }
  return result, nil
}
```

#### Other notes for developing Activities

All native features of the Go programming language can be used within an Activity and there are no other limitations to Activity Definition logic:

- **Performance**: Keep in mind that all parameters and return values are recorded in the [Workflow Execution Event History](/docs/concepts/what-is-an-event-history).
  A large Workflow Execution Event History can adversely impact the performance of your Workflow Executions, because the entire Event History is transferred to Worker Processes with every [Workflow Task](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-task).
- **Idiomatic usage**: You are free to use:
  - your own loggers and metrics controllers
  - the standard Go concurrency constructs
  - make calls to other services across a network
