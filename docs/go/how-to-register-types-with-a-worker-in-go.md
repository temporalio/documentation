The `RegisterWorkflow()` and `RegisterActivity()` calls essentially create an in-memory mapping between the Workflow Types and their implementations, inside the Worker process.

**Registering Activity `structs`**

Per [Activity Definition](/docs/go/how-to-develop-an-activity-definition-in-go) best practices, you might have an Activity struct that has multiple methods and fields.
When you use `RegisterActivity()` for an Activity struct, that Worker has access to all exported methods.

**Registering multiple Types**

To register multiple Activity Types and/or Workflow Types with the Worker Entity, just make multiple Activity registration calls, but make sure each Type name is unique:

```go
w.registerActivity(ActivityA)
w.registerActivity(ActivityB)
w.registerActivity(ActivityC)
w.registerWorkflow(WorkflowA)
w.registerWorkflow(WorkflowB)
w.registerWorkflow(WorkflowC)
```
