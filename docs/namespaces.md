Namespaces are a logical unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform.

A Namespace is the unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform.

A single Namespace is still multi-tenant.
You can use Namespaces to match the development lifecycle; for example, having separate `dev` and `prod` Namespaces.
Or you could use them to ensure Workflow Executions between different teams never communicate; such as ensuring that the `teamA` Namespace never impacts the `teamB` Namespace.

- If no other Namespace is specified, the Temporal Cluster uses the Namespace "default" for all Temporal SDKs and tctl.
  - If you are deploying through Docker Compose or using the [auto-setup image](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-builds/blob/main/docker/auto-setup.sh) in a custom Docker Compose application, the Namespace "default" is created, through the auto-setup script.
  - If you are deploying through the [Temporal Helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts), you can create the "default" Namespace by using tctl; for example, `tctl namespace default`.
    We recommend using the default Namespace if you arenâ€™t using multiple Namespaces.
- **Case Insensitive**: Because of DNS, Namespaces are case insensitive on the network and routing side.
  We recommend using lowercase for namespace names to avoid potential issues.
- **Membership**: [Task Queue](/docs/tasks/#task-queues) names and [Workflow Ids](/docs/workflows/#workflow-id) must all correspond to a specific Namespace.
  For example, when a Workflow Execution is spawned, it does so within a specific Namespace.
- **Uniqueness**: Temporal guarantees a unique Workflow Id within a Namespace.
  Workflow Executions may have the same Workflow Id if they are in different Namespaces.
- **Namespace Configuration**: Various configuration options like the retention period and the [Archival](/docs/clusters/#archival) destination are configured per Namespace through a special CRUD API or through [`tctl`](/docs/tctl).

#### Retention Period

The Retention Period is the amount of time a Workflow Execution Event History remains in the Cluster's persistence store.

Retention Periods are per Namespace.
A Retention Period is set for the Namespace when the Namespace is created.
If the retention period isn't set, then it defaults to 2 days.
The minimum retention period is 1 day.
The maximum retention period is 30 days.
Setting the retention period to 0 results in the error _A valid retention period is not set on request_.
