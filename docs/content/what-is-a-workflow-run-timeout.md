A Workflow Run Timeout is the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run is restricted to.

**The default is set to the same value as the [Workflow Execution Timeout](/docs/content/what-is-a-workflow-execution-timeout).**
This timeout is most commonly used to limit the execution time of a single [Temporal Cron Job Execution](/docs/content/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job).

If the Workflow Run Timeout is reached, the Temporal Server automatically Terminates the Workflow Execution.
