Standard Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the sub-system and APIs that list Workflow Executions by a predefined set of filters.

Open Workflow Executions can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, or Run Id.

Closed Workflow Execution can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, Run Id, Execution Status (Completed, Failed, Timed Out, Terminated, Cancelled, or Continued-As-New).
