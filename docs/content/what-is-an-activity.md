In day-to-day conversations, the term "Activity" frequently denotes either an [Activity Type](/docs/content/what-is-an-activity-type), an [Activity Definition](/docs/content/what-is-an-activity-definition), or an [Activity Execution](/docs/content/what-is-an-activity-execution).
Temporal documentation aims to be explicit and differentiate between them.
