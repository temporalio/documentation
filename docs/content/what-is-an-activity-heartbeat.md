An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Server.
Each ping informs the Temporal Server that the Activity Execution is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.

Activity Heartbeats work in conjunction with a [Heartbeat Timeout](/docs/content/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout).

Activity Heartbeats are implemented within the Activity Definition.
Custom progress information can be included in the Heartbeat which can then be used by the Activity Execution should a retry occur.

An Activity Heartbeat can be recorded as often as needed (e.g. once a minute or every loop iteration).
Temporal SDKs control the rate in which Heartbeats are sent to the Server.

Heartbeating is not required from [Local Activites](/docs/content/what-is-a-local-activity), and does nothing.
