A Workflow Execution can be invoked using the `ExecuteWorkflow()` method on the Go SDK [`Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/client#Client), which is available via [`NewClient()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/client#NewClient) in the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/client) package.

The `ExecuteWorkflow()` API call requires an instance of [`context.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context), an instance of [`StartWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.8.0/client#StartWorkflowOptions), a Workflow Type name, and all variables to be passed to the Workflow Execution.
The `ExecuteWorkflow()` call returns a Future, which can be used to get the result of the Workflow Execution.

```go
package main

import (
  // ...

  "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)

func main() {
  c, err := client.NewClient(client.Options{})
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  defer c.Close()
  // ...
  workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
    TaskQueue: "your-task-queue",
  }
  we, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
}
```

Notice that that the Task Queue name is the same as the name provided [when a new Worker is created](#).

The only field, of the `StartWorkflowOptions` instance, that requires a value is the `TaskQueue`.
A Task Queue name is also provided to the Worker that is registered to execute that particular Workflow Type.
The Task Queue name must be the same for both.

By default, the Workflow Type name is the same as the function name.
If the invocation process has access to the function directly, then the Workflow Type name parameter can be passed as if the function name were a variable, without quotations.

If the invocation process does not have direct access to the statically defined Workflow Definition, for example, if the Workflow Definition is in an un-importable package, or it is written in a completely different language, then the Workflow Type can be provided as a `string`.

```go
we, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, "YourWorkflowDefinition", param)
```

In Go, the name of the Workflow Type can be customized when the Workflow Definition is registered with a Worker.
