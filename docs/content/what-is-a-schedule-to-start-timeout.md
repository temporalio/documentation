A Schedule-To-Start Timeout is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/docs/content/what-is-an-activity-task) is scheduled (that is, placed in a Task Queue) to when a [Worker](/docs/content/what-is-a-worker) starts (that is, picks up from the Task Queue) that Activity Task.
In other words, it's a limit for how long an Activity Task can be enqueued.
The moment that the Task is picked by the Worker from the task queue is considered to be the start of the Activity Task for the Schedule To Start timeout and associated metrics to avoid clock difference between the Server and the Worker.

"Schedule" in Schedule-To-Start and Schedule-To-Close both refer to the scheduling of an Activity Task.
Schedule-To-Close refers to the scheduling of the *first* Activity Task in the set of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution.
"Schedule" in Schedule-To-Start refers to the scheduling of *any* Activity Task in the set of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution.
In other words, Schedule-To-Close Timeout is enforced once per Activity Execution, whereas Schedule-To-Start Timeout is enforced for each Activity Task.
This is because a [Retry Policy](/docs/content/what-is-a-retry-policy) attached to an Activity Execution retries an Activity Task.
Thus, the Schedule-To-Start Timeout and latency metrics are applied to each Activity Task separately within an Activity Execution.

This timeout has two primary use cases:

1. Detect whether an individual Worker has crashed.
2. Detect whether the fleet of Workers polling the Task Queue is not able to keep up with the rate of Activity Tasks.

**The default Schedule-To-Start Timeout is âˆž (infinity).**

If this timeout is used, we recommend setting this timeout to the maximum time a Workflow Execution is willing to wait for an Activity Execution in the presence of all possible Worker outages, and have a concrete plan in place to reroute Activity Tasks to a different Task Queue.
This timeout **does not** trigger any retries regardless of the Retry Policy, as a retry would place the Activity Task back into the same Task Queue.
We do not recommend using this timeout unless you know what you are doing.

In most cases, we recommend monitoring the `temporal_activity_schedule_to_start_latency` metric to know when Workers slow down picking up Activity Tasks, instead of setting this timeout.
