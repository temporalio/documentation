A Schedule To Start Timeout is the maximum amount of time that is allowed, from when an [Activity Task](/docs/content/what-is-an-activity-task) is scheduled (placed in a Task Queue) to when a [Worker](/docs/content/what-is-a-worker) starts executing that Activity Task.

There are two primary uses case of this timeout:

1. Detect whether an individual Worker has crashed.
2. Detect whether the fleet of Workers polling the Task Queue is not able to keep up with the rate of Activity Tasks.

**The default Schedule-To-Start Timeout is âˆž (infinity).**

If this timeout is used, we recommend setting this timeout to the maximum time a Workflow Execution is willing to wait for an Activity Execution in the presence of all possible Worker outages, and have a concrete plan in place to reroute Activity Tasks to a different Task Queue.
This timeout **does not** trigger any retries regardless of the Retry Policy, as a retry would place the Activity Task back into the same Task Queue.
As a reminder, we do not recommend using this timeout unless you know what you are doing.

In most cases, we recommend monitoring the `temporal_activity_schedule_to_start_latency` metric to know when Workers are not picking up Activity Tasks, instead of setting this timeout.
