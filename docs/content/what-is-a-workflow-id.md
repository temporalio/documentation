A Workflow Id is a customizable, application-level identifier for a [Workflow Execution](/docs/content/what-is-a-workflow-execution) that is unique to an Open Workflow Execution within a [Namespace](/docs/server/namespaces).

A Workflow Id is often a business-level customer ID or order ID.

A [Workflow Id Reuse Policy](/docs/content/what-is-a-workflow-id-reuse-policy) can be used to manage whether a Workflow Id can be re-used.
