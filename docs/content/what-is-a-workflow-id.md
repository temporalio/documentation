A Workflow Id is a unique identifier for a [Workflow Execution](#).

- Temporal guarantees the uniqueness of a Workflow Id within a [Namespace](docs/server/namespaces). A Workflow is uniquely identified by its [Namespace](docs/server/namespaces), Workflow Id, and [Run Id](what-is-a-run-id).
- An attempt to start a [Workflow](#) with a duplicate Workflow Id results in an **already started** error if another open Workflow Execution has the same Workflow Id. However, this behavior depends on the `WorkflowIdReusePolicy` flag; if set to `ALLOW_DUPLICATE`, it is possible to start a new execution with the same Workflow Id.
- You can assign a custom Workflow Id to a [Workflow](#). Use a custom Workflow Id for business-level identification, such as a customer ID or an order ID.
