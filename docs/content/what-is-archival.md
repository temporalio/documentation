Archival is a feature that automatically backs up [Event Histories](/docs/content/what-is-an-event-history) from Temporal Cluster persistence to a custom blob store after the Closed [Workflow Execution](/docs/content/what-is-a-workflow-execution) retention period is reached.

The purpose of Archival is to keep [Event Histories](#event-history) as long as needed while not overwhelming the persistence store.

You might want to keep [Event Histories](#event-history) after the retention period has passed for two reasons:

- Compliance: For legal reasons, [Event Histories](#event-history) may need to be stored for a long period of time.

- Debugging: Older [Event Histories](#event-history) can be referenced to help with debugging.
