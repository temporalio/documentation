In day-to-day conversations, the term "Workflow" frequently denotes either a [Workflow Type](/docs/content/what-is-a-workflow-type), a [Workflow Definition](/docs/content/what-is-a-workflow-definition), or a [Workflow Execution](/docs/content/what-is-a-workflow-execution).
  Temporal documentation aims to be explicit and differentiate between them.
