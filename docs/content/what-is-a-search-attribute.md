A Search Attribute is an indexed field used in a <preview page={WhatIsAListFilter}>List Filter</preview> to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.

:::note

If a Temporal Cluster does not have Elasticsearch integrated, but a Workflow Execution is spawned and tagged with Search Attributes, no errors occur.
However, you won't be able to use Advanced Visibility List APIs and List Filters to find and list the Workflow Execution.

<!--TODO Link to What is Continue-As-New-->

When using Continue-As-New or a <preview page={WhatIsATemporalCronJob}>Temporal Cron Job</preview>, Search Attributes are carried over to the new Run by default.

### Default Search Attributes

A Temporal Cluster that is integrated with Elasticsearch has a set of default Search Attributes already available.
These Search Attributes are created when the initial index is created.

| NAME                  | TYPE     |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| BatcherNamespace      | Keyword  |
| BatcherUser           | Keyword  |
| BinaryChecksums       | Keyword  |
| CloseTime             | Datetime |
| ExecutionDuration     | Int      |
| ExecutionStatus       | Keyword  |
| ExecutionTime         | Datetime |
| HistoryLength         | Int      |
| RunId                 | Keyword  |
| StartTime             | Datetime |
| StateTransitionCount  | Int      |
| TaskQueue             | Keyword  |
| TemporalChangeVersion | Keyword  |
| WorkflowId            | Keyword  |
| WorkflowType          | Keyword  |

- All default Search Attributes are reserved and read-only.
  (You cannot create a custom one with the same name or alter the existing one.)

- ExecutionStatus values correspond to Workflow Execution Statuses: Running, Completed, Failed, Canceled, Terminated, ContinuedAsNew, TimedOut.

- StartTime, CloseTime, and ExecutionTime are stored as dates but are supported by queries that use either EpochTime in nanoseconds or a string in [RFC3339Nano format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants) (such as "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00").

- ExecutionDuration is stored in nanoseconds but is supported by queries that use integers in nanoseconds, [Golang duration format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration), or "hh:mm:ss" format.

- CloseTime, HistoryLength, StateTransitionCount, and ExecutionDuration are present only in a Closed Workflow Execution.

- ExecutionTime can differ from StartTime in retry and cron use cases.

### Custom Search Attributes

Custom Search Attributes can be <preview page={HowToAddCustomSearchAttribute}>added to a Temporal Cluster only by using `tctl`</preview>.
Adding a Search Attribute makes it available to use with Workflow Executions within that Cluster.

There is no hard limit on the number of attributes you can add.
However, we recommend enforcing the following limits:

- Number of Search Attributes: 100 per Workflow
- Size of each value: 2 KB per value
- Total size of names and values: 40 KB per Workflow

:::note

Due to Elasticsearch limitations, you can only add Search Attributes.
It is not possible to rename Search Attributes or remove them from the index schema.

:::

Search Attributes must be one of the following types:

- Text
- Keyword
- Int
- Double
- Bool
- Datetime

The [temporalio/auto-setup](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/auto-setup) Docker image uses a pre-defined set of custom Search Attributes that are handy for testing.
Their names indicate their types:

- CustomTextField
- CustomKeywordField
- CustomIntField
- CustomDoubleField
- CustomBoolField
- CustomDatetimeField

Note:

- **Double** is backed up by `scaled_float` Elasticsearch type with scale factor 10000 (4 decimal digits).
- **Datetime** is backed up by `date` type with milliseconds precision in Elasticsearch 6 and `date_nanos` type with nanoseconds precision in Elasticsearch 7.
- **Int** is 64-bit integer (`long` Elasticsearch type).
- **Keyword** and **Text** types are concepts taken from Elasticsearch. Each word in a **Text** is considered a searchable keyword.
  For a UUID, that can be problematic because Elasticsearch indexes each portion of the UUID separately.
  To have the whole string considered as a searchable keyword, use the **Keyword** type.
  For example, if the key `ProductId` has the value of `2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`:
  - As a **Keyword** it would be matched only by `ProductId = "2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`.
  - As a **Text** it would be matched by `ProductId = 2dd8`, which could cause unwanted matches.
- The **Text** type cannot be used in the "Order By" clause.

### Search Attributes as Workflow Execution metadata

To actually have results from the use of a <preview page={WhatIsAListFilter}>List Filter</preview>, Search Attributes must be added to a Workflow Execution as metadata.
How to do this entirely depends on the method by which you spawn the Workflow Execution:
