A Task Queue is a first-in, first-out queue that a <preview page={WhatIsAWorker}>Worker</preview> polls for <preview page={WhatIsATask}>Tasks</preview>.

Each Task Queue is capable of queuing both <preview page={WhatIsAnActivityTask}>Activity Tasks</preview> and <preview page={WhatIsAWorkflowTask}>Workflow Tasks</preview>.

Task Queues are very lightweight components.

- Task Queues do not require explicit registration but instead are created on demand when a Workflow Execution or Activity spawns or when a Worker Process subscribes to it.
- There is no limit to the number of Task Queues a Temporal Application can use or a Temporal Cluster can maintain.

Workers poll for Tasks in Task Queues via synchronous RPC.
This implementation offers several benefits:

- Worker Processes do not need to have any open ports, which is more secure.
- Worker Processes do not need to advertise themselves through DNS or any other network discovery mechanism.
- When all Worker Processes are down, messages simply persist in a Task Queue, waiting for the Worker Processes to recover.
- A Worker Processes polls for a message only when it has spare capacity, avoiding overloading itself.
- In effect, Task Queues enable load balancing across a large number of Worker Processes.
- Task Queues support server-side throttling, which enables you to limit the Task dispatching rate to the pool of Worker Processes while still supporting Task dispatching at higher rates when spikes happen.
- Task Queues enable what we call <preview page={WhatIsTaskRouting}>Task Routing</preview>, which is the routing of specific Tasks to specific Worker Processes or even a specific process.

All Workers listening to a given Task Queue must have identical registrations of Activities and/or Workflows.
The one exception is during a Server upgrade, where it is okay to have registration temporarily misaligned while the binary rolls out.
