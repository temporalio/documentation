Advanced Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that enable the listing, filtering, and sorting of Workflow Executions via a custom SQL-like <preview page={WhatIsAListFilter}>List Filter</preview>.

To use Advanced Visibility, your Temporal Cluster must be <preview page={HowToIntegrateElasticsearch}>integrated with Elasticsearch</preview>.
We highly recommend operating a Temporal Cluster with Elasticsearch for any use case that spawns more than just a few Workflow Executions.
Elasticsearch takes on the Visibility request load, relieving potential performance issues.
