A Task is the context needed to make progress with a specific [Workflow Execution](/docs/content/what-is-a-workflow-execution) or [Activity Execution](/docs/content/what-is-an-activity-execution).

There are two types of Tasks:

- [Activity Task](/docs/content/what-is-an-activity-task)
- [Workflow Task](/docs/content/what-is-a-workflow-task)

A single Activity Execution corresponds to a single Activity Task, while a Workflow Execution may have many Workflow Tasks.
