The context needed to execute a specific [Activity](#activity) or [Workflow](#workflow) state transition.

- There are two types of tasks:
  - [Activity Task](#activity-task)
  - [Workflow Task](#workflow-task)
- A single [Activity](#activity) execution corresponds to a single [Activity Task](#activity-task), while a [Workflow Execution](#workflow-execution) employs multiple [Workflow Tasks](#workflow-task).
