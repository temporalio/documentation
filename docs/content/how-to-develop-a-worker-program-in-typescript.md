title: How to develop a Worker Program in TypeScript
description: Import a Worker from the `@temporalio/worker` module and call `Worker.create()` to create a new Worker in TypeScript.

First create a Worker with `Worker.create()` (which establishes the initial gRPC connection), then call `worker.run()` on it (to start polling the Task Queue).

Below is an example of starting a Worker that polls the Task Queue named `tutorial`.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-hello-worker {"enable_source_link": false}-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

`taskQueue` is the only required option, but you will also use `workflowsPath` and `activities` to register Workflows and Activities with the Worker.
See below for more Worker options.

### Workflow and Activity registration

Workers bundle Workflow code and `node_modules` using Webpack v5 and execute them inside V8 isolates.
Activities are directly required and run by Workers in the Node.js environment.

Workers are very flexible - you can host any or all of your Workflows and Activities on a Worker, and you can host multiple Workers in a single machine.

There are three main things the Worker needs:

- `taskQueue`: the Task Queue to poll. This is the only required argument.
- `activities`: Optional. Imported and supplied directly to the Worker. Not file path name.
- Workflow bundle:
  - Either specify a `workflowsPath` to your `workflows.ts` file to pass to Webpack, e.g. `require.resolve('./workflows')`. Workflows will be bundled with their dependencies, which you can finetune with `nodeModulesPaths`.
  - Or pass a prebuilt bundle to `workflowBundle` instead if you prefer to handle the bundling yourself.

### Additional Worker Options

This is a selected subset of options you are likely to use. Even more advanced options, particularly for performance tuning, are available in [the API reference](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions).

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nodeModulesPaths` | Array of paths of Workflow dependencies to pass to Webpack. Defaults to the first encountered `node_modules` directory when scanning the filesystem starting with `workflowsPath`. |
| `dataConverter`    | placeholder for future DataConverter feature (pending feature)                                                                                                                     |
| `sinks`            | Allows injection of Workflow Sinks (Advanced feature: see [Logging docs](/docs/typescript/logging))                                                                                |
| `interceptors`     | A mapping of interceptor type to a list of factories or module paths (Advanced feature: see [Interceptors](/docs/typescript/interceptors))                                         |
