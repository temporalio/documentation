A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an <preview page={WhatIsAdvancedVisibility}>Advanced Visibility</preview> List API.

The following is an example List Filter:

```
WorkflowType = "main.YourWorkflowDefinition" and ExecutionStatus != "Running" and (StartTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or CloseTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34-08:00") order by StartTime desc
```

[More example List Filters](#example-list-filters)

A List Filter contains Search Attribute keys, Search Attribute values, and Operators.

- The following operators are supported in List Filters:

  - **AND, OR, ()**
  - **=, !=, >, >=, <, <=**
  - **IN**
  - **BETWEEN ... AND**
  - **ORDER BY**

- A List Filter applies to a single Namespace.

- The range of a List Filter timestamp (StartTime, CloseTime, ExecutionTime) cannot exceed 9223372036854775807 (that is, maxInt64 - 1001).

- A List Filter that uses a time range has a resolution of 1 ms on Elasticsearch 6 and 1 ns on Elasticsearch 7.

- List Filter Search Attribute key names are case sensitive.

- An Advanced List Filter API may take longer than expected if it is retrieving a large number of Workflow Executions (more than 10 million).

- A `ListWorkflow` API supports pagination.
  Use the page token in the following call to retrieve the next page; continue until the page token is `null`/`nil`.

- To paginate through a large number of Workflow Executions without skipping or duplicating them, use the `ScanWorkflow` API.

- To efficiently count the number of Workflow Executions, use the `CountWorkflow` API.

### Example List Filters

```sql
WorkflowId = 'wid'`
```

```sql
`WorkflowId = 'wid' or WorkflowId = 'another-wid'`
```

```sql
`WorkflowId = 'wid' order by StartTime desc`
```

```sql
`WorkflowId = 'wid' and CloseTime = missing`
```

```sql
`WorkflowId = 'wid' or CloseTime = missing`
```

```sql
`CloseTime = missing order by CloseTime desc`
```

```sql
`WorkflowId = 'wid' and StartTime > "2018-06-07T15:04:05+00:00"`
```

```sql
ExecutionTime between 1 and 2`
```

```sql
`ExecutionTime < 1000000 or ExecutionTime > 2000000`
```

```sql
`order by ExecutionTime`
```

```sql
`order by StartTime desc, CloseTime asc`
```

```sql
`order by CustomStringField desc`
```

```sql
`order by CustomIntField asc`
```

```sql
`ExecutionTime < "unable to parse"`
```

```sql
`WorkflowId = 'wid' union select * from dummy`
```
