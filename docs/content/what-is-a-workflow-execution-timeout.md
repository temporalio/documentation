This is the maximum time that a Workflow Execution can be executing (have an Open status) including retries and any usage of Continue As New.

**The default value is 10 years.**

If this timeout is reached then the Workflow Execution will change to a Timed Out status.

This timeout is different from the [Workflow Run timeout](/docs/content/what-is-a-workflow-run-timeout).

This timeout is most commonly used for stopping the execution of a cron scheduled Workflow after a certain amount of time has passed.
