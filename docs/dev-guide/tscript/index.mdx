This guide is meant to provide a comprehensive overview of the structures, primitives, and features used in [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application) development.

## Project-setup

The project setup section of the Temporal TypeScript SDK Developer's guide covers the minimum set of concepts and implementation details needed to build and run a Temporal Application in TypeScript—that is, all the relevant steps to start a Workflow Execution that executes an Activity.

- [Install the Temporal CLI](/dev-guide/typescript/project-setup#install-cli): Download and install the Temporal CLI for Mac, Linux, or Windows.
- [Choose a development Cluster](/dev-guide/typescript/project-setup#choose-dev-cluster): Discover which development Cluster you should choose
- [Boilerplate Temporal Application project code](/dev-guide/typescript/project-setup#boilerplate-project): Discover the minimum code you need to create a boilerplate Temporal Application with TypeScript

- [Add a testing framework](/dev-guide/typescript/project-setup#test-framework): How to add a testing framework to your Temporal Application.
- [Conclusion](/dev-guide/typescript/project-setup#conclusion): Wrap up and review of concepts

## Durable-execution

The Durable Execution section of the Temporal Developer's guide covers advanced beginner concepts for working with Temporal, including testing your code, reviewing workflow event history, adding timers, and understanding determinism. Developing for durable execution is a core aspect of Temporal.

- [Retrieve a Workflow Execution's Event History](/dev-guide/typescript/durable-execution#retrieve-event-history): Learn how to retrieve your Workflow Execution's Event History

- [Non-deterministic code changes](/dev-guide/typescript/durable-execution#durability-through-replays): History Replay, sometimes also called Workflow Replay, is the mechanism that Temporal uses to reconstruct the state of a Workflow Execution. Temporal provides Durable Execution via this Replay Functionality.

## Foundations

The Foundations section of the Temporal Developer's guide covers the minimum set of concepts and implementation details needed to build and run a Temporal Application – that is, all the relevant steps to start a Workflow Execution that executes an Activity.

- [How to start a Workflow Execution](/dev-guide/typescript/foundations#start-workflow-execution): Workflow Execution semantics rely on several parameters—that is, to start a Workflow Execution you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type, language-specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.
- [Cancellation scopes in Typescript](/dev-guide/typescript/foundations#cancellation-scopes):

## Features

The Features section of the Temporal Developer's guide provides basic implementation guidance on how to use many of the development features available to Workflows and Activities in the Temporal Platform.

- [How to develop with Signals](/dev-guide/typescript/messages#signals): A Signal is a message sent to a running Workflow Execution.
- [How to develop with Queries](/dev-guide/typescript/messages#queries): A Query is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.
- [How to define Signals and Queries statically or dynamically](/dev-guide/typescript/messages#static-and-dynamic-signals-and-queries): Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.
- [Workflow timeouts](/dev-guide/typescript/features#workflow-timeouts): Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.
- [How to set Activity timeouts](/dev-guide/typescript/features#activity-timeouts): Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.
- [How to Heartbeat an Activity](/dev-guide/typescript/features#activity-heartbeats): An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster.
- [How to asynchronously complete an Activity](/dev-guide/typescript/features#asynchronous-activity-completion): Asynchronous Activity Completion enables the Activity Function to return without the Activity Execution completing.
- [Local Activities](/dev-guide/typescript/features#local-activities): To call Local Activities in TypeScript, use proxyLocalActivities.
- [Cancel an Activity from a Workflow](/dev-guide/typescript/features#cancel-an-activity): An Activity can be canceled from within a Workflow if the Activity sends Heartbeats.
