## Signals

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#signal">Signal<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Signal?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Signal is an asynchronous request to a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#signal">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a message sent to a running Workflow Execution.

Signals are defined in your code and handled in your Workflow Definition.
Signals can be sent to Workflow Executions from a Temporal Client or from another Workflow Execution.

### Define Signal

A Signal has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Signal type, is a string.
- The arguments must be <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#">serializable<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

[`defineSignal`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#definesignal)

```ts
import { defineSignal } from '@temporalio/workflow';

interface JoinInput {
  userId: string;
  groupId: string;
}

export const joinSignal = defineSignal<[JoinInput]>('join');
```

### Handle Signal

Workflows listen for Signals by the Signal's name.

[`setHandler`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#sethandler)

```ts
import { setHandler } from '@temporalio/workflow';

export async function yourWorkflow() {
  const groups = new Map<string, Set<string>>();

  setHandler(joinSignal, ({ userId, groupId }: JoinInput) => {
    const group = groups.get(groupId);
    if (group) {
      group.add(userId);
    } else {
      groups.set(groupId, new Set([userId]));
    }
  });
}
```

### Send Signal from Client

When a Signal is sent successfully from the Temporal Client, the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.

[`WorkflowHandle.signal`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowHandle#signal)

```typescript
import { WorkflowClient } from '@temporalio/client';
import { joinSignal } from './workflows';

const client = new WorkflowClient();

const handle = client.getHandle('workflow-id-123');

await handle.signal(joinSignal, { userId: 'user-1', groupId: 'group-1' });
```

### Send Signal from Workflow

A Workflow can send a Signal to another Workflow, in which case it's called an _External Signal_.

When an External Signal is sent:

- A [SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated) Event appears in the sender's Event History.
- A [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the recipient's Event History.

[`getExternalWorkflowHandle`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#getexternalworkflowhandle)

```typescript
import { getExternalWorkflowHandle } from '@temporalio/workflow';
import { joinSignal } from './other-workflow';

export async function yourWorkflowThatSignals() {
  const handle = getExternalWorkflowHandle('workflow-id-123');
  await handle.signal(joinSignal, { userId: 'user-1', groupId: 'group-1' });
}
```

### Signal-With-Start

Signal-With-Start is used from the Client.
It takes a Workflow Id, Workflow arguments, a Signal name, and Signal arguments.

If there's a Workflow running with the given Workflow Id, it will be signaled. If there isn't, a new Workflow will be started and immediately signaled.

[`WorkflowClient.signalWithStart`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.WorkflowClient#signalwithstart)

```typescript
import { WorkflowClient } from '@temporalio/client';
import { joinSignal, yourWorkflow } from './workflows';

const client = new WorkflowClient();

await client.signalWithStart(yourWorkflow, {
  workflowId: 'workflow-id-123',
  args: [{ foo: 1 }],
  signal: joinSignal,
  signalArgs: [{ userId: 'user-1', groupId: 'group-1' }],
});
```

## Queries

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#query">Query<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Query?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Query is a synchronous operation that is used to report the state of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#query">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.

### Define Query

A Query has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Query type, is a string.
- The arguments must be <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#">serializable<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Use [`defineQuery`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#definequery) to define the name, parameters, and return value of a Query.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-define-query -->

[state/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/state/src/workflows.ts)

```ts
import { defineQuery } from '@temporalio/workflow';

export const getValueQuery = defineQuery<number | undefined, [string]>(
  'getValue',
);
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

### Handle Query

Queries are handled by your Workflow.

Donâ€™t include any logic that causes <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#command">Command<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Command?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Command is a requested action issued by a Worker to the Temporal Cluster after a Workflow Task Execution completes.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#command">Learn more</a></span></span></a> generation within a Query handler (such as executing Activities).
Including such logic causes unexpected behavior.

Use [`handleQuery`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.WorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor/#handlequery) to handle Queries inside a Workflow.

You make a Query with `handle.query(query, ...args)`. A Query needs a return value, but can also take arguments.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-handle-query -->

[state/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/state/src/workflows.ts)

```ts
export async function trackState(): Promise<void> {
  const state = new Map<string, number>();
  setHandler(setValueSignal, (key, value) => void state.set(key, value));
  setHandler(getValueQuery, (key) => state.get(key));
  await CancellationScope.current().cancelRequested;
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

### Send Query

Queries are sent from a Temporal Client.

Use [`WorkflowHandle.query`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowHandle/#query) to query a running or completed Workflow.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-send-query -->

[state/src/query-workflow.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/state/src/query-workflow.ts)

```ts
import { Client } from '@temporalio/client';
import { getValueQuery } from './workflows';

async function run(): Promise<void> {
  const client = new Client();
  const handle = client.workflow.getHandle('state-id-0');
  const meaning = await handle.query(getValueQuery, 'meaning-of-life');
  console.log({ meaning });
}
```

## Workflow timeouts

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when <a class="tdlp" href="#workflow-timeouts">starting the Workflow Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">Workflow timeouts</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#workflow-timeouts">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- **<a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-execution-timeout">Workflow Execution Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Execution Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Execution Timeout is the maximum time that a Workflow Execution can be executing (have an Open status) including retries and any usage of Continue As New.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-execution-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.

Create an instance of `WorkflowOptions` from the Client and set your Workflow Timeout.

Available timeouts are:

- [`workflowExecutionTimeoutâ€‹`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowOptions/#workflowexecutiontimeout)
- [`workflowRunTimeout`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowOptions/#workflowruntimeout)

### Workflow retries

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#">Retry Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

Create an instance of the Retry Policy, known as [`retry`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowOptions/#retry) in TypeScript, from the [`WorkflowOptions`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/client.WorkflowOptions) of the Client interface.

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-retry-workflow -->

  retry: {
    maximumAttempts: 3,
  },
});
```

## Activity timeouts

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **<a class="tdlp" href="/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout">Schedule-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule-To-Close Timeout is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall Activity Execution, from when the first Activity Task is scheduled to when the last Activity Task, in the chain of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution, reaches a Closed status.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>**: is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

When you call `proxyActivities` in a Workflow Function, you can set a range of `ActivityOptions`.

Available timeouts are:

- [`scheduleToCloseTimeout`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.ActivityOptions/#scheduletoclosetimeout)
- [`startToCloseTimeout`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.ActivityOptions/#starttoclosetimeout)
- [`scheduleToStartTimeout`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.ActivityOptions/#scheduletostarttimeout)

```typescript
// Sample of typical options you can set
const { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  scheduleToCloseTimeout: '5m',
  // startToCloseTimeout: "30s", // recommended
  // scheduleToStartTimeout: "60s",

  retry: {
    // default retry policy if not specified
    initialInterval: '1s',
    backoffCoefficient: 2,
    maximumAttempts: Infinity,
    maximumInterval: 100 * initialInterval,
    nonRetryableErrorTypes: [],
  },
});
```

### Activity retries

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#">Retry Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> if a custom one is not provided.

To set Activity Retry Policies in TypeScript, pass [`ActivityOptions.retry`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.ActivityOptions#retry) to [`proxyActivities`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#proxyactivities).

```typescript
// Sample of typical options you can set
const { yourActivity } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  // ...
  retry: {
    // default retry policy if not specified
    initialInterval: '1s',
    backoffCoefficient: 2,
    maximumAttempts: Infinity,
    maximumInterval: 100 * initialInterval,
    nonRetryableErrorTypes: [],
  },
});
```

### Activity retry simulator

Use this tool to visualize total Activity Execution times and experiment with different Activity timeouts and Retry Policies.

The simulator is based on a common Activity use-case, which is to call a third party HTTP API and return the results.
See the example code snippets below.

Use the Activity Retries settings to configure how long the API request takes to succeed or fail.
There is an option to generate scenarios.
The _Task Time in Queue_ simulates the time the Activity Task might be waiting in the Task Queue.

Use the Activity Timeouts and Retry Policy settings to see how they impact the success or failure of an Activity Execution.

Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Cluster that the <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Clusterâ€”they may be <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#throttling">throttled<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Heartbeat?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Cluster when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Cluster.

Long-running Activities should Heartbeat their progress back to the Workflow for earlier detection of stalled Activities (with <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Heartbeat Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Heartbeat Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Heartbeat Timeout is the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>) and resuming stalled Activities from checkpoints (with Heartbeat details).

To set Activity Heartbeat, use `Context.current().heartbeat()` in your Activity implementation, and set `heartbeatTimeout` in your Workflow.

```ts
// activity implementation
export async function example(sleepIntervalMs = 1000): Promise<void> {
  for (let progress = 1; progress <= 1000; ++progress) {
    await Context.current().sleep(sleepIntervalMs);
    // record activity heartbeat
    Context.current().heartbeat();
  }
}

// ...

// workflow code calling activity
const { example } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '1 hour',
  heartbeatTimeout: '10s',
});
```

In the previous example, setting the Heartbeat informs the Temporal Server of the Activity's progress at regular intervals.
If the Activity stalls or the Activity Worker becomes unavailable, the absence of Heartbeats prompts the Temporal Server to retry the Activity immediately, without waiting for `startToCloseTimeout` to complete.

You can also add `heartbeatDetails` as a checkpoint to collect data about failures during the execution, and use it to resume the Activity from that point.

The following example extends the previous sample to include a `heartbeatDetails` checkpoint.

```ts
export async function example(sleepIntervalMs = 1000): Promise<void> {
  const startingPoint = Context.current().info.heartbeatDetails || 1; // allow for resuming from heartbeat
  for (let progress = startingPoint; progress <= 100; ++progress) {
    await Context.current().sleep(sleepIntervalMs);
    Context.current().heartbeat(progress);
  }
}
```

In this example, when the `heartbeatTimeout` is reached and the Activity is retried, the Activity Worker picks up the execution from where the previous attempt left off.

#### Heartbeat Timeout

To set a Heartbeat Timeout, use [`ActivityOptions.heartbeatTimeout`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/common.ActivityOptions#heartbeattimeout). If the Activity takes longer than that between heartbeats, the Activity is failed.

```typescript
// Creating a proxy for the activity.
const { longRunningActivity } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  // translates to 300000 ms
  scheduleToCloseTimeout: '5m',
  // translates to 30000 ms
  startToCloseTimeout: '30s',
  // equivalent to '10 seconds'
  heartbeatTimeout: 10000,
});
```

## Asynchronous Activity Completion

<a class="tdlp" href="/activities#asynchronous-activity-completion">Asynchronous Activity Completion<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Asynchronous Activity Completion?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Asynchronous Activity Completion occurs when an external system provides the final result of a computation, started by an Activity, to the Temporal System.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#asynchronous-activity-completion">Learn more</a></span></span></a> enables the Activity Function to return without the Activity Execution completing.

There are three steps to follow:

1. The Activity provides the external system with identifying information needed to complete the Activity Execution.
   Identifying information can be a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#task-token">Task Token<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Task Token?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Task Token is a unique Id that correlates to an Activity Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#task-token">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, or a combination of Namespace, Workflow Id, and Activity Id.
2. The Activity Function completes in a way that identifies it as waiting to be completed by an external system.
3. The Temporal Client is used to Heartbeat and complete the Activity.

To asynchronously complete an Activity, call [`AsyncCompletionClient.complete`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.AsyncCompletionClient#complete).

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-activity-complete-async -->

[activities-examples/src/activities/async-completion.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/activities-examples/src/activities/async-completion.ts)

import { CompleteAsyncError, Context } from '@temporalio/activity';
import { AsyncCompletionClient } from '@temporalio/client';

export async function doSomethingAsync(): Promise<string> {
  const taskToken = Context.current().info.taskToken;
  setTimeout(() => doSomeWork(taskToken), 1000);
  throw new CompleteAsyncError();
}

// this work could be done in a different process or on a different machine
async function doSomeWork(taskToken: Uint8Array): Promise<void> {
  const client = new AsyncCompletionClient();
  // does some work...
  await client.complete(taskToken, 'Job\'s done!');
}
```

## Cancel an Activity

Canceling an Activity from within a Workflow requires that the Activity Execution sends Heartbeats and sets a Heartbeat Timeout.
If the Heartbeat is not invoked, the Activity cannot receive a cancellation request.
When any non-immediate Activity is executed, the Activity Execution should send Heartbeats and set a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Heartbeat Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Heartbeat Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Heartbeat Timeout is the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to ensure that the server knows it is still working.

When an Activity is canceled, an error is raised in the Activity at the next available opportunity.
If cleanup logic needs to be performed, it can be done in a `finally` clause or inside a caught cancel error.
However, for the Activity to appear canceled the exception needs to be re-raised.

:::note

Unlike regular Activities, <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#local-activity">Local Activities<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Local Activity?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Local Activity is an Activity Execution that executes in the same process as the Workflow Execution that spawns it.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#local-activity">Learn more</a></span></span></a> can be canceled if they don't send Heartbeats.
Local Activities are handled locally, and all the information needed to handle the cancellation logic is available in the same Worker process.

## Child Workflows

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#child-workflow">Child Workflow Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Child Workflow Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Child Workflow Execution is a Workflow Execution that is spawned from within another Workflow.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#child-workflow">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a Workflow Execution that is scheduled from within another Workflow using a Child Workflow API.

When using a Child Workflow API, Child Workflow related Events ([StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#startchildworkflowexecutioninitiated), [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted), [ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutioncompleted), etc...) are logged in the Workflow Execution Event History.

Always block progress until the [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted) Event is logged to the Event History to ensure the Child Workflow Execution has started.
After that, Child Workflow Executions may be abandoned using the default _Abandon_ <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Parent Close Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Parent Close Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">If a Workflow Execution is a Child Workflow Execution, a Parent Close Policy determines what happens to the Workflow Execution if its Parent Workflow Execution changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, Timed out).</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Learn more</a></span></span></a> set in the Child Workflow Options.

To be sure that the Child Workflow Execution has started, first call the Child Workflow Execution method on the instance of Child Workflow future, which returns a different future.

Then get the value of an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, which is what waits until the Child Workflow Execution has spawned.

To start a Child Workflow and return a [handle](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/workflow.ChildWorkflowHandle/) to it, use [`startChild`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#startchild).

To start a Child Workflow Execution and await its completion, use [`executeChild`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow/#executechild).

By default, a child is scheduled on the same Task Queue as the parent.

## Schedule a Workflow

Scheduling Workflows is a crucial aspect of any automation process, especially when dealing with time-sensitive tasks. By scheduling a Workflow, you can automate repetitive tasks, reduce the need for manual intervention, and ensure timely execution of your business processes

Use any of the following action to help Schedule a Workflow Execution and take control over your automation process.

### Create

The create action enables you to create a new Schedule. When you create a new Schedule, a unique Schedule ID is generated, which you can use to reference the Schedule in other Schedule commands.

### Backfill

The backfill action executes Actions ahead of their specified time range. This command is useful when you need to execute a missed or delayed Action, or when you want to test the Workflow before its scheduled time.

### Delete

The delete action enables you to delete a Schedule. When you delete a Schedule, it does not affect any Workflows that were started by the Schedule.

### Describe

The describe action shows the current Schedule configuration, including information about past, current, and future Workflow Runs. This command is helpful when you want to get a detailed view of the Schedule and its associated Workflow Runs.

### List

The list action lists all the available Schedules. This command is useful when you want to view a list of all the Schedules and their respective Schedule IDs.

### Pause

The pause action enables you to pause and unpause a Schedule. When you pause a Schedule, all the future Workflow Runs associated with the Schedule are temporarily stopped. This command is useful when you want to temporarily halt a Workflow due to maintenance or any other reason.

### Trigger

The trigger action triggers an immediate action with a given Schedule. By default, this action is subject to the Overlap Policy of the Schedule. This command is helpful when you want to execute a Workflow outside of its scheduled time.

### Update

The update action enables you to update an existing Schedule. This command is useful when you need to modify the Schedule's configuration, such as changing the start time, end time, or interval.

## Timers

A Workflow can set a durable timer for a fixed time period.
In some SDKs, the function is called `sleep()`, and in others, it's called `timer()`.

A Workflow can sleep for months.
Timers are persisted, so even if your Worker or Temporal Cluster is down when the time period completes, as soon as your Worker and Cluster are back up, the `sleep()` call will resolve and your code will continue executing.

Sleeping is a resource-light operation: it does not tie up the process, and you can run millions of Timers off a single Worker.

## Temporal Cron Jobs

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Temporal Cron Job<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cron Job?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.

A Cron Schedule is provided as an option when the call to spawn a Workflow Execution is made.

You can set each Workflow to repeat on a schedule with the `cronSchedule` option:

```typescript
const handle = await client.start(scheduledWorkflow, {
  // ...
  cronSchedule: '* * * * *', // start every minute
});
```

## Namespaces

You can create, update, deprecate or delete your <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Namespaces<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> using either tctl or SDK APIs.

Use Namespaces to isolate your Workflow Executions according to your needs.
For example, you can use Namespaces to match the development lifecycle by having separate `dev` and `prod` Namespaces.
You could also use them to ensure Workflow Executions between different teams never communicate - such as ensuring that the `teamA` Namespace never impacts the `teamB` Namespace.

On Temporal Cloud, use the <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Temporal Cloud UI<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud, use either Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to create and manage a Namespace from the UI, or [tcld commands](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to manage Namespaces from the command-line interface.

## Custom payload conversion

Temporal SDKs provide a <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#payload-converter">Payload Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Payload Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Payload Converter serializes data, converting objects or values to bytes and back.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#payload-converter">Learn more</a></span></span></a> that can be customized to convert a custom data type to <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#payload">Payload<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Payload?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Payload represents binary data such as input and output from Activities and Workflows.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#payload">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and back.

Implementing custom Payload conversion is optional.
It is needed only if the <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#default-data-converter">default Data Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a default Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The default Data Converter is used by the Temporal SDK to convert objects into bytes using a series of Payload Converters.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#default-data-converter">Learn more</a></span></span></a> does not support your custom values.

To support custom Payload conversion, create a <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#custom-payload-conversion">custom Payload Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Payload Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Payload Converter serializes data, converting objects or values to bytes and back.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#custom-payload-conversion">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and configure the Data Converter to use it in your Client options.

The order in which your encoding Payload Converters are applied depend on the order given to the Data Converter.
You can set multiple encoding Payload Converters to run your conversions.
When the Data Converter receives a value for conversion, it passes through each Payload Converter in sequence until the converter that handles the data type does the conversion.
