## Run a development server

This section describes how to install the [Temporal CLI](/cli) and run a development Cluster.
The local development Cluster comes packaged with the [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui).

For information on deploying and running a production Cluster, see the [Cluster deployment guide](/cluster-deployment-guide), or sign up for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud) and let us run your production Cluster for you.

Temporal CLI is a tool for interacting with a Temporal Cluster from the command line and it includes a distribution of the Temporal Server and Web UI.
This local development Cluster runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies and it supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.

**Install the Temporal CLI**

## Connect to a dev Cluster

A <a class="tdlp" href="/temporal#temporal-client">Temporal Client<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Client</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Client, provided by a Temporal SDK, provides a set of APIs to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/temporal#temporal-client">Learn more</a></span></span></a> enables you to communicate with the <a class="tdlp" href="/clusters#">Temporal Cluster<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cluster?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cluster is a Temporal Server paired with Persistence and Visibility stores.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/clusters#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
Communication with a Temporal Cluster includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.

:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.

:::

When you are running a Cluster locally (such as [Temporalite](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#temporalite)), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.
Many SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and [Docker Compose](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#docker-compose) serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).

To initialize a Workflow Client, create an instance of a `WorkflowClient`, create a client-side `WorkflowStub`, and then call a Workflow method (annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`).

To start a Workflow Execution, your Temporal Server must be running, and your front-end service must be accepting gRPC calls.

To establish a connection with the front-end service, use `WorkflowServiceStubs`.

```java
WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
```

You can provide `WorkflowServiceStubsOptions` to override the default values for the gRPC calls.

For example, the default front-end service gRPC address is set to `127.0.0.1:7233`, where `7233` is the default port for the Temporal Frontend Service.

If your server is running on a different host or port from the default, you can set it as shown in the following example.

```java
WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newInstance(
                    WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder()
                     .setTarget(TARGET_ENDPOINT)
                            .build());
```

After the connection to the Temporal Frontend Service is established, create a Client for the service stub.
The Workflow Client helps with client-side APIs and is required by Workers.

Create an instance of a `WorkflowClient` for the Workflow service stub, and use `WorkflowClientOptions` to set options for the Workflow Client.
The following example shows how to create a `WorkflowClient` instance called "client" for the `WorkflowServiceStubs` "service" that we created in the previous example, and set `Namespace` option for the `WorkflowClient`.

```java
WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(
                service,
                WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setNamespace(“Abc”)
                    .build());
```

For more information, see [WorkflowClientOptions](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClientOptions.Builder.html).

`WorkflowService` and `WorkflowClient` creation is a heavyweight operation, and will be resource-intensive if created each time you start a Workflow or send a Signal to it.
The recommended way is to create them once and reuse where possible.

With the Client defined, you can start interacting with the Temporal Frontend Service.

To initialize a Workflow in the Client, create a `WorkflowStub`, and start the Workflow Execution with `WorkflowClient.start()`.
Starting Workflows or sending Signals or Queries to Workflows from within a Client must be done using `WorkflowStubs`.

```java
WorkflowClient workflowClient =  WorkflowClient.newInstance(service, clientOptions);
 // Create a Workflow stub.
 YourWorkflow workflow = workflowClient.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class);
 // Start Workflow asynchronously and call its "yourWFMethod" Workflow method
 WorkflowClient.start(workflow::yourWFMethod);
```

## Develop Workflows

Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Workflow Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

In the Temporal Java SDK programming model, a Workflow Definition comprises a Workflow interface annotated with `@WorkflowInterface` and a Workflow implementation that implements the Workflow interface.

The Workflow interface is a Java interface and is annotated with `@WorkflowInterface`.
Each Workflow interface must have only one method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod`.

```java
// Workflow interface
@WorkflowInterface
public interface YourWorkflow {

    @WorkflowMethod
    String yourWFMethod(Arguments args);
}
```

However, when using dynamic Workflows, do not specify a `@WorkflowMethod`, and implement the `DynamicWorkflow` directly in the Workflow implementation code.

The `@WorkflowMethod` identifies the method that is the starting point of the Workflow Execution.
The Workflow Execution completes when this method completes.

You can create interface inheritance hierarchies to reuse components across other Workflow interfaces.
The interface inheritance approach does not apply to `@WorkflowMethod` annotations.

A Workflow implementation implements a Workflow interface.

```java
// Define the Workflow implementation which implements our getGreeting Workflow method.
  public static class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {
      ...
    }
  }
```

To call Activities in your Workflow, call the Activity implementation.

Use `ExternalWorkflowStub` to start or send Signals from within a Workflow to other running Workflow Executions.

You can also invoke other Workflows as Child Workflows with `Workflow.newChildWorkflowStub()` or `Workflow.newUntypedChildWorkflowStub()` within a Workflow Definition.

Use [`DynamicWorkflow`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/workflow/DynamicWorkflow.html) to implement Workflow Types dynamically.
Register a Workflow implementation type that extends `DynamicWorkflow` to implement any Workflow Type that is not explicitly registered with the Worker.

The dynamic Workflow interface is implemented with the `execute` method. This method takes in `EncodedValues` that are inputs to the Workflow Execution.
These inputs can be specified by the Client when invoking the Workflow Execution.

```java
public class MyDynamicWorkflow implements DynamicWorkflow {
   @Override
    public Object execute(EncodedValues args) {
    }
}
```

### Workflow parameters

Temporal Workflows may have any number of custom parameters.
However, we strongly recommend that objects are used as parameters, so that the object's individual fields may be altered without breaking the signature of the Workflow.
All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable.

A method annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can have any number of parameters.

We recommend passing a single parameter that contains all the input fields to allow for adding fields in a backward-compatible manner.

Note that all inputs should be serializable by the default Jackson JSON Payload Converter.

You can create a custom object and pass it to the Workflow method, as shown in the following example.

```java
//...
@WorkflowInterface
public interface YourWorkflow {
    @WorkflowMethod
    String yourWFMethod(CustomObj customobj);
// ...
}
```

### Workflow return values

Workflow return values must also be serializable.
Returning results, returning errors, or throwing exceptions is fairly idiomatic in each language that is supported.
However, Temporal APIs that must be used to get the result of a Workflow Execution will only ever receive one of either the result or the error.

Workflow method arguments and return values must be serializable and deserializable using the provided [`DataConverter`](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/1.17.0/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html).

The `execute` method for `DynamicWorkflow` can return type Object.
Ensure that your Client can handle an Object type return or is able to convert the Object type response.

- Java DataConverter reference: <https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html>

### Workflow Type

Workflows have a Type that are referred to as the Workflow name.

The following examples demonstrate how to set a custom name for your Workflow Type.

The Workflow Type defaults to the short name of the Workflow interface.
In the following example, the Workflow Type defaults to `NotifyUserAccounts`.

```java
  @WorkflowInterface

  public interface NotifyUserAccounts {
    @WorkflowMethod
    void notify(String[] accountIds);
}
```

To overwrite this default naming and assign a custom Workflow Type, use the `@WorkflowMethod` annotation with the `name` parameter.
In the following example, the Workflow Type is set to `Abc`.

```java
@WorkflowInterface

  public interface NotifyUserAccounts {
  @WorkflowMethod(name = "Abc")
  void notify(String[] accountIds);
  }
```

When you set the Workflow Type this way, the value of the `name` parameter does not have to start with an uppercase letter.

### Workflow logic requirements

Workflow logic is constrained by <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#deterministic-constraints">deterministic execution requirements<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#deterministic-constraints">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
Therefore, each language is limited to the use of certain idiomatic techniques.
However, each Temporal SDK provides a set of APIs that can be used inside your Workflow to interact with external (to the Workflow) application code.

When defining Workflows using the Temporal Java SDK, the Workflow code must be written to execute effectively once and to completion.

The following constraints apply when writing Workflow Definitions:

- Do not use mutable global variables in your Workflow implementations.
  This will ensure that multiple Workflow instances are fully isolated.
- Your Workflow code must be deterministic.
  Do not call non-deterministic functions (such as non-seeded random or `UUID.randomUUID()`) directly from the Workflow code.
  The Temporal SDK provides specific API for calling non-deterministic code in your Workflows.
- Do not use programming language constructs that rely on system time.
  For example, only use `Workflow.currentTimeMillis()` to get the current time inside a Workflow.
- Do not use native Java `Thread` or any other multi-threaded classes like `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
  Use `Async.function` or `Async.procedure`, provided by the Temporal SDK, to execute code asynchronously.
- Do not use synchronization, locks, or other standard Java blocking concurrency-related classes besides those provided by the Workflow class.
  There is no need for explicit synchronization because multi-threaded code inside a Workflow is executed one thread at a time and under a global lock.
  - Call `Workflow.sleep` instead of `Thread.sleep`.
  - Use `Promise` and `CompletablePromise` instead of `Future` and `CompletableFuture`.
  - Use `WorkflowQueue` instead of `BlockingQueue`.
- Use `Workflow.getVersion` when making any changes to the Workflow code.
  Without this, any deployment of updated Workflow code might break already running Workflows.
- Do not access configuration APIs directly from a Workflow because changes in the configuration might affect a Workflow Execution path.
  Pass it as an argument to a Workflow function or use an Activity to load it.
- Use `DynamicWorkflow` when you need a default Workflow that can handle all Workflow Types that are not registered with a Worker.
  A single implementation can implement a Workflow Type which by definition is dynamically loaded from some external source.
  All standard `WorkflowOptions` and determinism rules apply to Dynamic Workflow implementations.

Java Workflow reference: <https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/workflow/package-summary.html>

## Develop Activities

One of the primary things that Workflows do is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
An Activity is a normal function or method execution that's intended to execute a single, well-defined action (either short or long-running), such as querying a database, calling a third-party API, or transcoding a media file.
An Activity can interact with world outside the Temporal Platform or use a Temporal Client to interact with a Cluster.
For the Workflow to be able to execute the Activity, we must define the <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

An <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In day-to-day conversation, the term "Activity" denotes an Activity Type, Activity Definition, or Activity Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a combination of the Temporal Java SDK [Activity](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/0.19.0/io/temporal/activity/Activity.html) Class implementing a specially annotated interface.

An Activity interface is annotated with `@ActivityInterface` and an Activity implementation implements this Activity interface.
To handle Activity types that do not have an explicitly registered handler, you can directly implement a dynamic Activity.

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

Each method defined in the Activity interface defines a separate Activity method.
You can annotate each method in the Activity interface with the `@ActivityMethod` annotation, but this is completely optional.
The following example uses the `@ActivityMethod` annotation for the method defined in the previous example.

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {
    @ActivityMethod
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

An Activity implementation is a Java class that implements an Activity annotated interface.

```java
// Implementation for the GreetingActivities interface example from in the previous section
 static class GreetingActivitiesImpl implements GreetingActivities {
    @Override
    public String composeGreeting(String greeting, String name) {
      return greeting + " " + name + "!";
    }
  }
```

Use `DynamicActivity` to implement any number of Activity types dynamically.
When an Activity implementation that extends `DynamicActivity` is registered, it is called for any Activity type invocation that doesn't have an explicitly registered handler.

The dynamic Activity interface is implemented with the `execute` method, as shown in the following example.

```java
// Dynamic Activity implementation
 public static class DynamicGreetingActivityImpl implements DynamicActivity {
   @Override
   public Object execute(EncodedValues args) {
     String activityType = Activity.getExecutionContext().getInfo().getActivityType();
     return activityType
         + ": "
         + args.get(0, String.class)
         + " "
         + args.get(1, String.class)
         + " from: "
         + args.get(2, String.class);
   }
 }
```

Use `Activity.getExecutionContext()` to get information about the Activity type that should be implemented dynamically.

### Activity parameters

There is no explicit limit to the total number of parameters that an <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a> may support.
However, there is a limit of the total size of the data ends up encoded into a gRPC message Payload.

A single argument is limited to a maximum size of 2 MB.
And the total size of a gRPC message, which includes all the arguments, is limited to a maximum of 4 MB.

Also, keep in mind that all Payload data is recorded in the <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#event-history">Workflow Execution Event History<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Event History?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An append log of Events that represents the full state a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#event-history">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and large Event Histories can affect Worker performance.
This is because the entire Event History could be transferred to a Worker Process with a <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#workflow-task">Workflow Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Task is a Task that contains the context needed to make progress with a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#workflow-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

<!--TODO link to gRPC limit section when available -->

Some SDKs require that you pass context objects, others do not.
When it comes to your application data—that is, data that is serialized and encoded into a Payload—we recommend that you use a single object as an argument that wraps the application data passed to Activities.
This is so that you can change what data is passed to the Activity without breaking a function or method signature.

An Activity interface can have any number of parameters.
All inputs should be serializable by the default Jackson JSON Payload Converter.

When implementing Activities, be mindful of the amount of data that you transfer using the Activity invocation parameters or return values as these are recorded in the Workflow Execution Events History.
Large Events Histories can adversely impact performance.

You can create a custom object, and pass it to the Activity interface, as shown in the following example.

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface YourActivities {
    String getCustomObject(CustomObj customobj);
    void sendCustomObject(CustomObj customobj, String abc);
}
```

The `execute` method in the dynamic Activity interface implementation takes in `EncodedValues` that are inputs to the Activity Execution, as shown in the following example.

```java
// Dynamic Activity implementation
 public static class DynamicActivityImpl implements DynamicActivity {
   @Override
   public Object execute(EncodedValues args) {
     String activityType = Activity.getExecutionContext().getInfo().getActivityType();
     return activityType
         + ": "
         + args.get(0, String.class)
         + " "
         + args.get(1, String.class)
         + " from: "
         + args.get(2, String.class);
   }
 }
```

For more details, see [Dynamic Activity Reference](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/activity/DynamicActivity.html).

### Activity return values

All data returned from an Activity must be serializable.

There is no explicit limit to the amount of data that can be returned by an Activity, but keep in mind that all return values are recorded in a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#event-history">Workflow Execution Event History<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Event History?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An append log of Events that represents the full state a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#event-history">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Activity return values must be serializable and deserializable by the provided [`DataConverter`](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/1.17.0/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html).

The `execute` method for `DynamicActivity` can return type Object.
Ensure that your Workflow or Client can handle an Object type return or is able to convert the Object type response.

- <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#">Data Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>
- Java DataConverter reference: <https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/common/converter/DataConverter.html>

### Activity Type

Activities have a Type that are referred to as the Activity name.
The following examples demonstrate how to set a custom name for your Activity Type.

The Activity Type defaults to method name, with the first letter of the method name capitalized, and can be customized using `namePrefix()` or `{ActivityMethod.name()}` to ensure they are distinct.

In the following example, the Activity Type defaults to `ComposeGreeting`.

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {
    @ActivityMethod
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

To overwrite this default naming and assign a custom Activity Type, use the `@ActivityMethod` annotation with the `name` parameter.
In the following example, the Activity Type is set to "greet".

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {
    @ActivityMethod(name = "greet")
    String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

You can also define a prefix for all of your Activity Types using the `namePrefix` parameter with the `@ActivityInterface` annotation.
The following example shows a `namePrefix` parameter applied to the `@ActivityInterface`, and two Activity methods, of which one is defined using the `@ActivityMethod` annotation.

```java
@ActivityInterface(namePrefix = "A_")
Public interface GreetingActivities {
    String sendGreeting(String input);

  @ActivityMethod(name = "abc")
  String composeGreeting(String greeting, String language);
}
```

In this example, the Activity type for the first method is set to `A_SendGreeting`.
The Activity type for the method annotated with `@ActivityMethod` is set to `A_abc`.

## Activity Execution

Calls to spawn <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-execution">Activity Executions<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a> are written within a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Workflow Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
The call to spawn an Activity Execution generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands/#scheduleactivitytask) Command.
This results in the set of three <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#activity-task">Activity Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task contains the context needed to make an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#activity-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a> related Events ([ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events/#activitytaskscheduled), [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events/#activitytaskstarted), and ActivityTask[Closed])in your Workflow Execution Event History.

A single instance of the Activities implementation is shared across multiple simultaneous Activity invocations.
Therefore, the Activity implementation code must be _stateless_.

The values passed to Activities through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the Execution history.
The entire Execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow Workers when a Workflow state needs to recover.
A large Execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.

Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data you transfer through Activity invocation parameters or Return Values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.

Activities are remote procedure calls that must be invoked from within a Workflow using `ActivityStub`.
Activities are not executable on their own. You cannot start an Activity Execution by itself.

Note that before an Activity Execution is invoked:

- Activity options (either <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout"> `setStartToCloseTimeout`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout"> `ScheduleToCloseTimeout`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule-To-Close Timeout is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall Activity Execution, from when the first Activity Task is scheduled to when the last Activity Task, in the chain of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution, reaches a Closed status.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> are required) must be set for the Activity.
  For details, see [Set Activity Options](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/java/how-to-set-activityoptions-in-java) and [Activity Options reference](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/java/reference-activityoptions).
- The Activity must be registered with a Worker.
  See <a class="tdlp" href="#run-a-dev-worker">Worker Program<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to develop a Worker Program in Java</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Use the `newWorker` method on an instance of a `WorkerFactory` to create a new Worker in Java.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#run-a-dev-worker">Learn more</a></span></span></a>
- Activity code must be thread-safe.

Activities should only be instantiated using stubs from within a Workflow.
An `ActivityStub` returns a client-side stub that implements an Activity interface.
You can invoke Activities using `Workflow.newActivityStub`(type-safe) or `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub` (untyped).

Calling a method on the Activity interface schedules the Activity invocation with the Temporal service, and generates an <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#activitytaskscheduled"> `ActivityTaskScheduled` Event<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Event?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Events are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to external occurrences and Commands generated by a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#activitytaskscheduled">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Activities can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously.

**Invoking Activities Synchronously**

In the following example, we use the type-safe `Workflow.newActivityStub` within the "FileProcessingWorkflow" Workflow implementation to create a client-side stub of the `FileProcessingActivities` class. We also define `ActivityOptions` and set `setStartToCloseTimeout` option to one hour.

```java
public class FileProcessingWorkflowImpl implements FileProcessingWorkflow {

    private final FileProcessingActivities activities;

    public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {
        this.activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(
                FileProcessingActivities.class,
                ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofHours(1))
                        .build());
    }

    @Override
    public void processFile(Arguments args) {
        String localName = null;
        String processedName = null;
        try {
            localName = activities.download(args.getSourceBucketName(), args.getSourceFilename());
            processedName = activities.processFile(localName);
            activities.upload(args.getTargetBucketName(), args.getTargetFilename(), processedName);
        } finally {
            if (localName != null) {
                activities.deleteLocalFile(localName);
            }
            if (processedName != null) {
                activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);
            }
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

A Workflow can have multiple Activity stubs. Each Activity stub can have its own `ActivityOptions` defined.
The following example shows a Workflow implementation with two typed Activity stubs.

```java
public FileProcessingWorkflowImpl() {
    ActivityOptions options1 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
             .setTaskQueue("taskQueue1")
             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(10))
             .build();
    this.store1 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options1);

    ActivityOptions options2 = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
             .setTaskQueue("taskQueue2")
             .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
             .build();
    this.store2 = Workflow.newActivityStub(FileProcessingActivities.class, options2);
}
```

To invoke Activities inside Workflows without referencing the interface it implements, use an untyped Activity stub `Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub`.
This is useful when the Activity type is not known at compile time, or to invoke Activities implemented in different programming languages.

```java
   // Workflow code
    ActivityOptions activityOptions =
        ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3))
        .setTaskQueue("simple-queue-node")
        .build();

    ActivityStub activity = Workflow.newUntypedActivityStub(activityOptions);
    activity.execute("ComposeGreeting", String.class, "Hello World" , "Spanish");
```

**Invoking Activities Asynchronously**

Sometimes Workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.
The Temporal Java SDK provides the `Async` class which includes static methods used to invoke any Activity asynchronously.
The calls return a result of type `Promise` which is similar to the Java `Future` and `CompletionStage`.
When invoking Activities, use `Async.function` for Activities that return a result, and `Async.procedure` for Activities that return void.

In the following asynchronous Activity invocation, the method reference is passed to `Async.function` followed by Activity arguments.

```java
Promise<String> localNamePromise = Async.function(activities::download, sourceBucket, sourceFile);
```

The following example shows how to call two Activity methods, "download" and "upload", in parallel on multiple files.

```java
  public void processFile(Arguments args) {
    List<Promise<String>> localNamePromises = new ArrayList<>();
    List<String> processedNames = null;
    try {
      // Download all files in parallel.
      for (String sourceFilename : args.getSourceFilenames()) {
        Promise<String> localName =
            Async.function(activities::download, args.getSourceBucketName(), sourceFilename);
        localNamePromises.add(localName);
      }
      List<String> localNames = new ArrayList<>();
      for (Promise<String> localName : localNamePromises) {
        localNames.add(localName.get());
      }
      processedNames = activities.processFiles(localNames);

      // Upload all results in parallel.
      List<Promise<Void>> uploadedList = new ArrayList<>();
      for (String processedName : processedNames) {
        Promise<Void> uploaded =
            Async.procedure(
                activities::upload,
                args.getTargetBucketName(),
                args.getTargetFilename(),
                processedName);
        uploadedList.add(uploaded);
      }
      // Wait for all uploads to complete.
      Promise.allOf(uploadedList).get();
    } finally {
      for (Promise<String> localNamePromise : localNamePromises) {
        // Skip files that haven't completed downloading.
        if (localNamePromise.isCompleted()) {
          activities.deleteLocalFile(localNamePromise.get());
        }
      }
      if (processedNames != null) {
        for (String processedName : processedNames) {
          activities.deleteLocalFile(processedName);
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

**Activity Execution Context**

`ActivityExecutionContext` is a context object passed to each Activity implementation by default.
You can access it in your Activity implementations via `Activity.getExecutionContext()`.

It provides getters to access information about the Workflow that invoked the Activity.
Note that the Activity context information is stored in a thread-local variable.
Therefore, calls to `getExecutionContext()` succeed only within the thread that invoked the Activity function.

Following is an example of using the `ActivityExecutionContext`:

```java
public class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {

  @Override
  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {

    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();
    ActivityInfo info = ctx.getInfo();

    log.info("namespace=" +  info.getActivityNamespace());
    log.info("workflowId=" + info.getWorkflowId());
    log.info("runId=" + info.getRunId());
    log.info("activityId=" + info.getActivityId());
    log.info("activityTimeout=" + info.getStartToCloseTimeout();

    return downloadFileFromS3(bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);
  }
    ...
}
```

For details on getting the results of an Activity Execution, see <a class="tdlp" href="#activity-execution-result">Activity Execution Result<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to get the result of an Activity Execution</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To get the results of an asynchronously invoked Activity method, use the `Promise` `get` method to block until the Activity method result is available.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#activity-execution-result">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

### Required timeout

Activity Execution semantics rely on several parameters.
The only required value that needs to be set is either a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Schedule-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Start-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
These values are set in the Activity Options.

Set your Activity Timeout from the [`ActivityOptions.Builder`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/activity/ActivityOptions.Builder.html) class.

Available timeouts are:

- ScheduleToCloseTimeout()
- ScheduleToStartTimeout()
- StartToCloseTimeout()

You can set Activity Options using an `ActivityStub` within a Workflow implementation, or per-Activity using `WorkflowImplementationOptions` within a Worker.

The following uses `ActivityStub`.

```java
GreetingActivities activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(GreetingActivities.class,
                ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setScheduleToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                        // .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2)
                        // .setScheduletoCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(20))
                        .build());
```

The following uses `WorkflowImplementationOptions`.

```java
WorkflowImplementationOptions options =
            WorkflowImplementationOptions.newBuilder()
                    .setActivityOptions(
                            ImmutableMap.of(
                                    "GetCustomerGreeting",
                                    // Set Activity Execution timeout
                                    ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
                                        .setScheduleToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                                        // .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
                                        // .setScheduleToStartTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
                                        .build()))
                    .build();
```

:::note

If you define options per-Activity Type options with `WorkflowImplementationOptions.setActivityOptions()`, setting them again specifically with `ActivityStub` in a Workflow will override this setting.

:::

### Activity Options reference

Use [`ActivityOptions`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/activity/ActivityOptions.Builder.html) to configure how to invoke an Activity Execution.

You can set Activity Options using an `ActivityStub` within a Workflow implementation, or per-Activity using `WorkflowImplementationOptions` within a Worker.
Note that if you define options per-Activity Type options with `WorkflowImplementationOptions.setActivityOptions()`, setting them again specifically with `ActivityStub` in a Workflow will override this setting.

The following table lists all `ActivityOptions` that can be configured for an Activity invocation.

| Option                                                 | Required                                           | Type                     |

  Note that if `WorkflowRunTimeout` and/or `WorkflowExecutionTimeout` are defined in the Workflow, all Activity retries will stop when either or both of these timeouts are reached.

You can set Activity Options using an `ActivityStub` within a Workflow implementation, or per-Activity using `WorkflowImplementationOptions` within a Worker.
Note that if you define options per-Activity Type options with `WorkflowImplementationOptions.setActivityOptions()`, setting them again specifically with `ActivityStub` in a Workflow will override this setting.

### Activity Execution Result

The call to spawn an <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a> generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands/#scheduleactivitytask) Command and provides the Workflow with an Awaitable.
Workflow Executions can either block progress until the result is available through the Awaitable or continue progressing, making use of the result when it becomes available.

To get the results of an asynchronously invoked Activity method, use the `Promise` `get` method to block until the Activity method result is available.

Sometimes an Activity Execution lifecycle goes beyond a synchronous method invocation.
For example, a request can be put in a queue and later a reply comes and is picked up by a different Worker process.
The whole request-reply interaction can be modeled as a single Activity.

To indicate that an Activity should not be completed upon its method return, call `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()` from the original Activity thread.

Then later, when replies come, complete the Activity using the `ActivityCompletionClient`.
To correlate Activity invocation with completion, use either a `TaskToken` or Workflow and Activity Ids.

Following is an example of using `ActivityExecutionContext.doNotCompleteOnReturn()`:

```java
public class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {

  public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {

    ActivityExecutionContext ctx = Activity.getExecutionContext();

    // Used to correlate reply
    byte[] taskToken = ctx.getInfo().getTaskToken();

    asyncDownloadFileFromS3(taskToken, bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);
    ctx.doNotCompleteOnReturn();

    // Return value is ignored when doNotCompleteOnReturn was called.
    return "ignored";
  }
  ...
}
```

When the download is complete, the download service potentially can complete the Activity, or fail it from a different process, for example:

```java
  public <R> void completeActivity(byte[] taskToken, R result) {
    completionClient.complete(taskToken, result);
  }

  public void failActivity(byte[] taskToken, Exception failure) {
    completionClient.completeExceptionally(taskToken, failure);
  }
```

Although multiple Worker Entities can be in a single Worker Process, a single Worker Entity Worker Process may be perfectly sufficient.
For more information, see the [Worker tuning guide](/dev-guide/worker-performance).

A Worker Entity contains both a Workflow Worker and an Activity Worker so that it can make progress for either a Workflow Execution or an Activity Execution.

Use the `newWorker` method on an instance of a [`WorkerFactory`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/worker/WorkerFactory.html) to create a new Worker in Java.

A single Worker Entity can contain many Worker Objects.
Call the `start()` method on the instance of the `WorkerFactory` to start all the Workers created in this process.

    Worker yourWorker = factory.newWorker("your_task_queue");

    // Register Workflow
    // and/or register Activities

    factory.start();
  }
}
```

After creating the Worker entity, register all Workflow Types and all Activity Types that the Worker can execute.
A Worker can be registered with just Workflows, just Activities, or both.

**Operation guides:**

- [How to tune Workers](/dev-guide/worker-performance)

### Register types

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it fails that Task.
However, the failure of the Task does not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

Use `worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes` to register Workflow Type and `worker.registerActivitiesImplementations` to register Activity implementation with Workers.

For Workflows, the Workflow Type is registered with a Worker.
A Workflow Type can be registered only once per Worker entity.
If you define multiple Workflow implementations of the same type, you get an exception at the time of registration.

For Activities, Activity implementation instances are registered with a Worker because they are stateless and thread-safe.
You can pass any number of dependencies in the Activity implementation constructor, such as the database connections, services, etc.

The following example shows how to register a Workflow and an Activity with a Worker.

```java
Worker worker = workerFactory.newWorker("your_task_queue");
...
// Register Workflow
worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(GreetingWorkflowImpl.class);
// Register Activity
worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new GreetingActivitiesImpl());
```

When you register a single instance of an Activity, you can have multiple instances of Workflow Executions calling the same Activity.
Activity code must be thread-safe because the same instance of the Activity code is run for every Workflow Execution that calls it.

For `DynamicWorkflow`, only one Workflow implementation that extends `DynamicWorkflow` can be registered with a Worker.
The following example shows how to register the `DynamicWorkflow` and `DynamicActivity` implementation with a Worker.

```java
  public static void main(String[] arg) {

    WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newInstance();
    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
    WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);
    Worker worker = factory.newWorker(TASK_QUEUE);

    /* Register the Dynamic Workflow implementation with the Worker. Workflow implementations
    ** must be known to the Worker at runtime to dispatch Workflow Tasks.
    */
    worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(DynamicGreetingWorkflowImpl.class);

    // Start all the Workers that are in this process.
    factory.start();

    /* Create the Workflow stub. Note that the Workflow Type is not explicitly registered with the Worker. */
    WorkflowOptions workflowOptions =
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).setWorkflowId(WORKFLOW_ID).build();
    WorkflowStub workflow = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub("DynamicWF", workflowOptions);
    /**
     * Register Dynamic Activity implementation with the Worker. Since Activities are stateless
     * and thread-safe, we need to register a shared instance.
    */
    worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new DynamicGreetingActivityImpl());

    /* Start Workflow Execution and immmediately send Signal. Pass in the Workflow args and Signal args. */
    workflow.signalWithStart("greetingSignal", new Object[] {"John"}, new Object[] {"Hello"});

    // Wait for the Workflow to finish getting the results.
    String result = workflow.getResult(String.class);

    System.out.println(result);

    System.exit(0);
  }
}
```

You can register multiple type-specific Workflow implementations alongside a single `DynamicWorkflow` implementation.
You can register only one Activity instance that implements `DynamicActivity` with a Worker.

## Start Workflow Execution

[Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) semantics rely on several parameters—that is, to start a Workflow Execution you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type, language-specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

In the examples below, all Workflow Executions are started using a Temporal Client.
To spawn Workflow Executions from within another Workflow Execution, use either the [Child Workflow](#child-workflows) or External Workflow APIs.

See the [Customize Workflow Type](#customize-workflow-type) section to see how to customize the name of the Workflow Type.

A request to spawn a Workflow Execution causes the Temporal Cluster to create the first Event ([WorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events/#workflowexecutionstarted)) in the Workflow Execution Event History.
The Temporal Cluster then creates the first Workflow Task, resulting in the first [WorkflowTaskScheduled](/references/events/#workflowtaskscheduled) Event.

Use `WorkflowStub` to start a Workflow Execution from within a Client, and `ExternalWorkflowStub` to start a different Workflow Execution from within a Workflow.

See <a class="tdlp" href="/dev-guide/java/features#signal-with-start"> `SignalwithStart`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to send a Signal-with-Start in Java</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To send Signals to a Workflow Execution whose status is unknown, use `SignalWithStart` with a `WorkflowStub` in the Client code.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dev-guide/java/features#signal-with-start">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to start a Workflow Execution to receive a Signal from within another Workflow.

**Using `WorkflowStub`**

`WorkflowStub` is a proxy generated by the `WorkflowClient`.
Each time a new Workflow Execution is started, an instance of the Workflow implementation object is created.
Then, one of the methods (depending on the Workflow Type of the instance) annotated with `@WorkflowMethod` can be invoked.
As soon as this method returns, the Workflow Execution is considered to be complete.

You can use a typed or untyped `WorkflowStub` in the client code.

- Typed `WorkflowStub` are useful because they are type safe and allow you to invoke your Workflow methods such as `@WorkflowMethod`, `@QueryMethod`, and `@SignalMethod` directly.
- An untyped `WorkflowStub` does not use the Workflow interface, and is not type safe. It is more flexible because it has methods from the `WorkflowStub` interface, such as `start`, `signalWithStart`, `getResults` (sync and async), `query`, `signal`, `cancel` and `terminate`.
  Note that the Temporal Java SDK also provides typed `WorkflowStub` versions for these methods.
  When using untyped `WorkflowStub`, we rely on the Workflow Type, Activity Type, Child Workflow Type, as well as Query and Signal names.
  For details, see <a class="tdlp" href="#connect-to-a-dev-cluster">Temporal Client<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create a Temporal Client in Java</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To initialize a Workflow Client, create an instance of a `WorkflowClient`, create a client-side `WorkflowStub`, and then call a Workflow method (annotated with the `@WorkflowMethod` annotation).</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#connect-to-a-dev-cluster">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

A Workflow Execution can be started either synchronously or asynchronously.

- Synchronous invocation starts a Workflow and then waits for its completion. If the process that started the Workflow crashes or stops waiting, the Workflow continues executing.
  Because Workflows are potentially long-running, and Client crashes happen, it is not very commonly found in production use.
  The following example is a type-safe approach for starting a Workflow Execution synchronously.

  ```java
    NotifyUserAccounts workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(
          NotifyUserAccounts.class,
          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                  .setWorkflowId("notifyAccounts")
                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                  .build()
          );

  // start the Workflow and wait for a result.
    workflow.notify(new String[] { "Account1", "Account2", "Account3", "Account4", "Account5",
                  "Account6", "Account7", "Account8", "Account9", "Account10"});
      }
  // notify(String[] accountIds) is a Workflow method defined in the Workflow Definition.
  ```

- Asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller. This is the most common way to start Workflows in production code.
  The `WorkflowClient` <https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClient.java)> provides some static methods, such as `start`, `execute`, `signalWithStart` etc., that help with starting your Workflows asynchronously.

  The following examples show how to start Workflow Executions asynchronously, with either typed or untyped `WorkflowStub`.

  - **Typed WorkflowStub Example**

    ```java
    // create typed Workflow stub
    FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(FileProcessingWorkflow.class,
          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                  .build());
    // use WorkflowClient.execute to return future that contains Workflow result or failure, or
    // use WorkflowClient.start to return WorkflowId and RunId of the started Workflow).
    WorkflowClient.start(workflow::greetCustomer);
    ```

  - **Untyped WorkflowStub Example**

    ```java
    WorkflowStub untyped = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub("FileProcessingWorkflow",
          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                  .build());

    // blocks until Workflow Execution has been started (not until it completes)
    untyped.start(argument);
    ```

You can call a Dynamic Workflow implementation using an untyped `WorkflowStub`.
The following example shows how to call the Dynamic Workflow implementation in the Client code.

```java
    WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
    /**
      * Note that for this part of the client code, the dynamic Workflow implementation must
      * be known to the Worker at runtime in order to dispatch Workflow tasks, and may be defined
      * in the Worker definition as:*/
    // worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(DynamicGreetingWorkflowImpl.class);

    /* Create the Workflow stub to call the dynamic Workflow.
    * Note that the Workflow Type is not explicitly registered with the Worker.*/
    WorkflowOptions workflowOptions =
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder().setTaskQueue(TASK_QUEUE).setWorkflowId(WORKFLOW_ID).build();
    WorkflowStub workflow = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub("DynamicWF", workflowOptions);
```

`DynamicWorkflow` can be used to invoke different Workflow Types.
To check what type is running when your Dynamic Workflow `execute` method runs, use `getWorkflowType()` in the implementation code.

```java
String type = Workflow.getInfo().getWorkflowType();
```

See <a class="tdlp" href="#get-workflow-results">Workflow Execution Result<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to get the result of a Workflow Execution in Java</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A synchronous Workflow Execution blocks your client thread until the Workflow Execution completes (or fails) and get the results (or error in case of failure). An asynchronous Workflow Execution immediately returns a value to the caller.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#get-workflow-results">Learn more</a></span></span></a> for details on how to get the results of the Workflow Execution.

**Using `ExternalWorkflowStub`**

Use `ExternalWorkflowStub` within a Workflow to invoke, and send Signals to, other Workflows by type.

This helps particularly for executing Workflows written in other language SDKs, as shown in the following example.

```java
@Override
  public String yourWFMethod(String name) {
      ExternalWorkflowStub callOtherWorkflow = Workflow.newUntypedExternalWorkflowStub("OtherWFId");
    }
```

See the [Temporal Polyglot](https://github.com/tsurdilo/temporal-polyglot) code for examples of executing Workflows written in other language SDKs.

**Recurring start**

You can start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule by using <a class="tdlp" href="/dev-guide/java/features#cron-schedule"> `setCronSchedule`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to set a Cron Schedule in Java</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Set the Cron Schedule with the `WorkflowStub` instance in the Client code using [`WorkflowOptions.Builder.setCronSchedule`</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dev-guide/java/features#cron-schedule">Learn more</a></span></span></a> Workflow option in the Client code.

### Set Task Queue

In most SDKs, the only Workflow Option that must be set is the name of the <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#task-queue">Task Queue<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Task Queue?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Task Queue is a first-in, first-out queue that a Worker Process polls for Tasks.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#task-queue">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

For any code to execute, a Worker Process must be running that contains a Worker Entity that is polling the same Task Queue name.

Set the Workflow Task Queue with the [`WorkflowStub`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowStub.html) instance in the Client code using [`WorkflowOptions.Builder.setTaskQueue`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html).

- Type: `String`
- Default: none

```java
//create Workflow stub for YourWorkflowInterface
YourWorkflowInterface workflow1 =
    WorkerGreet.greetclient.newWorkflowStub(
        GreetWorkflowInterface.class,
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                .setWorkflowId("YourWF")
                // Set the Task Queue
                .setTaskQueue(WorkerGreet.TASK_QUEUE)
                .build());
```

### Workflow Id

Although it is not required, we recommend providing your own <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-id">Workflow Id<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Id?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Id is a customizable, application-level identifier for a Workflow Execution that is unique to an Open Workflow Execution within a Namespace.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-id">Learn more</a></span></span></a> that maps to a business process or business entity identifier, such as an order identifier or customer identifier.

Set the Workflow Id with the [`WorkflowStub`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowStub.html) instance in the Client code using [`WorkflowOptions.Builder.setWorkflowId​`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html).

- Type: `String`
- Default: none

```java
//create Workflow stub for YourWorkflowInterface
YourWorkflowInterface workflow1 =
    WorkerGreet.greetclient.newWorkflowStub(
        GreetWorkflowInterface.class,
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                // Set the Workflow Id
                .setWorkflowId("YourWF")
                .setTaskQueue(WorkerGreet.TASK_QUEUE)
                .build());
```

### Workflow Options reference

Create a [`newWorkflowStub`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowStub.html) in the Temporal Client code, call the instance of the Workflow, and set the Workflow options with the [`WorkflowOptions.Builder`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html) class.

                .setWorkflowTaskTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                .build());
```

#### WorkflowIDReusePolicy

- Type: `WorkflowIdReusePolicy`
- Default: `AllowDuplicate`
- Values: - `enums.AllowDuplicateFailedOnly`: The Workflow can start if the earlier Workflow Execution failed, Canceled, or Terminated. - `AllowDuplicate`: The Workflow can start regardless of the earlier Execution's closure status. - `RejectDuplicate`: The Workflow can not start if there is a earlier Run.

```java
//create Workflow stub for GreetWorkflowInterface
GreetWorkflowInterface workflow1 =
    WorkerGreet.greetclient.newWorkflowStub(
        GreetWorkflowInterface.class,
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                .setWorkflowId("GreetWF")
                .setTaskQueue(WorkerGreet.TASK_QUEUE)
                // Set Workflow Id Reuse Policy
                .setWorkflowIdReusePolicy(
                        WorkflowIdReusePolicy.WORKFLOW_ID_REUSE_POLICY_REJECT_DUPLICATE)
                .build());
```

#### RetryOptions

To set a Workflow Retry Options in the [`WorkflowStub`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowStub.html) instance use [`WorkflowOptions.Builder.setWorkflowRetryOptions`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html).

- Type: `RetryOptions`
- Default: `Null` which means no retries will be attempted.

```java
//create Workflow stub for GreetWorkflowInterface
GreetWorkflowInterface workflow1 =
    WorkerGreet.greetclient.newWorkflowStub(
        GreetWorkflowInterface.class,
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                .setWorkflowId("GreetWF")
                .setTaskQueue(WorkerGreet.TASK_QUEUE)
                // Set Workflow Retry Options
                .setRetryOptions(RetryOptions.newBuilder()
                .build());
```

#### CronSchedule

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Temporal Cron Job<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cron Job?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.

A Cron Schedule is provided as an option when the call to spawn a Workflow Execution is made.

Set the Cron Schedule with the [`WorkflowStub`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowStub.html) instance in the Client code using [`WorkflowOptions.Builder.setCronSchedule`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html).

Setting `setCronSchedule` changes the Workflow Execution into a Temporal Cron Job.
The default timezone for a Cron is UTC.

- Type: `String`
- Default: None

```java
//create Workflow stub for YourWorkflowInterface
YourWorkflowInterface workflow1 =
    YourWorker.yourclient.newWorkflowStub(
        YourWorkflowInterface.class,
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                .setWorkflowId("YourWF")
                .setTaskQueue(YourWorker.TASK_QUEUE)
                // Set Cron Schedule
                .setCronSchedule("* * * * *")
                .build());
```

For more details, see the [Cron Sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/blob/main/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/hello/HelloCron.java)

#### Memo

- Type: `String`
- Default: None

```java
//create Workflow stub for GreetWorkflowInterface
GreetWorkflowInterface workflow1 =
    WorkerGreet.greetclient.newWorkflowStub(
        GreetWorkflowInterface.class,
        WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                .setWorkflowId("GreetWF")
                .setTaskQueue(WorkerGreet.TASK_QUEUE)
                // Set Memo. You can set additional non-indexed info via Memo
                        .setMemo(ImmutableMap.of(
                                "memoKey", "memoValue"
                        ))
                .build());
```

#### SearchAttributes

Search Attributes are additional indexed information attributed to Workflow and used for search and visibility.
These can be used in a query of List/Scan/Count Workflow APIs.
The key and its value type must be registered on Temporal server side.

- Type: `Map<String, Object>`
- Default: None

```java
private static void parentWorkflow() {
        ChildWorkflowOptions childworkflowOptions =
                ChildWorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                        // Set Search Attributes
                        .setSearchAttributes(ImmutableMap.of("MySearchAttributeNAme", "value"))
                        .build();
```

The following Java types are supported:

- String
- Long, Integer, Short, Byte
- Boolean
- Double
- OffsetDateTime
- Collection of the types in this list.

### Get Workflow results

If the call to start a Workflow Execution is successful, you will gain access to the Workflow Execution's Run Id.

The Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace may be used to uniquely identify a Workflow Execution in the system and get its result.

It's possible to both block progress on the result (synchronous execution) or get the result at some other point in time (asynchronous execution).

In the Temporal Platform, it's also acceptable to use Queries as the preferred method for accessing the state and results of Workflow Executions.

A synchronous Workflow Execution blocks your client thread until the Workflow Execution completes (or fails) and get the results (or error in case of failure).

The following example is a type-safe approach for getting the results of a synchronous Workflow Execution.

```java
 FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(
                FileProcessingWorkflow.class,
                WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                        .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                        .build();

// start sync and wait for results (or failure)
String result = workflow.processfile(new Argument());
```

An asynchronous Workflow Execution immediately returns a value to the caller.

The following examples show how to get the results of a Workflow Execution through typed and untyped `WorkflowStub`.

- **Typed WorkflowStub Example**

  ```java
  // create typed Workflow stub
  FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(FileProcessingWorkflow.class,
                WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                        .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                        .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                        .build());
  // use WorkflowClient.execute (if your Workflow takes in arguments) or WorkflowClient.start (for zero arguments)
  WorkflowClient.start(workflow::greetCustomer);
  ```

- **Untyped WorkflowStub Example**

  ```java
  WorkflowStub untyped = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub("FileProcessingWorkflow",
                  WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                          .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                          .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                          .build());

  // blocks until Workflow Execution has been started (not until it completes)
  untyped.start(argument);
  ```

If you need to wait for a Workflow Execution to complete after an asynchronous start, the most straightforward way is to call the blocking Workflow instance again.

Note that if `WorkflowOptions.WorkflowIdReusePolicy` is not set to `AllowDuplicate`, then instead of throwing `DuplicateWorkflowException`, it reconnects to an existing Workflow and waits for its completion.

The following example shows how to do this from a different process than the one that started the Workflow Execution.

```java
YourWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow.class, workflowId);

// Returns the result after waiting for the Workflow to complete.
String result = workflow.yourMethod();
```

Another way to connect to an existing Workflow and wait for its completion from another process, is to use `UntypedWorkflowStub`. For example:

```java
WorkflowStub workflowStub = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub(workflowType, workflowOptions);

// Returns the result after waiting for the Workflow to complete.
String result = untyped.getResult(String.class);
```

**Get last (successful) completion result**

For a Temporal Cron Job, get the result of previous successful runs using `GetLastCompletionResult()`.
The method returns `null` if there is no previous completion.
The following example shows how to implement this in a Workflow.

```java
public String cronWorkflow() {
    String lastProcessedFileName = Workflow.getLastCompletionResult(String.class);

    // Process work starting from the lastProcessedFileName.
    // Business logic implementation goes here.
    // Updates lastProcessedFileName to the new value.

    return lastProcessedFileName;
}
```

Note that this works even if one of the Cron schedule runs failed.
The next schedule will still get the last successful result if it ever successfully completed at least once.
For example, for a daily cron Workflow, if the run succeeds on the first day and fails on the second day, then the third day run will get the result from first day's run using these APIs.
