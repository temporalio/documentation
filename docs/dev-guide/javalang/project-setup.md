2. Extract the downloaded archive.

3. Add the `temporal.exe` binary to your PATH.

## Choose a development Cluster {#choose-dev-cluster}

**Which development Cluster should you choose?**

We recommend choosing a development environment based on your requirements.

The source code for the Temporal Server (the orchestrating component of the Temporal Cluster) is licensed under the MIT open source license. So, in theory, anyone can take the Temporal Server code and run their Temporal Platform in any number of creative ways.

However, for most developers we recommend starting by choosing one of the following:

- [Local development server](#local-dev-server)
- [Temporal Cloud](#temporal-cloud)
- [Self-hosted Temporal Cluster](#self-hosted-temporal-cluster)

:::info Temporal does not directly run your code

Keep in mind that in every scenario, the “Temporal Platform” does not host and run your Workers (application code).
It is up to you, the developer, to host your application code.
The Temporal Platform ensures that properly written code durably executes in the face of platform-level failures.

:::

### Local dev server

**When to use a local development server?**

We recommend using the local development server if you are new to Temporal, or want to start something from scratch and don’t have a self-hosted environment ready or want to pay for a Temporal Cloud account.

The Temporal CLI comes bundled with a development server and provides a fast way to start running Temporal Applications.

However, the local development server does not emit any metrics.
If you are eager to to set up Cluster-level metrics for performance tuning, we recommend using a self-hosted Cluster or Temporal Cloud.

#### Start the dev server

**How to start a local development server**

If you have successfully installed the Temporal CLI, open a new terminal and run the following command:

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

This command automatically starts the Temporal Web UI, creates a default Namespace, and creates an in-memory database.

The Temporal Web UI serves to [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233/).

For more command details and options, see the [CLI reference](/cli/server#start-dev)

#### Create a custom Namespace

**How to create a Namespace on the development server**

The development server does automatically create a default Namespace (named "default") when it starts up.
However, you will create a custom one for our application.
Since this is something recommended at a production level, it's recommend practicing it with the development server.

Use the `temporal operator namespace create` command using the Temporal CLI to create a Namespace on the development server.

```bash
temporal operator namespace create backgroundcheck_namespace
```

For command details and options, see the [CLI reference](/cli/operator#create).

### Temporal Cloud

**When to use Temporal Cloud**

If you do not have a Temporal Cloud Account, you can request one using the link on the [Get started with Temporal Cloud](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/get-started) guide.

We recommend starting off with Temporal Cloud if you already have a production use case, or need to move a scalable proof of concept into production.

In other words, Temporal Cloud is perfect if you are ready to run at scale and don’t want the overhead of managing your own self-hosted Cluster.

To create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud, follow the instructions in [How to create a Namespace](/cloud/namespaces#create-a-namespace).

:::info Safely store your certificate and private key

Store certificates and private keys generated for your Namespace as files or environment variables in your project.
You need access to your certificate and key to run your Workers and start Workflows.

For more information on certificate requirements, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates#).

:::

### Self-hosted Temporal Cluster

We recommend using a self-hosted environment if you are starting something new and need to scale with production-level features, but don’t yet need or want to pay for Temporal Cloud.

For example, running a self-hosted Cluster lets you try different databases, view Cluster metrics, use custom [Search Attributes](/visibility#search-attribute), and even play with the [Archival](/clusters#archival) feature.

It's completely possible to run a production level self-hosted Cluster.
However, for the purposes of this guide, we show how to use a self-hosted environment that runs completely out of Docker.
We acknowledge that it takes a fair amount of experience to elevate from a self-hosted environment in Docker to something that can run at an enterprise production scale.
The self-hosted information in this guide should help you make more informed decisions.

To follow along with self-hosted parts of this guide, install the following:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).

Then, clone the [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git) repository.

Change directory into the root of the project.

Run the `docker compose up` command.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
cd  docker-compose
docker compose up
```

Create a command alias for the Temporal CLI:

```shell
alias temporal_docker="docker exec temporal-admin-tools temporal"
```

Create a Namespace.

```shell
temporal_docker operator namespace create backgroundcheck_namespace
```

## Boilerplate Temporal Application project code {#boilerplate-project}

**What is the minimum code I need to create a boilerplate Temporal Application?**

Let’s start with a single Activity Workflow and register those functions with a Worker.

After we get the Worker running and have started a Workflow Execution, we will add a testing framework.

### Project structure

You can organize Temporal Application code to suit various needs in a way that aligns with the idiomatic style of the language you are working in.
This includes structuring your files according to your organization's best practices.

However, there are some general ways to think about organizing code.

The best practice is to group Workflows together, Activities together, and separate your Worker process into a standalone file.
Often this happens respectively per use case, business process, or domain.

For monorepo-style organizational techniques, consider a designated Workflow directory for each use case and place each Workflow in its own file, but also maintain a dedicated place for shared Activities.

For example, your project structure could look like this (the upper sections of the package structure, ex: `com.example.mycorp`, has been omitted for simplicity):

```text
/monorepo
    /src
        /main
            /java
                /sharedactivities
                    | PaymentActivities.java
                    | PaymentActivitiesImpl.java
                    | SendEmailActivities.java
                    | SendEmailActivitiesImpl.java
                /backgroundcheck
                    /workflows
                        | BackgroundCheckWorkflow.java
                        | BackgroundCheckWorkflowImpl.java
                    /activities
                        | SsnTraceActivities.java
                        | SsnTraceActivitiesImpl.java
                    /worker
                        | BackgroundCheckWorker.java
                /loanapplication
                    /workflows
                        | LoanApplicationWorkflow.java
                        | LoanApplicationWorkflowImpl.java
                    /activities
                        | CreditCheckActivities.java
                        | CreditCheckActivitiesImpl.java
                    /worker
                        | LoanApplicationWorker.java
            /resources
                | logback.xml
        /test
            /java
                /sharedactivities
                    | PaymentActivitiesTest.java
                    | SendEmailActivitiesTest.java
                /backgroundcheck
                    /workflows
                        | BackgroundCheckWorkflowTest.java
                        | BackgroundCheckWorkflowIntegrationTest.java
                    /activities
                        | SsnTraceActivitiesTest.java
                /loanapplication
                    /workflows
                        | LoanApplicationWorkflowTest.java
                        | LoanApplicationWorkflowIntegrationTest.java
                    /activities
                        | CreditCheckActivitiesTest.java
```

If you are following along with this guide, your project will look like this:

```text
/backgroundcheck
    /src
        /main
            /java
                /backgroundcheckboilerplate
                    / workers
                        | CloudWorker.java
                        | DevServerWorker.java
                        | SelfHostedWorker.java
                    | BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivities.java
                    | BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl.java
                    | BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow.java
                    | BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowImpl.java
        /test
            /java
                /backgroundcheckboilerplate
                    | BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesTest.java
                    | BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowIntegrationTest.java
                    | BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowTest.java
```

### Initialize a Java project with Maven

If you have created a similar project structure as noted earlier and are using
Maven as your dependency management tool, ensure that the `compiler.source`
and `compiler.target` properties in your `pom.xml` are set to at least `1.8`.

```xml
<properties>
  <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
  <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
  <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
```

Next, including the following dependencies in the `dependencies` section of your
`pom.xml` to install the Temporal SDK and necessary testing packages for this guide.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.temporal</groupId>
    <artifactId>temporal-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>1.20.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Finally, run `mvn clean compile` to perform the first compilation and pull in
the dependencies.

### Initialize a Java project with Gradle

If you are using Gradle as your dependency manager, add the Temporal SDK
to the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle` file

```text
dependencies {
    implementation group: 'io.temporal', name: 'temporal-sdk', version: '1.20.1'
}
```

Next, run `./gradlew build` to perform a test build of your application and download
the dependencies.

### Boilerplate Workflow Code {#boilerplate-workflow-code}

In the Temporal Java SDK programming model, a [Workflow Definition](/workflows#workflow-definition) is defined as an interface and its implementation.

#### Boilerplate Workflow Interface {#workflow-code}

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/main/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow.java. -->

The `BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow` interface below is an example of a the first part of a Workflow Definition.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/main/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow.java) in the context of the rest of the application code.

:::

```java
import io.temporal.workflow.WorkflowInterface;
import io.temporal.workflow.WorkflowMethod;


// Workflow Interfaces must be annotated with @WorkflowInterface
@WorkflowInterface
public interface BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow {

  // The Workflow Method within the interface must be annotated with @WorkflowMethod
  @WorkflowMethod
  public String backgroundCheck(String socialSecurityNumber);

}
```

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/main/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow.java. -->

To designate an interface as a Workflow, annotate the interface declaration
with `@WorkflowInterface`. Then designate a method within the interface
as the Workflow Method by annotating its method signature with `@WorkflowMethod`.
The Workflow Method is the method that will be invoked when executing a Workflow.
There can only be one Workflow Method per Workflow Definition.

#### Boilerplate Workflow Implementation {#workflow-code}

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/main/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowImpl.java. -->

Now that you've defined your Workflow Interface you can define its implementation.

:::

```java
import io.temporal.activity.ActivityOptions;
import io.temporal.workflow.Workflow;

import java.time.Duration;


public class BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowImpl implements BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow {

  // Define the Activity Execution options
  // StartToCloseTimeout or ScheduleToCloseTimeout must be set
  ActivityOptions options = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
          .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
          .build();

  // Create an client stub to activities that implement the given interface
  private final BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivities activities =
      Workflow.newActivityStub(BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivities.class, options);

  @Override
  public String backgroundCheck(String socialSecurityNumber) {
    String ssnTraceResult = activities.ssnTraceActivity(socialSecurityNumber);
    return ssnTraceResult;
  }

}
```

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/main/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowImpl.java. -->

You define your Workflow Implementation by defining a class that `implements` the
Workflow Interface.

To have a Workflow call Activities, you'll instantiate an object representing
those Activities. There are various options that can be passed in during creation
time, but Temporal requires that you set _either_ `StartToCloseTimeout` or `ScheduleToCloseTimeout`
when creating your Activities stub. You can read more about these options [in our documentation](/activities#start-to-close-timeout)

As with regular Java methods, Workflow Methods support the passing of parameters.
However, all Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable (using the Jackson JSON
Payload Converter).

To request the execution of an Activity, also referred to as an [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution),
call the Activity Method from within the Workflow Method. Use the `activities`
object that was created in the Workflow Definition to call the Activity Method
along with the any parameters that need to be passed.

A Java-based Workflow Definition can return any serializable output, or raise an
exception if one was encountered.
We get into the best practices around Workflow parameters, return values, and
exceptions in the one of the next sections.

In regards to code organization, we recommend organizing Workflow code the same
way you'd organize your standard Java code.

### Boilerplate Activity Code {#boilerplate-activity-code}

In the Temporal Java SDK programming model, an Activity is defined as an interface and its implementation.

#### Boilerplate Activity Interface {#activity-code}

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.

:::

```java
import io.temporal.activity.ActivityInterface;


// Activity Interfaces must be annotated with @ActivityInterface
@ActivityInterface
// BackgroundCheckActivities is the interface that contains your Activity Definitions
public interface BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivities {

  // ssnTraceActivity is your custom Activity Definition
  public String ssnTraceActivity(String socialSecurityNumber);

}
```

To designate an interface as a Activity, annotate the interface declaration
with `@ActivityInterface`. Then designate a method within the interface
as the Activity Method by annotating its method signature with `@ActivityMethod`.
The Activity Method is the method that will be invoked when executing a specificy
Activity. There can multiple Activity Methods per Activity Definition.

#### Boilerplate Activity Implementation {#activity-code}

public class BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl implements BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivities{

  @Override
  public String ssnTraceActivity(String socialSecurityNumber){
    
    // This is where a call to another service would be made to perform the trace
    // We are simulating that the service that does SSNTrace executed successfully
    // with a passing value being returned

    String result = "pass";
    return result;
  }

In regards to code organization, we recommend organizing Activity code the same
way you'd organize your standard Java code.

### Run your Workflow and Activities using a Worker {#run-workers}

Now that you've written a Workflow and an Activity, it is time to run a Worker
to execute your code. The Worker itself is provided by the Temporal SDK, but your
application will include code to configure and run it. When that code executes,
the Worker establishes a persistent connection to the Temporal Cluster and begins
polling a Task Queue on the Cluster, seeking work to perform.

Since Workers execute your code, any Workflows or Activities you invoke will make
no progress unless at least one Worker is running.

#### Run a dev server Worker {#dev-server-worker}

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/main/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/workers/DevServerWorker.java. -->

To run a Worker Process with a local development server, define the following steps in code:

- Generate the gRPC stubs necessary to configure a connection to a Temporal Cluster running on localhost using the 'default' namespace
- Initialize a Temporal Client (`WorkflowClient`), passing in the gRPC stubs.
- Initialize a WorkerFactory, passing in the Temporal Client (`WorkflowClient`)
- Create a new Worker using the WorkerFactory, passing in the task queue the Worker should listen on.
- Register the application's Workflow and Activities.
- Call start on the Worker.

Temporal recommends keeping Worker code separate from Workflow and Activity code.

When specifying the Temporal Cloud Namespace, make sure to append the Account Id
as it appears in the url of the Cloud UI.

Consider the following Namespace url: https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces/backgroundcheck-app.1a23b/workflows,
if your Namespace is "backgroundcheck-app" and your Account Id is "1a23b", then
you would specify your Namespace as "backgroundcheck-app.1a23b".

The Temporal Cloud gRPC connection address includes your
[Namesapce](/namespaces#) and a port number: `<Namespace>.<AccountId>.tmprl.cloud:<port>`.
For example: `https://backgroundcheck-app.1a23b.tmprl.cloud:1234`.
There is an option to copy the grPC endpoint address from the Temporal Cloud UI.

#### Run a Self-hosted Worker {#dockerfile}

To deploy a self-hosted Worker to your Docker environment, you need to configure your Worker with the appropriate IP address and port.

##### Confirm network

The default `docker-compose.yml` file in the `temporalio/docker-compose` repo has the Temporal Server exposed on port 7233 on the `temporal-network`.

```yml
services:
  # ...
  temporal:
    container_name: temporal
    # ...
    networks:
      - temporal-network
    ports:
      - 7233:7233
    # ...
  # ...
```

If you are using a different or customized docker compose file, you can see the available networks by using the following command:

```shell
docker network ls
```

##### Confirm IP address

Get the IP address of the Docker network that the containers are using.

To do that, first inspect the network:

```shell
docker network inspect temporal-network
```

Look for the container named `temporal`.

Example output:

```json
[
  {
    "Name": "temporal-network",
    // ...
    "Containers": {
      // ...
      "53cf62f0cc6cfd2a9627a2b5a4c9f48ffe5a858f0ef7b2eaa51bf7ea8fd0e86f": {
        "Name": "temporal",
        // ...
        "IPv4Address": "172.18.0.4/16"
        // ...
      }
      // ...
    }
    // ...
  }
]
```

Copy the IP address part.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/main/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/workers/SelfHostedWorker.java. -->

Set IP address and port in the Service Stubs Options and the Namespace in the
Temporal Client options.

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.
The code sample might be abridged within the guide to highlight key aspects.
Visit the source repository to [view the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/main/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/workers/SelfHostedWorker.java) in the context of the rest of the application code.

```java
import backgroundcheckboilerplate.BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl;

import io.temporal.client.WorkflowClient;
import io.temporal.client.WorkflowClientOptions;
import io.temporal.serviceclient.WorkflowServiceStubs;
import io.temporal.serviceclient.WorkflowServiceStubsOptions;
import io.temporal.worker.Worker;
import io.temporal.worker.WorkerFactory;


public class SelfHostedWorker {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Specify the IP address and port for the Service Stubs options
    WorkflowServiceStubsOptions stubsOptions = WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder()
            .setTarget("mycluster.example.com:7233")

    // Initialize a WorkerFactory, passing in the Temporal Client (WorkflowClient)
    WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);

    // Create a new Worker
    Worker worker = factory.newWorker("backgroundcheck-tasks");

    // Register the Workflow by passing in the class to the worker
    worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowImpl.class);

    // Register the Activities by passing in an Activities object used for execution
    worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesImpl());

    // Start the Worker
    factory.start();
  }
}
```

Add a Docker file to the root of your Background Check application project.

Name the file `dockerfile`, with no extensions, and add the following configuration:

```dockerfile
# Use an official image of OpenJDK as the base image
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Maven project files to the container
COPY src src/
COPY pom.xml .

# Build the Maven project to a JAR file
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y maven && \
    mvn clean compile

# Set the entry point for the application
CMD ["mvn", "exec:java", "-Dexec.mainClass='backgroundcheck.workers.SelfHostedWorker']
```

:::info

Make sure the Java version matches the one you used when developing your
application and is version `1.8` or greater.

:::

Then build the Docker image using the following command:

```shell
docker build . -t backgroundcheck-worker-image:latest
```

Now run the Worker on the same network as the Temporal Cluster containers using the following command:

```shell
docker run --network temporal-network backgroundcheck-worker-image:latest
```

## Start Workflow using the CLI {#start-workflow}

You can use the Temporal CLI to start a Workflow whether you are using a local development server, Temporal Cloud, or are in a self-hosted environment.
However, you need to provide additional options to the command when operating with the Temporal Cloud or self-hosted environments.

### Local dev Server

#### Starting the Workflow with Temporal CLI

Use the Temporal CLI `temporal workflow start` command to start your Workflow.

```shell
temporal workflow start \
 --task-queue backgroundcheck-boilerplate-task-queue \
 --type BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow \
 --input '"555-55-5555"' \
 --namespace backgroundcheck_namespace
```

For more details, see the [temporal workflow start](/cli/workflow#start) command API reference.

After you start the Workflow, you can see it in the Temporal Platform.
Use the Temporal CLI or the Temporal Web UI to monitor the Workflow's progress.

#### List Workflows

Use the 'temporal workflow list` command to list all of the Workflows in the Namespace:

```shell
temporal workflow list \
 --namespace backgroundcheck_namespace
```

#### View in Web UI

You can also use the Web UI to see the Workflows associated with the Namespace.

The local development server starts the Web UI at [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233).

When you visit for the first time, the Web UI directs you to [http://localhost:8233/namespaces/default/workflows](http://localhost:8233/namespaces/default/workflows).

Use the Namespace dropdown to select the project Namespace you created earlier.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Web UI Namespace selection</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/img/web-ui-namespace-selection.png" alt="Web UI Namespace selection" height="1402" width="3004" /></div></div>

You should now be at [http://localhost:8233/namespaces/backgroundcheck_namespace/workflows](http://localhost:8233/namespaces/backgroundcheck_namespace/workflows).

### Temporal Cloud

#### Starting the Workflow with Temporal CLI

Run the `temporal workflow start` command, and make sure to specify the certificate and private key arguments.

```shell
temporal workflow start \
 --task-queue backgroundcheck-boilerplate-task-queue-cloud \
 --type BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow \
 --tls-cert-path ca.pem \
 --tls-key-path ca.key \
 --input '"555-55-5555"' \
 --namespace <namespace>.<account-id> \
 --address <namespace>.<account-id>.tmprl.cloud:<port>
```

Make sure that the certificate path, private key path, Namespace, and address argument values match your project.

:::info Use environment variables

Use environment variables as a way to quickly switch between a local dev server and Temporal Cloud, for example.

You can customize the environment names to be anything you want.

```shell
# set Cloud env variables
temporal env set cloud.namespace <namespace>.<account-id>
temporal env set cloud.address <namespace>.<account-id>.tmprl.cloud:<port>
temporal env set cloud.tls-cert-path ca.pem
temporal env set cloud.tls-key-path ca.key
# set local env variables
temporal env set local.namespace <namespace>
```

In this way, you can just provide a single `--env` command option when using the CLI rather than specifying each connection option in every command.

```shell
temporal workflow start \
 # ...
 --env cloud \
 # ...
```

:::

#### List Workflows

Run the `temporal workflow list` command, and make sure to specify the certificate and private key arguments.

```shell
temporal workflow list \
 --tls-cert-path ca.pem \
 --tls-key-path ca.key \
 --namespace <namespace>.<account-id> \
 --address <namespace>.<account-id>.tmprl.cloud:<port>
```

#### View in Web UI

Visit the Workflows page of your Cloud Namespace.
The URL will look something like the following:

```text
https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces/<namespace>.<account-id>/workflows
```

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">View Workflows in the Cloud UI</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/img/cloud-view-workflows.png" alt="View Workflows in the Cloud UI" height="578" width="2578" /></div></div>

### Self-hosted

#### Starting the Workflow with Temporal CLI

Use your Temporal CLI alias to run the `temporal workflow start` command and start your Workflow.

```shell
temporal_docker workflow start \
 --task-queue backgroundcheck-boilerplate-task-queue-self-hosted \
 --type BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflow \
 --input '"555-55-5555"' \
 --namespace backgroundcheck_namespace
```

#### List Workflows

Using your Temporal CLI alias, run the `temporal workflow list` command.
This command lists the Workflows Executions within the Namespace:

```shell
temporal_docker workflow list \
 --namespace backgroundcheck_namespace
```

#### View in the Web UI

When you visit for the first time, the Web UI directs you to [http://localhost:8233/namespaces/default/workflows](http://localhost:8080/namespaces/default/workflows).

Use the Namespace dropdown to select the project Namespace you created earlier.

You should now be at [http://localhost:8080/namespaces/backgroundcheck_namespace/workflows](http://localhost:8080/namespaces/backgroundcheck_namespace/workflows).

## Add a testing framework {#test-framework}

The Temporal Java SDK provides a test framework to facilitate Workflow unit and integration testing.
The test framework provides the `TestWorkflowEnvironment` and `TestActivityEnvironment` classes which includes an in-memory implementation
of the Temporal service that supports automatic time skipping. This allows you to
easily test long-running Workflows in seconds, without having to change your Workflow code.

You can use the provided testing environments with a Java unit testing framework
of your choice, such as JUnit. This guide will use JUnit 5.

### Setup testing dependencies

To start using the Java SDK test framework, you need to add [`io.temporal:temporal-testing`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.temporal/temporal-testing)
as a dependency to your project:

**[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)**:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.temporal</groupId>
    <artifactId>temporal-testing</artifactId>
    <version>1.20.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
    <version>5.5.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
    <artifactId>mockito-junit-jupiter</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
    <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

**[Gradle Groovy DSL](https://gradle.org/)**:

```groovy
testImplementation group: 'io.temporal', name: 'temporal-testing', version: '1.20.1'
testImplementation group: 'junit', name: 'junit-jupiter', version: '5.5.2'
testImplementation group: 'org.mockito', name: 'mockito-core', version: '5.1.1'
testImplementation group: 'org.mockito', name: 'mockito-junit-jupiter', version: '5.3.1'
```

Make sure to set the version that matches your dependency version of the [Temporal Java SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java).

### Testing Activities {#test-framework}

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/test/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesTest.java. -->

Temporal provides the `TestActivityEnvironment` and `TestActivityExtension` classes
to allow for testing Activities outside the scope of a Workflow. Testing
Activities is similar to testing non-Temporal java code.

Some examples of things an Activity can be tested for are:

- Exceptions thrown when invoking the Activity Execution.
- Exceptions thrown when checking for the result of the Activity Execution.
- Activity return values. Check to ensure the return value is expected.

This example asserts that the expected value was returned by the invocation of the Activity.

  // Test the Activity in isolation from the Workflow
  @Test
  public void testSsnTraceActivity(BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivities activities) {
    String socialSecurityNumber = "111-22-3333";

    // Run the Activity in the test environment
    String result = activities.ssnTraceActivity(socialSecurityNumber);

    // Check for the expected return value
    assertEquals("pass", result);

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/test/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateActivitiesTest.java. -->

Temporal provides the `TestActivityExtension` class to simplify the creation of
the test environment. Using this extension you provide your Activity
to register with a Worker created by the testing framework to be used during testing.
The extension provides a a stubbed Activity object to each test as well as
manage the lifecycle of the test environment.
If you require more granular control of the test environments, you can manually create
and destroy all these parts in methods annotated with `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach`
as defined by JUnit.

You annotate the method with @Test and test the results of the Activity via assertions.

### Testing Workflows {#test-framework-details}

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/test/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowTest.java. -->

Temporal provides the `TestWorkflowEnvironment` and `TestWorkflowExtension` classes
to allow for testing Workflows. There are two ways to test Workflows; the first
is to test the Workflow code without invoking the real Activities by mocking
the Workflow's Activities and the second is to test the Workflow and its Activities
in their entirety. This section will focus on the first scenario while a following
section will cover the later.

Testing your Workflows without invoking your Activities can be useful for testing
Workflow specific logic without having to worry about the Activity invocation
producing a side-effect or having any Activity downstream dependency, such as a
microservice, be available during the duration of your testing.

As for the actual testing code, testing Workflows is similar to testing non-Temporal java code.

Some examples of things an Workflow can be tested for are:

- Exceptions thrown when invoking the Workflow Execution.
- Exceptions thrown when checking for the result of the Workflow Execution.
- Workflow return values. Check to ensure the return value is expected.

We can also perform a Workflow Replay test, and we'll provide detailed coverage of this topic in another section.

THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-java/blob/main/backgroundcheck/src/test/java/backgroundcheckboilerplate/BackgroundCheckBoilerplateWorkflowTest.java. -->

As for the code, first you register your Workflow with the `TestWorkflowExtension`.
This extension allows you to pass in a `TestWorklowEnvironment`, `Worker`, and
an instance of your Workflow into your tests. To test your Workflow using mocked
activities you then create a mocked object of your Activity class to be used for
testing. Then you mock the Activity method, in this case `ssNTraceAcvitity`, so
that when when a specific value is passed to the Activity it returns a specific result.
Then the mocked object is used to register the mocked Activities with the Worker
being used in the test environment. Then you start the test environment, invoke
your Workflow as usual, passing in the specific value for your Activity so that
the Activity returns the result you are expecting. Then you assert that the
results are what you expected.

Doiong this allows you to test the Workflow code without having to worry
about actually invoking the Activity.

This example tests a complete Workflow by invoking the Activities the Workflow
calls. This is, in reality, an integration test. Integration testing is useful
for ensuring the complete success of your entire Workflow. However, note that
any downstream dependencies of the Activities, such as microservice or databases,
must be online for the testing. Furthermore, any mutations the Activity would typically
perform as part of its regular execution will be performed as part of testing.
We recommend either having an entirely separate testing environment for testing
your Workflows, or testing your Workflow and Activity code in isolation, as
detailed in prior sections in this guide.

As for the code, first you register your Workflow with the `TestWorkflowExtension`.
This extension allows you to pass in a `TestWorkflowEnvironment`, `Worker`, and
an instance of your Workflow into your tests. From there you register your Activities
with the Worker, start the test environment, and invoke your Workflow as you would
typically. Then you assert that the results are what you expected.
