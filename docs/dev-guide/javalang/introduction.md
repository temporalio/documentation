Welcome to Temporal Java SDK developer’s guide!

:::success Temporal Java SDK API reference

https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/index.html

Short link: https://t.mp/java-api

:::

The open source [Temporal Java SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java) alpha version first released on March 28, 2020 and has been enabling Java developers to build Temporal Applications ever since.

The Temporal Java SDK developers guide documents the concepts, features, and tools that you’ll use to create, test, and execute Temporal applications in Java.

The Java SDK and it contributors have crafted a developer experience that aims to combine and provide both the benefits of the Temporal programming model and idiomatic Java programming paradigms.

### Supported runtimes

**What are the supported Java runtimes?**

Developing applications with the Temporal Java SDK requires Java 1.8+.

### Build configuration

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/663f6d1be81be6700c28c242b35905f20b68c4fda7b2c7c4e3.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/temporal/java-sdk-public) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/temporalio/sdk-java/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/temporalio/sdk-java?branch=master)

**Where can I get a build configuration?**

[Find the latest release](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.temporal/temporal-sdk) of the Temporal Java SDK at Maven Central.

Add _`temporal-sdk`_ as a dependency to your _`pom.xml`_:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.temporal</groupId>
  <artifactId>temporal-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>N.N.N</version>
</dependency>
```

or to _`build.gradle`_:

```
compile group: 'io.temporal', name: 'temporal-sdk', version: 'N.N.N'
```

### Expected skills and experiences

**What Java programming skills and experiences should a developer have to succeed with the Java SDK?**

The Temporal Platform enables developers to build a wide range of applications that serve a wide range of use cases.

We recommend that developers are equipped with at least a moderate level of experience in practicing the following skills to develop production-level Temporal Applications:

:::success Recommended

**Core fundamentals:**

- Java Syntax and Structure
- Data Types
- Operators
- Control Statements: loops, conditionals
- Basic Input/Output
- Understanding of Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

**Object-oriented programming:**

- Classes and Objects
- Interfaces
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

**Java language features:**

- Annotations
- Exception handling
- Collections Framework
- Java Stream API
- Lambdas and Functional Interfaces
- Threads and concurrency

:::

:::info Nice to have

**Tools**

We recommend that developers have a beginner to moderate level of experience using a Java IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

**Testing**

We recommend that developers have some experience with a testing library and framework such as JUnit or Mockito.

**Code base version control**

We recommend that developers have some experience using a version control system, such as Git.

**Dependency management**

We recommend that developers have some experience using a dependency management system such as Maven or Gradle.

**Listing and sorting**

We recommend that developers have some experience with SQL-like syntax and CRUD operational concepts to make use of Temporal’s Visibility tools.

**Security**

To onboard with Temporal Cloud or set up a Self-Hosted Cluster, we recommend that developers have some understanding and experience with TLS, security certificates, and private keys.

**Privacy**

For applications that process any amount of user data we recommend that developers have some understanding and experience with PII and sensitive information encryption.

:::caution Complex and large scale use cases
**Large scale use cases**

For complex and large-scale use cases, having at least some experience with a variation of the following could be helpful:

- Deeper JVM understanding of the following:
  - Memory Management
  - Garbage Collection
  - JIT Compilation
- Design Patterns:
  - Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.
- Distributed system architectures
  - Event-driven architectures: Understanding of how events can drive processes and how they fit into Workflows.
  - Stateful vs. stateless processes: Knowledge about the advantages and pitfalls of both.
  - Scalability: Understanding the implications, of scaling services, on performance and reliability.
  - Fault tolerance: Knowledge of supervisor systems that check progress and resume after suspensions.
