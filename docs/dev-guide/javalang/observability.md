This section covers features related to viewing the state of the application, including:

- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [Tracing](#tracing)
- [Logging](#logging)
- [Visibility](#visibility)

## How to emit metrics {#metrics}

Each Temporal SDK is capable of emitting an optional set of metrics from either the Client or the Worker process.
For a complete list of metrics capable of being emitted, see the <a class="tdlp" href="/references/sdk-metrics#">SDK metrics reference<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">SDK metrics</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The Temporal SDKs emit metrics from Temporal Client usage and Worker Processes.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/references/sdk-metrics#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Metrics can be scraped and stored in time series databases, such as:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
- [M3db](https://m3db.io/docs/)
- [statsd](https://github.com/statsd/statsd)

Temporal also provides a dashboard you can integrate with graphing services like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/). For more information, see:

- Temporal's implementation of the [Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards)
- [How to export metrics in Grafana](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts#exploring-metrics-via-grafana)

To emit metrics with the Java SDK, use the[`MicrometerClientStatsReporter`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/55ee7894aec427d7e384c3519732bdd61119961a/src/main/java/io/temporal/common/reporter/MicrometerClientStatsReporter.java#L34) class to integrate with Micrometer MeterRegistry configured for your metrics backend.
[Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/docs) is a popular Java framework that provides integration with Prometheus and other backends.

The following example shows how to use `MicrometerClientStatsReporter` to define the metrics scope and set it with the `WorkflowServiceStubsOptions`.

```java
//...
   // see the Micrometer documentation for configuration details on other supported monitoring systems.
   // in this example shows how to set up Prometheus registry and stats reported.
   PrometheusMeterRegistry registry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry(PrometheusConfig.DEFAULT);
   StatsReporter reporter = new MicrometerClientStatsReporter(registry);
    // set up a new scope, report every 10 seconds
     Scope scope = new RootScopeBuilder()
             .reporter(reporter)
             .reportEvery(com.uber.m3.util.Duration.ofSeconds(10));
   // for Prometheus collection, expose a scrape endpoint.
   //...
   // add metrics scope to WorkflowServiceStub options
   WorkflowServiceStubsOptions stubOptions =
       WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder().setMetricsScope(scope).build();
//...
```

For more details, see the [Java SDK Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/tree/main/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/metrics).
For details on configuring a Prometheus scrape endpoint with Micrometer, see the [Micrometer Prometheus Configuring](https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/prometheus#_configuring) documentation.

## How to setup Tracing {#tracing}

Tracing allows you to view the call graph of a Workflow along with its Activities and any Child Workflows.

Temporal Web's tracing capabilities mainly track Activity Execution within a Temporal context. If you need custom tracing specific for your use case, you should make use of context propagation to add tracing logic accordingly.

For information about Workflow tracing, see [Tracing Temporal Workflows with DataDog](https://spiralscout.com/blog/tracing-temporal-workflow-with-datadog).

For information about how to configure exporters and instrument your code, see [Tracing Temporal Services with OTEL](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/develop/docs/tracing.md).

To configure tracing in Java, register the `OpenTracingClientInterceptor()` interceptor.
You can register the interceptors on both the Temporal Client side and the Worker side.

The following code examples demonstrate the `OpenTracingClientInterceptor()` on the Temporal Client.

```java
WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder()
   //...
   .setInterceptors(new OpenTracingClientInterceptor())
   .build();
```

```java
WorkflowClientOptions clientOptions =
    WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder()
        .setInterceptors(new OpenTracingClientInterceptor(JaegerUtils.getJaegerOptions(type)))
        .build();
WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service, clientOptions);
```

The following code examples demonstrate the `OpenTracingClientInterceptor()` on the Worker.

```java
WorkerFactoryOptions.newBuilder()
   //...
   .setWorkerInterceptors(new OpenTracingWorkerInterceptor())
   .build();
```

```java
WorkerFactoryOptions factoryOptions =
    WorkerFactoryOptions.newBuilder()
        .setWorkerInterceptors(
            new OpenTracingWorkerInterceptor(JaegerUtils.getJaegerOptions(type)))
        .build();
WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client, factoryOptions);
```

For more information, see the Temporal [OpenTracing module](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-opentracing/README.md).

## How to log from a Workflow {#logging}

Send logs and errors to a logging service, so that when things go wrong, you can see what happened.

The SDK core uses `WARN` for its default logging level.

To get a standard `slf4j` logger in your Workflow code, use the [`Workflow.getLogger`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/workflow/Workflow.html) method.

```java
private static final Logger logger = Workflow.getLogger(DynamicDslWorkflow.class);
```

Logs in replay mode are omitted unless the [`WorkerFactoryOptions.Builder.setEnableLoggingInReplay(boolean)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/worker/WorkerFactoryOptions.Builder.html#setEnableLoggingInReplay(boolean)) method is set to true.

### How to provide a custom logger {#custom-logger}

Use a custom logger for logging.

To set a custom logger, supply your own logging implementation and configuration details the same way you would in any other Java application.

## How to use Visibility APIs {#visibility}

The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.

### How to use Search Attributes {#search-attributes}

The typical method of retrieving a Workflow Execution is by its Workflow Id.

However, sometimes you'll want to retrieve one or more Workflow Executions based on another property. For example, imagine you want to get all Workflow Executions of a certain type that have failed within a time range, so that you can start new ones with the same arguments.

You can do this with <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#search-attribute">Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#search-attribute">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#default-search-attributes">Default Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#default-search-attributes">Learn more</a></span></span></a> like `WorkflowType`, `StartTime` and `ExecutionStatus` are automatically added to Workflow Executions.
- _Custom Search Attributes_ can contain their own domain-specific data (like `customerId` or `numItems`).
  - A few <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#custom-search-attributes">generic Custom Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#custom-search-attributes">Learn more</a></span></span></a> like `CustomKeywordField` and `CustomIntField` are created by default in Temporal's [Docker Compose](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#docker-compose).

The steps to using custom Search Attributes are:

- Create a new Search Attribute in your Cluster using `tctl search-attribute create` or the Cloud UI.
- Set the value of the Search Attribute for a Workflow Execution:
  - On the Client by including it as an option when starting the Execution.
  - In the Workflow by calling `UpsertSearchAttributes`.
- Read the value of the Search Attribute:
  - On the Client by calling `DescribeWorkflow`.
  - In the Workflow by looking at `WorkflowInfo`.
- Query Workflow Executions by the Search Attribute using a <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a>:
  - <a class="tdlp" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">In `tctl`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">tctl workflow list</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">How to list open or closed Workflow Executions using tctl.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
  - In code by calling `ListWorkflowExecutions`.

Here is how to query Workflow Executions:

### How to set custom Search Attributes {#custom-search-attributes}

After you've created custom Search Attributes in your Cluster (using `tctl search-attribute create`or the Cloud UI), you can set the values of the custom Search Attributes when starting a Workflow.

To set a custom Search Attribute, call the [`setSearchAttributes()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/client/WorkflowOptions.Builder.html#setSearchAttributes(java.util.Map)) method.

```java
WorkflowOptions workflowOptions =
    WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
        .setSearchAttributes(generateSearchAttributes())
        .build();
```

`generateSearchAttributes()` is a `Map<String, ?>` from the Search Attribute used as the key to a value of one of the following types.

- `String`
- `Long`
- `Integer`
- `Boolean`
- `Double`
- `OffsetDateTime`

### How to upsert Search Attributes {#upsert-search-attributes}

You can upsert Search Attributes to add or update Search Attributes from within Workflow code.

In your Workflow code, call the [`upsertSearchAttributes(Map<String, ?> searchAttributes)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/workflow/Workflow.html#upsertSearchAttributes(java.util.Map)) method.

```java
 Map<String, Object> attr1 = new HashMap<>();
     attr1.put("CustomIntField", 1);
     attr1.put("CustomBoolField", true);
     Workflow.upsertSearchAttributes(attr1);

     Map<String, Object> attr2 = new HashMap<>();
     attr2.put("CustomIntField", Lists.newArrayList(1, 2));
     attr2.put("CustomKeywordField", "Seattle");
     Workflow.upsertSearchAttributes(attr2);
```

The results of `upsertSearchAttributes()` output the following search attributes.

```json
{
    "CustomIntField": 1, 2,
    "CustomBoolField": true,
    "CustomKeywordField": "Seattle",
  }
```

### How to remove a Search Attribute from a Workflow {#remove-search-attribute}

To remove a Search Attribute that was previously set, set it to an empty array: `[]`.

To remove a Search Attribute, call the `upsertSearchAttributes()` method and set it to an empty map.
