## Debug

### Debug in a development environment

In addition to the normal development tools of logging and a debugger, you can also see what’s happening in your Workflow by using the [Web UI](/web-ui) or [`tctl`](/tctl-v1).

### Debug in a development production

You can debug production Workflows using:

- [Web UI](/web-ui)
- [tctl](/tctl-v1)

You can debug and tune Worker performance with metrics and the [Worker performance guide](/dev-guide/worker-performance).
