## How to develop with Signals {#signals}

A [Signal](/workflows#signal) is a message sent to a running Workflow Execution.

Signals are defined in your code and handled in your Workflow Definition.
Signals can be sent to Workflow Executions from a Temporal Client or from another Workflow Execution.

### How to define a Signal {#define-signal}

A Signal has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Signal type, is a string.
- The arguments must be [serializable](/dataconversion#).

Workflows can answer synchronous [Queries](/workflows#query) and receive [Signals](/workflows#signal).

All interface methods must have one of the following annotations:

- **#[WorkflowMethod]** indicates an entry point to a Workflow.
  It contains parameters that specify timeouts and a Task Queue name.
  Required parameters (such as `executionStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds`) that are not specified through the annotation must be provided at runtime.
- **#[SignalMethod]** indicates a method that reacts to external signals. It must have a `void` return type.
- **#[QueryMethod]** indicates a method that reacts to synchronous query requests. It must have a non `void` return type.

> It is possible (though not recommended for usability reasons) to annotate concrete class implementation.

You can have more than one method with the same annotation (except #[WorkflowMethod]).

For example:

```php
use Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowInterface;
use Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowMethod;
use Temporal\Workflow\SignalMethod;
use Temporal\Workflow\QueryMethod;

#[WorkflowInterface]
interface FileProcessingWorkflow
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function processFile(Argument $args);

    #[QueryMethod("history")]
    public function getHistory(): array;

    #[QueryMethod("status")]
    public function getStatus(): string;

    #[SignalMethod]
    public function retryNow(): void;

    #[SignalMethod]
    public function abandon(): void;
}
```

Note that name parameter of Workflow method annotations can be used to specify name of Workflow, Signal and Query types.
If name is not specified the short name of the Workflow interface is used.

In the above code the `#[WorkflowMethod(name)]` is not specified, thus the Workflow Type defaults to `"FileProcessingWorkflow"`.

### How to handle a Signal {#handle-signal}

Workflows listen for Signals by the Signal's name.

Use the `#[SignalMethod]` annotation to handle Signals in the Workflow interface:

```php
use Temporal\Workflow;

#[Workflow\WorkflowInterface]
class YourWorkflow
{
    private bool $value;

    #[Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
    public function run()
    {
        yield Workflow::await(fn()=> $this->value);
        return 'OK';
    }

    #[Workflow\SignalMethod]
    public function setValue(bool $value)
    {
        $this->value = $value;
    }
}
```

In the preceding example, the Workflow updates the protected value.
The main Workflow coroutine waits for the value to change by using the `Workflow::await()` function.

### How to send a Signal from a Temporal Client {#send-signal-from-client}

When a Signal is sent successfully from the Temporal Client, the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.

To send a Signal to a Workflow Execution from a Client, call the Signal method, annotated with `#[SignalMethod]` in the Workflow interface, from the Client code.

To send a Signal to a Workflow, use `WorkflowClient->newWorkflowStub` or `WorkflowClient->newUntypedWorkflowStub`:

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow::class);

$run = $workflowClient->start($workflow);

// do something

$workflow->setValue(true);

assert($run->getValue() === true);
```

Use `WorkflowClient->newRunningWorkflowStub` or `WorkflowClient->newUntypedRunningWorkflowStub` with Workflow Id to send Signals to already running Workflows.

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newRunningWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow::class, 'workflowID');
$workflow->setValue(true);
```

See [Handle Signal](#handle-signal) for details on how to handle Signals in a Workflow.

### How to send a Signal from a Workflow {#send-signal-from-workflow}

A Workflow can send a Signal to another Workflow, in which case it's called an _External Signal_.

When an External Signal is sent:

- A [SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated) Event appears in the sender's Event History.
- A [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the recipient's Event History.

To send Signal to a Workflow use `WorkflowClient`->`newWorkflowStub` or `WorkflowClient`->`newUntypedWorkflowStub`:

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow::class);

$run = $workflowClient->start($workflow);

// do something

$workflow->setValue(true);

assert($run->getValue() === true);
```

Use `WorkflowClient`->`newRunningWorkflowStub` or `WorkflowClient->newUntypedRunningWorkflowStub` with Workflow Id to send
Signals to a running Workflow.

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newRunningWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow::class, 'workflowID');
$workflow->setValue(true);
```

### How to Signal-With-Start {#signal-with-start}

Signal-With-Start is used from the Client.
It takes a Workflow Id, Workflow arguments, a Signal name, and Signal arguments.

If there's a Workflow running with the given Workflow Id, it will be signaled. If there isn't, a new Workflow will be started and immediately signaled.

In cases where you may not know if a Workflow is running, and want to send a Signal to it, use `startwithSignal`.
If a running Workflow exists, the `startwithSignal` API sends the Signal.
If there is no running Workflow, the API starts a new Workflow Run and delivers the Signal to it.

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(YourWorkflow::class);

$run = $workflowClient->startWithSignal(
    $workflow,
    'setValue',
    [true], // signal arguments
    [] // start arguments
);
```

## How to develop with Queries {#queries}

A [Query](/workflows#query) is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.

### How to define a Query {#define-query}

A Query has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Query type, is a string.
- The arguments must be [serializable](/dataconversion#).

Workflows can answer synchronous [Queries](/workflows#query) and receive [Signals](/workflows#signal).

All interface methods must have one of the following annotations:

- **#[WorkflowMethod]** indicates an entry point to a Workflow.
  It contains parameters that specify timeouts and a Task Queue name.
  Required parameters (such as `executionStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds`) that are not specified through the annotation must be provided at runtime.
- **#[SignalMethod]** indicates a method that reacts to external signals. It must have a `void` return type.
- **#[QueryMethod]** indicates a method that reacts to synchronous query requests. It must have a non `void` return type.

> It is possible (though not recommended for usability reasons) to annotate concrete class implementation.

You can have more than one method with the same annotation (except #[WorkflowMethod]).

For example:

```php
use Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowInterface;
use Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowMethod;
use Temporal\Workflow\SignalMethod;
use Temporal\Workflow\QueryMethod;

#[WorkflowInterface]
interface FileProcessingWorkflow
{
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function processFile(Argument $args);

    #[QueryMethod("history")]
    public function getHistory(): array;

    #[QueryMethod("status")]
    public function getStatus(): string;

    #[SignalMethod]
    public function retryNow(): void;

    #[SignalMethod]
    public function abandon(): void;
}
```

Note that name parameter of Workflow method annotations can be used to specify name of Workflow, Signal and Query types.
If name is not specified the short name of the Workflow interface is used.

In the above code the `#[WorkflowMethod(name)]` is not specified, thus the Workflow Type defaults to `"FileProcessingWorkflow"`.

### How to handle a Query {#handle-query}

Queries are handled by your Workflow.

Don’t include any logic that causes [Command](/workflows#command) generation within a Query handler (such as executing Activities).
Including such logic causes unexpected behavior.

You can add custom Query types to handle Queries such as Querying the current state of a
Workflow, or Querying how many Activities the Workflow has completed. To do this, you need to set
up a Query handler using method attribute `QueryMethod` or `Workflow::registerQueryHandler`.

```php
#[Workflow\WorkflowInterface]
class YourWorkflow
{
    #[Workflow\QueryMethod]
    public function getValue()
    {
        return 42;
    }

    #[Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
    public function run()
    {
        // workflow code
    }

}
```

The handler function can receive any number of input parameters, but all input parameters must be
serializable. The following sample code sets up a Query handler that handles the Query type of
`currentState`:

```php
#[Workflow\WorkflowInterface]
class YourWorkflow
{
    private string $currentState;

    #[Workflow\QueryMethod('current_state')]
    public function getCurrentState(): string
    {
        return $this->currentState;
    }

    #[Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
    public function run()
    {
        // Your normal Workflow code begins here, and you update the currentState
        // as the code makes progress.
        $this->currentState = 'waiting timer';
        try{
            yield Workflow::timer(DateInterval::createFromDateString('1 hour'));
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
            $this->currentState = 'timer failed';
            throw $e;
        }

        $yourActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
            YourActivityInterface::class,
            ActivityOptions::new()->withScheduleToStartTimeout(60)
        );

        $this->currentState = 'waiting activity';
        try{
            yield $yourActivity->doSomething('some input');
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
            $this->currentState = 'activity failed';
            throw $e;
        }

        $this->currentState = 'done';

        return null;
    }
}
```

You can also issue a Query from code using the `QueryWorkflow()` API on a Temporal Client object.

Use `WorkflowStub` to Query Workflow instances from your Client code (can be applied to both running and closed Workflows):

```php
$workflow = $workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    YourWorkflow::class,
    WorkflowOptions::new()
);

$workflowClient->start($workflow);

var_dump($workflow->getCurrentState());
sleep(60);
var_dump($workflow->getCurrentState());
```

### How to send a Query {#send-query}

Queries are sent from a Temporal Client.

## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when [starting the Workflow Execution](#workflow-timeouts).

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/workflows#workflow-execution-timeout)** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/workflows#workflow-run-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/workflows#workflow-task-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

Create an instance of `WorkflowOptions` in the Client code and set your timeout.

Available timeouts are:

- `withWorkflowExecutionTimeout()`
- `withWorkflowRunTimeout()`
- `withWorkflowTaskTimeout()`

```php
$workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    DynamicSleepWorkflowInterface::class,
    WorkflowOptions::new()
        ->withWorkflowId(DynamicSleepWorkflow::WORKFLOW_ID)
        ->withWorkflowIdReusePolicy(WorkflowIdReusePolicy::WORKFLOW_ID_REUSE_POLICY_ALLOW_DUPLICATE)
        // Set Workflow Timeout duration
        ->withWorkflowExecutionTimeout(CarbonInterval::minutes(2))
        // ->withWorkflowRunTimeout(CarbonInterval::minute(2))
        // ->withWorkflowTaskTimeout(CarbonInterval::minute(2))
);
```

### Workflow retries {#workflow-retries}

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/retry-policies#) to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

A Retry Policy can be configured with an instance of the `RetryOptions` object.
To enable retries for a Workflow, you need to provide a Retry Policy object via `ChildWorkflowOptions` for Child Workflows or via `WorkflowOptions` for top-level Workflows.

```php
$workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
      CronWorkflowInterface::class,
      WorkflowOptions::new()->withRetryOptions(
        RetryOptions::new()->withInitialInterval(120)
      )
);
```

## How to set Activity timeouts {#activity-timeouts}

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **[Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution).
- **[Start-To-Close Timeout](/activities#start-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum time allowed for a single [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution).
- **[Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/activities#schedule-to-start-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/workers#activity-task) is scheduled to when a [Worker](/workers#worker) starts that Activity Task.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

Because Activities are reentrant, only a single stub can be used for multiple Activity invocations.

Available timeouts are:

- withScheduleToCloseTimeout()
- withStartToCloseTimeout()
- withScheduleToStartTimeout()

```php
$this->greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    // Set Activity Timeout duration
    ActivityOptions::new()
        ->withScheduleToCloseTimeout(CarbonInterval::seconds(2))
        // ->withStartToCloseTimeout(CarbonInterval::seconds(2))
        // ->withScheduleToStartTimeout(CarbonInterval::seconds(10))
);
```

### How to set an Activity Retry Policy {#activity-retries}

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default [Retry Policy](/retry-policies#) if a custom one is not provided.

To set an Activity Retry, set `{@link RetryOptions}` on `{@link ActivityOptions}`.
The follow example creates a new Activity with the given options.

```php
$this->greetingActivity = Workflow::newActivityStub(
    GreetingActivityInterface::class,
    ActivityOptions::new()
        ->withScheduleToCloseTimeout(CarbonInterval::seconds(10))
        ->withRetryOptions(
            RetryOptions::new()
                ->withInitialInterval(CarbonInterval::seconds(1))
                ->withMaximumAttempts(5)
                ->withNonRetryableExceptions([\InvalidArgumentException::class])
        )
);
}
```

For an executable code sample, see [ActivityRetry sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/tree/master/app/src/ActivityRetry) in the PHP samples repository.

## How to Heartbeat an Activity {#activity-heartbeats}

An [Activity Heartbeat](/activities#activity-heartbeat) is a ping from the [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) that is executing the Activity to the [Temporal Cluster](/clusters#).
Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Cluster that the [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution) is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.
If the Cluster does not receive a Heartbeat within a [Heartbeat Timeout](/activities#heartbeat-timeout) time period, the Activity will be considered failed and another [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution) may be scheduled according to the Retry Policy.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Cluster—they may be [throttled](/activities#throttling) by the Worker.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Cluster when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Cluster.

Some Activities are long-running.
To react to a crash quickly, use the Heartbeat mechanism, `Activity::heartbeat()`, which lets the Temporal Server know that the Activity is still alive.
This acts as a periodic checkpoint mechanism for the progress of an Activity.

You can piggyback `details` on an Activity Heartbeat.
If an Activity times out, the last value of `details` is included in the `TimeoutFailure` delivered to a Workflow.
Then the Workflow can pass the details to the next Activity invocation.
Additionally, you can access the details from within an Activity via `Activity::getHeartbeatDetails`.
When an Activity is retried after a failure `getHeartbeatDetails` enables you to get the value from the last successful Heartbeat.

```php
use Temporal\Activity;

class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities
{
    // ...
    public function download(
        string $bucketName,
        string $remoteName,
        string $localName
    ): void
    {
        $this->dowloader->downloadWithProgress(
            $bucketName,
            $remoteName,
            $localName,
            // on progress
            function ($progress) {
                Activity::heartbeat($progress);
            }
        );

        Activity::heartbeat(100); // download complete

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

#### How to set a Heartbeat Timeout {#heartbeat-timeout}

A [Heartbeat Timeout](/activities#heartbeat-timeout) works in conjunction with [Activity Heartbeats](/activities#activity-heartbeat).

Some Activities are long-running.
To react to a crash quickly, use the Heartbeat mechanism, `Activity::heartbeat()`, which lets the Temporal Server know that the Activity is still alive.
This acts as a periodic checkpoint mechanism for the progress of an Activity.

You can piggyback `details` on an Activity Heartbeat.
If an Activity times out, the last value of `details` is included in the `TimeoutFailure` delivered to a Workflow.
Then the Workflow can pass the details to the next Activity invocation.
Additionally, you can access the details from within an Activity via `Activity::getHeartbeatDetails`.
When an Activity is retried after a failure `getHeartbeatDetails` enables you to get the value from the last successful Heartbeat.

```php
use Temporal\Activity;

class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities
{
    // ...
    public function download(
        string $bucketName,
        string $remoteName,
        string $localName
    ): void
    {
        $this->dowloader->downloadWithProgress(
            $bucketName,
            $remoteName,
            $localName,
            // on progress
            function ($progress) {
                Activity::heartbeat($progress);
            }
        );

        Activity::heartbeat(100); // download complete

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

## How to asynchronously complete an Activity {#asynchronous-activity-completion}

[Asynchronous Activity Completion](/activities#asynchronous-activity-completion) enables the Activity Function to return without the Activity Execution completing.

There are three steps to follow:

1. The Activity provides the external system with identifying information needed to complete the Activity Execution.
   Identifying information can be a [Task Token](/activities#task-token), or a combination of Namespace, Workflow Id, and Activity Id.
2. The Activity Function completes in a way that identifies it as waiting to be completed by an external system.
3. The Temporal Client is used to Heartbeat and complete the Activity.

Sometimes Workflows need to perform certain operations in parallel.

Invoking activity stub without the use of `yield` will return the Activity result promise which can be resolved at later moment.
Calling `yield` on promise blocks until a result is available.

> Activity promise also exposes `then` method to construct promise chains.
> Read more about Promises [here](https://github.com/reactphp/promise).

Alternatively you can explicitly wrap your code (including `yield` constucts) using `Workflow::async` which will execute nested code in parallel with main Workflow code.
Call `yeild` on Promise returned by `Workflow::async` to merge execution result back to primary Workflow method.

```php
public function greet(string $name): \Generator
{
    // Workflow::async runs it's activities and child workflows in a separate coroutine. Use keyword yield to merge
    // it back to parent process.

    $first = Workflow::async(
        function () use ($name) {
            $hello = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hello', $name);
            $bye = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Bye', $name);

            return $hello . '; ' . $bye;
        }
    );

    $second = Workflow::async(
        function () use ($name) {
            $hello = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Hola', $name);
            $bye = yield $this->greetingActivity->composeGreeting('Chao', $name);

            return $hello . '; ' . $bye;
        }
    );

    // blocks until $first and $second complete
    return (yield $first) . "\n" . (yield $second);
}
```

**Async completion**

There are certain scenarios when moving on from an Activity upon completion of its function is not possible or desirable.
For example, you might have an application that requires user input to complete the Activity.
You could implement the Activity with a polling mechanism, but a simpler and less resource-intensive implementation is to asynchronously complete a Temporal Activity.

There are two parts to implementing an asynchronously completed Activity:

1. The Activity provides the information necessary for completion from an external system and notifies the Temporal service that it is waiting for that outside callback.
2. The external service calls the Temporal service to complete the Activity.

The following example demonstrates the first part:

<!--SNIPSTART samples-php-async-activity-completion-activity-class-->

[app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/GreetingActivity.php](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/blob/master/app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/GreetingActivity.php)

```php
class GreetingActivity implements GreetingActivityInterface
{
    private LoggerInterface $logger;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->logger = new Logger();
    }
    /**
     * Demonstrates how to implement an Activity asynchronously.
     * When {@link Activity::doNotCompleteOnReturn()} is called,
     * the Activity implementation function that returns doesn't complete the Activity.
     */
    public function composeGreeting(string $greeting, string $name): string
    {
        // In real life this request can be executed anywhere. By a separate service for example.
        $this->logger->info(sprintf('GreetingActivity token: %s', base64_encode(Activity::getInfo()->taskToken)));
        // Send the taskToken to the external service that will complete the Activity.
        // Return from the Activity a function indicating that Temporal should wait
        // for an async completion message.
        Activity::doNotCompleteOnReturn();
        // When doNotCompleteOnReturn() is invoked the return value is ignored.
        return 'ignored';
    }
}
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

The following code demonstrates how to complete the Activity successfully using `WorkflowClient`:

<!--SNIPSTART samples-php-async-activity-completion-completebytoken-->

[app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/CompleteCommand.php](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/blob/master/app/src/AsyncActivityCompletion/CompleteCommand.php)

```php
$client = $this->workflowClient->newActivityCompletionClient();
// Complete the Activity.
$client->completeByToken(
    base64_decode($input->getArgument('token')),
    $input->getArgument('message')
);
```

<!--SNIPEND-->

To fail the Activity, you would do the following:

```php
// Fail the Activity.
$activityClient->completeExceptionallyByToken($taskToken, new \Error("activity failed"));
```

## Cancel an Activity from a Workflow {#cancel-an-activity}

Canceling an Activity from within a Workflow requires that the Activity Execution sends Heartbeats and sets a Heartbeat Timeout.
If the Heartbeat is not invoked, the Activity cannot receive a cancellation request.
When any non-immediate Activity is executed, the Activity Execution should send Heartbeats and set a [Heartbeat Timeout](/activities#heartbeat-timeout) to ensure that the server knows it is still working.

When an Activity is canceled, an error is raised in the Activity at the next available opportunity.
If cleanup logic needs to be performed, it can be done in a `finally` clause or inside a caught cancel error.
However, for the Activity to appear canceled the exception needs to be re-raised.

:::note

Unlike regular Activities, [Local Activities](/activities#local-activity) can be canceled if they don't send Heartbeats.
Local Activities are handled locally, and all the information needed to handle the cancellation logic is available in the same Worker process.

## How to start a Child Workflow Execution {#child-workflows}

A [Child Workflow Execution](/workflows#child-workflow) is a Workflow Execution that is scheduled from within another Workflow using a Child Workflow API.

When using a Child Workflow API, Child Workflow related Events ([StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#startchildworkflowexecutioninitiated), [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted), [ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutioncompleted), etc...) are logged in the Workflow Execution Event History.

Always block progress until the [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted) Event is logged to the Event History to ensure the Child Workflow Execution has started.
After that, Child Workflow Executions may be abandoned using the default _Abandon_ [Parent Close Policy](/workflows#parent-close-policy) set in the Child Workflow Options.

To be sure that the Child Workflow Execution has started, first call the Child Workflow Execution method on the instance of Child Workflow future, which returns a different future.

Then get the value of an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, which is what waits until the Child Workflow Execution has spawned.

Besides Activities, a Workflow can also start other Workflows.

`Workflow::executeChildWorkflow` and `Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub` enables the scheduling of other Workflows from within a Workflow's implementation.
The parent Workflow has the ability to monitor and impact the lifecycle of the Child Workflow, similar to the way it does for an Activity that it invoked.

```php
// Use one stub per child workflow run
$child = Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub(
    ChildWorkflowInterface::class,
    ChildWorkflowOptions::new()
        // Do not specify WorkflowId if you want Temporal to generate a unique Id
        // for the child execution.
        ->withWorkflowId('BID-SIMPLE-CHILD-WORKFLOW')
        ->withExecutionStartToCloseTimeout(DateInterval::createFromDateString('30 minutes'))
);

// This is a non blocking call that returns immediately.
// Use yield $child->workflowMethod(name) to call synchronously.
$promise = $child->workflowMethod('value');

// Do something else here.
try{
    $value = yield $promise;
} catch(TemporalException $e) {
    $logger->error('child workflow failed');
    throw $e;
}
```

Let's take a look at each component of this call.

Before calling `$child->workflowMethod()`, you must configure `ChildWorkflowOptions` for the invocation.
These options customize various execution timeouts, and are passed into the Workflow stub defined by the `Workflow::newChildWorkflowStub`.
Once stub created you can invoke its Workflow method based on attribute `WorkflowMethod`.

The method call returns immediately and returns a `Promise`.
This allows you to execute more code without having to wait for the scheduled Workflow to complete.

When you are ready to process the results of the Workflow, call the `yield $promise` method on the returned promise object.

When a parent Workflow is cancelled by the user, the Child Workflow can be cancelled or abandoned based on a configurable child policy.

You can also skip the stub part of Child Workflow initiation and use `Workflow::executeChildWorkflow` directly:

```php
// Use one stub per child workflow run
$childResult = yield Workflow::executeChildWorkflow(
    'ChildWorkflowName',
    ['args'],
    ChildWorkflowOptions::new()->withWorkflowId('BID-SIMPLE-CHILD-WORKFLOW'),
    Type::TYPE_STRING // optional: defines the return type
);
```

#### How to set a Parent Close Policy {#parent-close-policy}

A [Parent Close Policy](/workflows#parent-close-policy) determines what happens to a Child Workflow Execution if its Parent changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, or Timed Out).

The default Parent Close Policy option is set to terminate the Child Workflow Execution.

In PHP, a [Parent Close Policy](/workflows#parent-close-policy) is set via the `ChildWorkflowOptions` object and `withParentClosePolicy()` method.
The possible values can be obtained from the [`ParentClosePolicy`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/blob/master/src/Workflow/ParentClosePolicy.php) class.

- `POLICY_TERMINATE`
- `POLICY_ABANDON`
- `POLICY_REQUEST_CANCEL`

Then `ChildWorkflowOptions` object is used to create a new Child Workflow object:

```php
$child = Workflow::newUntypedChildWorkflowStub(
    'child-workflow',
    ChildWorkflowOptions::new()
        ->withParentClosePolicy(ParentClosePolicy::POLICY_ABANDON)
);

yield $child->start();
```

In the snippet above we:

1. Create a new untyped Child Workflow stub with `Workflow::newUntypedChildWorkflowStub`.
2. Provide `ChildWorkflowOptions` object with Parent Close Policy set to `ParentClosePolicy::POLICY_ABANDON`.
3. Start Child Workflow Execution asynchronously using `yield` and method `start()`.

We need `yield` here to ensure that a Child Workflow Execution starts before the parent closes.

## How to Continue-As-New {#continue-as-new}

[Continue-As-New](/workflows#continue-as-new) enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation if the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.
The Workflow Execution spawned from the use of Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.

Workflows that need to rerun periodically could naively be implemented as a big **while** loop with a sleep where the entire logic of the Workflow is inside the body of the **while** loop.
The problem with this approach is that the history for that Workflow will keep growing to a point where it reaches the maximum size enforced by the service.

**ContinueAsNew** is the low level construct that enables implementing such Workflows without the risk of failures down the road.
The operation atomically completes the current execution and starts a new execution of the Workflow with the same **Workflow Id**.
The new execution will not carry over any history from the old execution.

To trigger this behavior, use `Workflow::continueAsNew` or `Workflow::newContinueAsNewStub` method:

```php
#[Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
public function periodic(string $name, int $value = 0)
{
    for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++) {
        // do something
        $value++;
    }

    // maintain $value counter between runs
    return Workflow::newContinueAsNewStub(self::class)->periodic($name, $value);
}
```

## What is a Timer? {#timers}

A Workflow can set a durable timer for a fixed time period.
In some SDKs, the function is called `sleep()`, and in others, it's called `timer()`.

A Workflow can sleep for months.
Timers are persisted, so even if your Worker or Temporal Cluster is down when the time period completes, as soon as your Worker and Cluster are back up, the `sleep()` call will resolve and your code will continue executing.

Sleeping is a resource-light operation: it does not tie up the process, and you can run millions of Timers off a single Worker.

To set a Timer in PHP, use `Workflow::timer()` and pass the number of seconds you want to wait before continuing.

The following example yields a sleep method for 5 minutes.

```php
yield Workflow::timer(300); // sleep for 5 minutes
```

You cannot set a Timer invocation inside the `await` or `awaitWithTimeout` methods.

## How to use Temporal Cron Jobs {#temporal-cron-jobs}

A [Temporal Cron Job](/workflows#temporal-cron-job) is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.

A Cron Schedule is provided as an option when the call to spawn a Workflow Execution is made.

Set your Cron Schedule with `CronSchedule('* * * * *')`.

The following example sets a Cron Schedule in PHP:

```php
  $workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
      CronWorkflowInterface::class,
      WorkflowOptions::new()
          ->withWorkflowId(CronWorkflowInterface::WORKFLOW_ID)
          ->withCronSchedule('* * * * *')
          // Execution timeout limits total time. Cron will stop executing after this timeout.
          ->withWorkflowExecutionTimeout(CarbonInterval::minutes(10))
          // Run timeout limits duration of a single workflow invocation.
          ->withWorkflowRunTimeout(CarbonInterval::minute(1))
  );

  $output->writeln("Starting <comment>CronWorkflow</comment>... ");

  try {
      $run = $this->workflowClient->start($workflow, 'Antony');
      // ...
  }
```

Setting `withCronSchedule` turns the Workflow Execution into a Temporal Cron Job.
For more information, see the [PHP samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php/tree/master/app/src/Cron) for example code or the PHP SDK `WorkflowOptions` [source code](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/blob/master/src/Client/WorkflowOptions.php).

## How to use Side Effects in PHP {#side-effects}

Side Effects are used to execute non-deterministic code, such as generating a UUID or a random number, without compromising determinism in the Workflow. This is done by storing the results of the Side Effect into the Workflow [Event History](/workflows/#event-history).

A Side Effect doesn't re-execute during a Replay. Instead, it returns the recorded result from the Workflow Execution Event History.

Side Effects shouldn't fail. An exception that is thrown from the Side Effect causes failure and retry of the current Workflow Task.

An Activity or a Local Activity can also be used instead of a Side Effect, as its results are also persisted in Workflow Execution History.

:::note

You shouldn’t modify the Workflow state inside a Side Effect, because they're not re-executed during Replay. Side Effect functions should only return a value, and that value can be used in Workflow code to alter state.

:::

To use a Side Effect in PHP, use the `Workflow::sideEffect()` function in your Workflow Definition to run non-deterministic code and return a value.

```php
#[Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
public function run()
{
    $random = yield Workflow::sideEffect(fn()=> return random_int(0, 100));
    if ($random < 50) {
        // ...
    } else {
        // ...
    }
}
```
