## Visibility

The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.

### Search Attributes

The typical method of retrieving a Workflow Execution is by its Workflow Id.

However, sometimes you'll want to retrieve one or more Workflow Executions based on another property. For example, imagine you want to get all Workflow Executions of a certain type that have failed within a time range, so that you can start new ones with the same arguments.

You can do this with <a class="tdlp" href="/concepts/visibility#search-attribute">Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/concepts/visibility#search-attribute">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- <a class="tdlp" href="/concepts/visibility#default-search-attributes">Default Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/concepts/visibility#default-search-attributes">Learn more</a></span></span></a> like `WorkflowType`, `StartTime` and `ExecutionStatus` are automatically added to Workflow Executions.
- _Custom Search Attributes_ can contain their own domain-specific data (like `customerId` or `numItems`).
  - A few <a class="tdlp" href="/concepts/visibility#custom-search-attributes">generic Custom Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/concepts/visibility#custom-search-attributes">Learn more</a></span></span></a> like `CustomKeywordField` and `CustomIntField` are created by default in Temporal's [Docker Compose](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#docker-compose).

The steps to using custom Search Attributes are:

- Create a new Search Attribute in your Cluster using `tctl search-attribute create` or the Cloud UI.
- Set the value of the Search Attribute for a Workflow Execution:
  - On the Client by including it as an option when starting the Execution.
  - In the Workflow by calling `UpsertSearchAttributes`.
- Read the value of the Search Attribute:
  - On the Client by calling `DescribeWorkflow`.
  - In the Workflow by looking at `WorkflowInfo`.
- Query Workflow Executions by the Search Attribute using a <a class="tdlp" href="/concepts/visibility#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/concepts/visibility#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a>:
  - <a class="tdlp" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">In `tctl`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">tctl workflow list</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">How to list open or closed Workflow Executions using tctl.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
  - In code by calling `ListWorkflowExecutions`.

Here is how to query Workflow Executions:

### Custom Search Attributes

After you've created custom Search Attributes in your Cluster (using `tctl search-attribute create`or the Cloud UI), you can set the values of the custom Search Attributes when starting a Workflow.

Use the `WorkflowOptions::withSearchAttributes()` method to provide Search Attributes when you start a Workflow.

```php
$workflow = $this->workflowClient->newWorkflowStub(
    GreetingWorkflowInterface::class,
    WorkflowOptions::new()
        ->withWorkflowExecutionTimeout(CarbonInterval::minute())
        ->withSearchAttributes(
            [
                'CustomKeywordField' => 'value',
                'CustomIntField' => 123,
            ]
        )
);
```

### Upsert Search Attributes

You can upsert Search Attributes to add or update Search Attributes from within Workflow code.

To upsert Search Attributes within a Workflow, use `Workflow::upsertSearchAttributes()`.

```php
class GreetingWorkflow implements GreetingWorkflowInterface
{
    public function getGreeting(string $name)
    {
        Workflow::upsertSearchAttributes(
            [
                'CustomKeywordField' => 'attr1-value',
                'CustomIntField' => 123,
            ]
        );

        // ...
    }
}
```

### Remove Search Attribute

To remove a Search Attribute that was previously set, set it to an empty array: `[]`.
