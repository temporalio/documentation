## Run a development server

This section describes how to install the [Temporal CLI](/cli) and run a development Cluster.
The local development Cluster comes packaged with the [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui).

For information on deploying and running a production Cluster, see the [Cluster deployment guide](/cluster-deployment-guide), or sign up for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud) and let us run your production Cluster for you.

Temporal CLI is a tool for interacting with a Temporal Cluster from the command line and it includes a distribution of the Temporal Server and Web UI.
This local development Cluster runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies and it supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.

**Install the Temporal CLI**

Choose one of the following install methods to install the Temporal CLI.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">

- Install the Temporal CLI with Homebrew.

temporal server start-dev
```

This command automatically starts the Web UI, creates the default [Namespace](/namespaces), and uses an in-memory database.

The Temporal Server should be available on `localhost:7233` and the Temporal Web UI should be accessible at [`http://localhost:8233`](http://localhost:8233/).

The server's startup configuration can be customized using command line options.
For a full list of options, run:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --help
```

## Connect to a dev Cluster

A <a class="tdlp" href="/temporal#temporal-client">Temporal Client<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Client</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Client, provided by a Temporal SDK, provides a set of APIs to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/temporal#temporal-client">Learn more</a></span></span></a> enables you to communicate with the <a class="tdlp" href="/clusters#">Temporal Cluster<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cluster?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cluster is the Temporal Server paired with persistence.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/clusters#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
Communication with a Temporal Cluster includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.

:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.

:::

When you are running a Cluster locally (such as [Temporalite](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#temporalite)), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.
Many SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and [Docker Compose](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#docker-compose) serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).

Use the [`Dial()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Dial) API available in the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client) package to create a [`Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client).

If you don't provide [`HostPort`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions), the Client defaults the address and port number to `127.0.0.1:7233`, which is the port of the development Cluster.

If you don't set a custom Namespace name in the Namespace field, the client connects to the default Namespace.

## Connect to Temporal Cloud

When you connect to [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), you need to provide additional connection and client options that include the following:

- An address that includes your <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Cloud Namespace Name<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and a port number: `<Namespace>.<ID>.tmprl.cloud:<port>`.
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/how-to-manage-certificates-in-temporal-cloud.md).

For more information about configuring TLS to secure inter- and intra-network communication for a Temporal Cluster, see [Temporal Customization Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server).

To connect to and run Workflows through Temporal Cloud, you need the following:

- A compatible mTLS CA certificate and mTLS private key that has been added to your Namespace.

## Develop Workflows

Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Workflow Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Workflow Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is an exportable function.
Below is an example of a basic Workflow Definition.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/yourapp/your_workflow_definition_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
package yourapp

import (
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)
// ...

// YourSimpleWorkflowDefintiion is the most basic Workflow Defintion.
func YourSimpleWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context) error {
	// ...
	return nil
}
```

### Workflow parameters

Temporal Workflows may have any number of custom parameters.
However, we strongly recommend that objects are used as parameters, so that the object's individual fields may be altered without breaking the signature of the Workflow.
All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable.

The first parameter of a Go-based Workflow Definition must be of the [`workflow.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Context) type.
It is used by the Temporal Go SDK to pass around Workflow Execution context, and virtually all the Go SDK APIs that are callable from the Workflow require it.
It is acquired from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow) package.

The `workflow.Context` entity operates similarly to the standard `context.Context` entity provided by Go.
The only difference between `workflow.Context` and `context.Context` is that the `Done()` function, provided by `workflow.Context`, returns `workflow.Channel` instead of the standard Go `chan`.

Additional parameters can be passed to the Workflow when it is invoked.
A Workflow Definition may support multiple custom parameters, or none.
These parameters can be regular type variables or safe pointers.
However, the best practice is to pass a single parameter that is of a `struct` type, so there can be some backward compatibility if new parameters are added.

All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable and can't be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/yourapp/your_workflow_definition_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
package yourapp

import (
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)


// YourWorkflowParam is the object passed to the Workflow.
type YourWorkflowParam struct {
	WorkflowParamX string
	WorkflowParamY int
}
// ...
// YourWorkflowDefinition is your custom Workflow Definition.
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (*YourWorkflowResultObject, error) {	
// ...
}
```

### Workflow return values

Workflow return values must also be serializable.
Returning results, returning errors, or throwing exceptions is fairly idiomatic in each language that is supported.
However, Temporal APIs that must be used to get the result of a Workflow Execution will only ever receive one of either the result or the error.

A Go-based Workflow Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination.
Again, the best practice here is to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values.
A Workflow Definition written in Go can return both a custom value and an error.
However, it's not possible to receive both a custom value and an error in the calling process, as is normal in Go.
The caller will receive either one or the other.
Returning a non-nil `error` from a Workflow indicates that an error was encountered during its execution and the Workflow Execution should be terminated, and any custom return values will be ignored by the system.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/yourapp/your_workflow_definition_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
package yourapp

import (
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)
// ...

// YourWorkflowResultObject is the object returned by the Workflow.
type YourWorkflowResultObject struct {
	WFResultFieldX string
	WFResultFieldY int
}
// ...
// YourWorkflowDefinition is your custom Workflow Definition.
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (*YourWorkflowResultObject, error) {	
// ...
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	// Make the results of the Workflow Execution available.
	workflowResult := &YourWorkflowResultObject{
		WFResultFieldX: activityResult.ResultFieldX,
		WFResultFieldY: activityResult.ResultFieldY,
	}
	return workflowResult, nil
}
```

### Workflow Type

Workflows have a Type that are referred to as the Workflow name.

The following examples demonstrate how to set a custom name for your Workflow Type.

In Go, by default, the Workflow Type name is the same as the function name.

To customize the Workflow Type, set the `Name` parameter with `RegisterOptions` when registering your Workflow with a <a class="tdlp" href="#develop-worker">Worker<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to develop a Worker in Go</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Develop an instance of a Worker by calling worker.New(), available via the go.temporal.io/sdk/worker package.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#develop-worker">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/yourapp/worker/main_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/activity"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"

	"documentation-samples-go/yourapp"
)
// ...
func main() {
// ...
	yourWorker := worker.New(temporalClient, "your-custom-task-queue-name", worker.Options{})
// ...
	// Use RegisterOptions to set the name of the Workflow Type for example.
	registerWFOptions := workflow.RegisterOptions{
		Name: "JustAnotherWorkflow",
	}
	yourWorker.RegisterWorkflowWithOptions(yourapp.YourSimpleWorkflowDefinition, registerWFOptions)
// ...
}
```

### Workflow logic requirements

Workflow logic is constrained by <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#deterministic-constraints">deterministic execution requirements<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#deterministic-constraints">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
Therefore, each language is limited to the use of certain idiomatic techniques.
However, each Temporal SDK provides a set of APIs that can be used inside your Workflow to interact with external (to the Workflow) application code.

In Go, Workflow Definition code cannot directly do the following:

- Iterate over maps using `range`, because with `range` the order of the map's iteration is randomized.
  Instead you can collect the keys of the map, sort them, and then iterate over the sorted keys to access the map.
  This technique provides deterministic results.
  You can also use a Side Effect or an Activity to process the map instead.
- Call an external API, conduct a file I/O operation, talk to another service, etc. (Use an Activity for these.)

The Temporal Go SDK has APIs to handle equivalent Go constructs:

- `workflow.Now()` This is a replacement for `time.Now()`.
- `workflow.Sleep()` This is a replacement for `time.Sleep()`.
- `workflow.GetLogger()` This ensures that the provided logger does not duplicate logs during a replay.
- `workflow.Go()` This is a replacement for the `go` statement.
- `workflow.Channel` This is a replacement for the native `chan` type.
  Temporal provides support for both buffered and unbuffered channels.
- `workflow.Selector` This is a replacement for the `select` statement.
  Learn more on the [Go SDK Selectors](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/go/selectors) page.
- `workflow.Context` This is a replacement for `context.Context`.
  See <a class="tdlp" href="/dev-guide/go/observability#tracing">Tracing<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to setup Tracing</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Tracing allows you to view the call graph of a Workflow along with its Activities and any Child Workflows.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dev-guide/go/observability#tracing">Learn more</a></span></span></a> for more information about context propagation.

## Activity Definition

One of the primary things that Workflows do is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
An Activity is a normal function or method execution that's intended to execute a single, well-defined action (either short or long-running), such as querying a database, calling a third-party API, or transcoding a media file.
An Activity can interact with world outside the Temporal Platform or use a Temporal Client to interact with a Cluster.
For the Workflow to be able to execute the Activity, we must define the <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity Definition is an exportable function or a `struct` method.
Below is an example of both a basic Activity Definition and of an Activity defined as a Struct method.
An _Activity struct_ can have more than one method, with each method acting as a separate Activity Type.
Activities written as struct methods can use shared struct variables, such as:

- an application level DB pool
- client connection to another service
- reusable utilities
- any other expensive resources that you only want to initialize once per process

Because this is such a common need, the rest of this guide shows Activities written as `struct` methods.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/yourapp/your_activity_definition_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
package yourapp

import (
	"context"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/activity"
)
// ...

// YourSimpleActivityDefinition is a basic Activity Definiton.
func YourSimpleActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context) error {
	return nil
}

// YourActivityObject is the struct that maintains shared state across Activities.
// If the Worker crashes this Activity object loses its state.
type YourActivityObject struct {
	Message *string
	Number *int
}

// YourActivityDefinition is your custom Activity Definition.
// An Activity Definiton is an exportable function.
func (a *YourActivityObject) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (*YourActivityResultObject, error) {
// ...
}
```

### Activity parameters

There is no explicit limit to the total number of parameters that an <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a> may support.
However, there is a limit of the total size of the data ends up encoded into a gRPC message Payload.

A single argument is limited to a maximum size of 2 MB.
And the total size of a gRPC message, which includes all the arguments, is limited to a maximum of 4 MB.

Also, keep in mind that all Payload data is recorded in the <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#event-history">Workflow Execution Event History<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Event History?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An append log of Events that represents the full state a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#event-history">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and large Event Histories can affect Worker performance.
This is because the entire Event History could be transferred to a Worker Process with a <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#workflow-task">Workflow Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Task is a Task that contains the context needed to make progress with a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#workflow-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

<!--TODO link to gRPC limit section when available -->

Some SDKs require that you pass context objects, others do not.
When it comes to your application data—that is, data that is serialized and encoded into a Payload—we recommend that you use a single object as an argument that wraps the application data passed to Activities.
This is so that you can change what data is passed to the Activity without breaking a function or method signature.

The first parameter of an Activity Definition is `context.Context`.
This parameter is optional for an Activity Definition, though it is recommended, especially if the Activity is expected to use other Go SDK APIs.

An Activity Definition can support as many other custom parameters as needed.
However, all parameters must be serializable (parameters can’t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers), and it is recommended to pass a single struct that can be updated later.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/yourapp/your_activity_definition_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
// YourActivityParam is the struct passed to your Activity.
// Use a struct so that your function signature remains compatible if fields change.
type YourActivityParam struct {
	ActivityParamX string
	ActivityParamY int
}
// ...
func (a *YourActivityObject) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (*YourActivityResultObject, error) {
// ...
}
```

### Activity return values

All data returned from an Activity must be serializable.

There is no explicit limit to the amount of data that can be returned by an Activity, but keep in mind that all return values are recorded in a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#event-history">Workflow Execution Event History<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Event History?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An append log of Events that represents the full state a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#event-history">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

A Go-based Activity Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination (same as a Workflow Definition).
You may wish to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values, just keep in mind they must all be serializable.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/yourapp/your_activity_definition_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
// YourActivityResultObject is the struct returned from your Activity.
// Use a struct so that you can return multiple values of different types.
// Additionally, your function signature remains compatible if the fields change.
type YourActivityResultObject struct {
	ResultFieldX string
	ResultFieldY int
}
// ...
func (a *YourActivityObject) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (*YourActivityResultObject, error) {
// ...
	result := &YourActivityResultObject{
		ResultFieldX: "Success",
		ResultFieldY: 1,
	}
	// Return the results back to the Workflow Execution.
	// The results persist within the Event History of the Workflow Execution.
	return result, nil
}
```

### Activity Type

Activities have a Type that are referred to as the Activity name.
The following examples demonstrate how to set a custom name for your Activity Type.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/yourapp/worker/main_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
func main() {
// ...
	yourWorker := worker.New(temporalClient, "your-custom-task-queue-name", worker.Options{})
// ...
	// Use RegisterOptions to change the name of the Activity Type for example.
	registerAOptions := activity.RegisterOptions{
		Name: "JustAnotherActivity",
	}
	yourWorker.RegisterActivityWithOptions(yourapp.YourSimpleActivityDefinition, registerAOptions)
	// Run the Worker
	err = yourWorker.Run(worker.InterruptCh())
// ...
}
```

## Activity Execution

Calls to spawn <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-execution">Activity Executions<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a> are written within a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Workflow Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
The call to spawn an Activity Execution generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands/#scheduleactivitytask) Command.
This results in the set of three <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task">Activity Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task contains the context needed to make an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a> related Events ([ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events/#activitytaskscheduled), [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events/#activitytaskstarted), and ActivityTask[Closed])in your Workflow Execution Event History.

A single instance of the Activities implementation is shared across multiple simultaneous Activity invocations.
Therefore, the Activity implementation code must be _stateless_.

The values passed to Activities through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the Execution history.
The entire Execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow Workers when a Workflow state needs to recover.
A large Execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.

Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data you transfer through Activity invocation parameters or Return Values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.

To spawn an <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, call [`ExecuteActivity()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/workflow#ExecuteActivity) inside your Workflow Definition.
The API is available from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/workflow) package.
The `ExecuteActivity()` API call requires an instance of `workflow.Context`, the Activity function name, and any variables to be passed to the Activity Execution.
The Activity function name can be provided as a variable object (no quotations) or as a string.
The benefit of passing the actual function object is that the framework can validate the parameters against the Activity Definition.
The `ExecuteActivity` call returns a Future, which can be used to get the result of the Activity Execution.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/yourapp/your_workflow_definition_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (*YourWorkflowResultObject, error) {	
	// Set the options for the Activity Execution.
	// Either StartToClose Timeout OR ScheduleToClose is required.
	// Not specifying a Task Queue will default to the parent Workflow Task Queue.
	activityOptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
		StartToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
	}
	ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityOptions)
	activityParam := YourActivityParam{
		ActivityParamX: param.WorkflowParamX,
		ActivityParamY: param.WorkflowParamY,
	}
	// Use a nil struct pointer to call Activities that are part of a struct.
	var a *YourActivityObject
	// Execute the Activity and wait for the result.
	var activityResult *YourActivityResultObject
	err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, a.YourActivityDefinition, activityParam).Get(ctx, &activityResult)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
// ...
}
```

### Required timeout

Activity Execution semantics rely on several parameters.
The only required value that needs to be set is either a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Schedule-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Start-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
These values are set in the Activity Options.

To set an Activity Timeout in Go, create an instance of `ActivityOptions` from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package, set the Activity Timeout field, and then use the `WithActivityOptions()` API to apply the options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

Available timeouts are:

- `StartToCloseTimeout`
- `ScheduleToClose`
- `ScheduleToStartTimeout`

```go
activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  // Set Activity Timeout duration
  ScheduleToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
  // StartToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
  // ScheduleToStartTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

### Get Activity results

The call to spawn an <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a> generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands/#scheduleactivitytask) Command and provides the Workflow with an Awaitable.
Workflow Executions can either block progress until the result is available through the Awaitable or continue progressing, making use of the result when it becomes available.

The `ExecuteActivity` API call returns an instance of [`workflow.Future`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Futures) which has the following two methods:

- `Get()`: Takes an instance of the `workflow.Context`, that was passed to the Activity Execution, and a pointer as parameters.
  The variable associated with the pointer is populated with the Activity Execution result.
  This call blocks until the results are available.
- `IsReady()`: Returns `true` when the result of the Activity Execution is ready.

Call the `Get()` method on the instance of `workflow.Future` to get the result of the Activity Execution.
The type of the result parameter must match the type of the return value declared by the Activity function.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
 // ...
 future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
 var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
 if err := future.Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult); err != nil {
   // ...
 }
 // ...
}
```

Use the `IsReady()` method first to make sure the `Get()` call doesn't cause the Workflow Execution to wait on the result.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
 // ...
 future := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam)
 // ...
 if(future.IsReady()) {
   var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
   if err := future.Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult); err != nil {
     // ...
   }
 }
 // ...
}
```

It is idiomatic to invoke multiple Activity Executions from within a Workflow.
Therefore, it is also idiomatic to either block on the results of the Activity Executions or continue on to execute additional logic, checking for the Activity Execution results at a later time.

## Develop Worker

The <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#worker-process">Worker Process<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Worker Process?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Worker Process is responsible for polling a Task Queue, dequeueing a Task, executing your code in response to a Task, and responding to the Temporal Server with the results.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#worker-process">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is where Workflow Functions and Activity Functions are executed.

- Each <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#worker-entity">Worker Entity<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Worker Entity?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Worker Entity is the individual Worker within a Worker Process that listens to a specific Task Queue.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#worker-entity">Learn more</a></span></span></a> in the Worker Process must register the exact Workflow Types and Activity Types it may execute.
- Each Worker Entity must also associate itself with exactly one <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#task-queue">Task Queue<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Task Queue?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Task Queue is a first-in, first-out queue that a Worker Process polls for Tasks.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#task-queue">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
- Each Worker Entity polling the same Task Queue must be registered with the same Workflow Types and Activity Types.

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#worker-entity">Worker Entity<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Worker Entity?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Worker Entity is the individual Worker within a Worker Process that listens to a specific Task Queue.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#worker-entity">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is the component within a Worker Process that listens to a specific Task Queue.

Although multiple Worker Entities can be in a single Worker Process, a single Worker Entity Worker Process may be perfectly sufficient.
For more information, see the [Worker tuning guide](/dev-guide/worker-performance).

A Worker Entity contains both a Workflow Worker and an Activity Worker so that it can make progress for either a Workflow Execution or an Activity Execution.

Create an instance of [`Worker`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#Worker) by calling [`worker.New()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#New), available through the `go.temporal.io/sdk/worker` package, and pass it the following parameters:

1. An instance of the Temporal Go SDK `Client`.
1. The name of the Task Queue that it will poll.
1. An instance of `worker.Options`, which can be empty.

Then, register the Workflow Types and the Activity Types that the Worker will be capable of executing.

Lastly, call either the `Start()` or the `Run()` method on the instance of the Worker.
Run accepts an interrupt channel as a parameter, so that the Worker can be stopped in the terminal.
Otherwise, the `Stop()` method must be called to stop the Worker.

:::tip

If you have [`gow`](https://github.com/mitranim/gow) installed, the Worker Process automatically "reloads" when you update the Worker file:

```bash
go install github.com/mitranim/gow@latest
gow run worker/main.go # automatically reloads when file changes
```

## Run a Temporal Cloud Worker

To run a Worker that uses [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), you need to provide additional connection and client options that include the following:

- An address that includes your <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Cloud Namespace Name<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and a port number: `<Namespace>.<ID>.tmprl.cloud:<port>`.
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/how-to-manage-certificates-in-temporal-cloud.md).

For more information about configuring TLS to secure inter- and intra-network communication for a Temporal Cluster, see [Temporal Customization Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server).

To run a Worker that talks to Temporal Cloud, you need the following:

- A compatible mTLS CA certificate and mTLS private key that has been added to your Namespace.

### Register types

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it fails that Task.
However, the failure of the Task does not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

The `RegisterWorkflow()` and `RegisterActivity()` calls essentially create an in-memory mapping between the Workflow Types and their implementations, inside the Worker process.

**Registering Activity `structs`**

Per <a class="tdlp" href="#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to develop an Activity Definition in Go</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity Definition is an exportable function or a `struct` method.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a> best practices, you might have an Activity struct that has multiple methods and fields.
When you use `RegisterActivity()` for an Activity struct, that Worker has access to all exported methods.

**Registering multiple Types**

To register multiple Activity Types and/or Workflow Types with the Worker Entity, just make multiple Activity registration calls, but make sure each Type name is unique:

```go
w.RegisterActivity(ActivityA)
w.RegisterActivity(ActivityB)
w.RegisterActivity(ActivityC)
w.RegisterWorkflow(WorkflowA)
w.RegisterWorkflow(WorkflowB)
w.RegisterWorkflow(WorkflowC)
```

## Start Workflow Execution

[Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) semantics rely on several parameters—that is, to start a Workflow Execution you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type, language-specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

In the examples below, all Workflow Executions are started using a Temporal Client.
To spawn Workflow Executions from within another Workflow Execution, use either the [Child Workflow](#child-workflows) or External Workflow APIs.

See the [Customize Workflow Type](#customize-workflow-type) section to see how to customize the name of the Workflow Type.

A request to spawn a Workflow Execution causes the Temporal Cluster to create the first Event ([WorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events/#workflowexecutionstarted)) in the Workflow Execution Event History.
The Temporal Cluster then creates the first Workflow Task, resulting in the first [WorkflowTaskScheduled](/references/events/#workflowtaskscheduled) Event.

To spawn a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution), use the `ExecuteWorkflow()` method on the Go SDK [`Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client).

The `ExecuteWorkflow()` API call requires an instance of [`context.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context), an instance of [`StartWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#StartWorkflowOptions), a Workflow Type name, and all variables to be passed to the Workflow Execution.
The `ExecuteWorkflow()` call returns a Future, which can be used to get the result of the Workflow Execution.

```go
package main

import (
  // ...

  "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)

func main() {
  temporalClient, err := client.Dial(client.Options{})
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  defer temporalClient.Close()
  // ...
  workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
    // ...
  }
  workflowRun, err := temporalClient.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) (YourWorkflowResponse, error) {
  // ...
}
```

If the invocation process has access to the function directly, then the Workflow Type name parameter can be passed as if the function name were a variable, without quotations.

```go
workflowRun, err := temporalClient.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
```

If the invocation process does not have direct access to the statically defined Workflow Definition, for example, if the Workflow Definition is in an un-importable package, or it is written in a completely different language, then the Workflow Type can be provided as a `string`.

```go
workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, "YourWorkflowDefinition", param)
```

### Set Task Queue

In most SDKs, the only Workflow Option that must be set is the name of the <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#task-queue">Task Queue<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Task Queue?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Task Queue is a first-in, first-out queue that a Worker Process polls for Tasks.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#task-queue">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

For any code to execute, a Worker Process must be running that contains a Worker Entity that is polling the same Task Queue name.

Create an instance of [`StartWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.10.0/client#StartWorkflowOptions) from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/client` package, set the `TaskQueue` field, and pass the instance to the `ExecuteWorkflow` call.

- Type: `string`
- Default: None, this is a required field to be set by the developer

```go
workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
  // ...
  TaskQueue: "your-task-queue",
  // ...
}
workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

### Workflow Id

Although it is not required, we recommend providing your own <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-id">Workflow Id<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Id?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Id is a customizable, application-level identifier for a Workflow Execution that is unique to an Open Workflow Execution within a Namespace.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-id">Learn more</a></span></span></a> that maps to a business process or business entity identifier, such as an order identifier or customer identifier.

Create an instance of [`StartWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.10.0/client#StartWorkflowOptions) from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/client` package, set the `ID` field, and pass the instance to the `ExecuteWorkflow` call.

- Type: `string`
- Default: System generated UUID

```go
workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
  // ...
  ID: "Your-Custom-Workflow-Id",
  // ...
}
workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

### Get Workflow results

If the call to start a Workflow Execution is successful, you will gain access to the Workflow Execution's Run Id.

The Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace may be used to uniquely identify a Workflow Execution in the system and get its result.

It's possible to both block progress on the result (synchronous execution) or get the result at some other point in time (asynchronous execution).

In the Temporal Platform, it's also acceptable to use Queries as the preferred method for accessing the state and results of Workflow Executions.

The `ExecuteWorkflow` call returns an instance of [`WorkflowRun`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#WorkflowRun), which is the `workflowRun` variable in the following line.

```go
 workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, app.YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
 if err != nil {
   // ...
 }
 // ...
}
```

The instance of `WorkflowRun` has the following three methods:

- `GetWorkflowID()`: Returns the Workflow Id of the invoked Workflow Execution.
- `GetRunID()`: Always returns the Run Id of the initial Run (See [Continue As New](#)) in the series of Runs that make up the full Workflow Execution.
- `Get`: Takes a pointer as a parameter and populates the associated variable with the Workflow Execution result.

To wait on the result of Workflow Execution in the same process that invoked it, call `Get()` on the instance of `WorkflowRun` that is returned by the `ExecuteWorkflow()` call.

```go
 workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition, param)
 if err != nil {
   // ...
 }
 var result YourWorkflowResponse
 err = workflowRun.Get(context.Background(), &result)
 if err != nil {
     // ...
 }
 // ...
}
```

However, the result of a Workflow Execution can be obtained from a completely different process.
All that is needed is the [Workflow Id](#).
(A [Run Id](#) is optional if more than one closed Workflow Execution has the same Workflow Id.)
The result of the Workflow Execution is available for as long as the Workflow Execution Event History remains in the system.

<!-- TODO (See [How long do Workflow Execution Histories persist](#)). -->

Call the `GetWorkflow()` method on an instance of the Go SDK Client and pass it the Workflow Id used to spawn the Workflow Execution.
Then call the `Get()` method on the instance of `WorkflowRun` that is returned, passing it a pointer to populate the result.

```go
 // ...
 workflowID := "Your-Custom-Workflow-Id"
 workflowRun := c.GetWorkflow(context.Background, workflowID)

 var result YourWorkflowResponse
 err = workflowRun.Get(context.Background(), &result)
 if err != nil {
     // ...
 }
 // ...
```

**Get last completion result**

In the case of a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Temporal Cron Job<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cron Job?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, you might need to get the result of the previous Workflow Run and use it in the current Workflow Run.

To do this, use the [`HasLastCompletionResult`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#HasLastCompletionResult) and [`GetLastCompletionResult`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLastCompletionResult) APIs, available from the [`go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow) package, directly in your Workflow code.

```go
type CronResult struct {
 Count int
}

func YourCronWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context) (CronResult, error) {
 count := 1

 if workflow.HasLastCompletionResult(ctx) {
   var lastResult CronResult
   if err := workflow.GetLastCompletionResult(ctx, &lastResult); err == nil {
     count = count + lastResult.Count
   }
 }

 newResult := CronResult {
   Count: count,
 }
 return newResult, nil
}
```

This will work even if one of the cron Workflow Runs fails.
The next Workflow Run gets the result of the last successfully Completed Workflow Run.
