## Signals

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#signal">Signal<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Signal?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Signal is an asynchronous request to a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#signal">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a message sent to a running Workflow Execution.

Signals are defined in your code and handled in your Workflow Definition.
Signals can be sent to Workflow Executions from a Temporal Client or from another Workflow Execution.

### Define Signal

A Signal has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Signal type, is a string.
- The arguments must be <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#">serializable<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Structs should be used to define Signals and carry data, as long as the struct is [serializable via the Data Converter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#CompositeDataConverter.ToPayload).
The `Receive()` method on the Data Converter decodes the data into the Struct within the Workflow.
Only public fields are serializable.

```go
MySignal struct {
	Message string // serializable
	message string // not serializable
}
```

### Handle Signal

Workflows listen for Signals by the Signal's name.

Use the `GetSignalChannel()` API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package to get the Signal Channel.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {
  // ...
  var signal MySignal
  signalChan := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, "your-signal-name")
  signalChan.Receive(ctx, &signal)
  if len(signal.Message) > 0 && signal.Message != "SOME_VALUE" {
      return errors.New("signal")
  }
  // ...
}
```

In the example above, the Workflow code uses `workflow.GetSignalChannel` to open a `workflow.Channel` for the Signal type (identified by the Signal name).

Before completing the Workflow or using <a class="tdlp" href="#continue-as-new">Continue-As-New<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to Continue-As-New</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Continue-As-New enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation if the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#continue-as-new">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, make sure to do an asynchronous drain on the Signal channel.
Otherwise, the Signals will be lost.

### Send Signal from Client

When a Signal is sent successfully from the Temporal Client, the <a class="tdlp" href="/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled">WorkflowExecutionSignaled<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">Events reference</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Events are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to external occurrences and Commands generated by a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled">Learn more</a></span></span></a> Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.

Use the `SignalWorkflow()` method on an instance of the [Go SDK Temporal Client](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client) to send a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#signal">Signal<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Signal?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Signal is an asynchronous request to a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#signal">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution).

Pass in both the <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-id">Workflow Id<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Id?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Id is a customizable, application-level identifier for a Workflow Execution that is unique to an Open Workflow Execution within a Namespace.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-id">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#run-id">Run Id<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Run Id?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Run Id is a globally unique, platform-level identifier for a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#run-id">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to uniquely identify the Workflow Execution.
If only the Workflow Id is supplied (provide an empty string as the Run Id param), the Workflow Execution that is Running receives the Signal.

```go
// ...
signal := MySignal {
  Message: "Some important data",
}
err = temporalClient.SignalWorkflow(context.Background(), "your-workflow-id", runID, "your-signal-name", signal)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("Error sending the Signal", err)
	return
}
// ...
```

Possible errors:

- `serviceerror.NotFound`
- `serviceerror.Internal`
- `serviceerror.Unavailable`

### Send Signal from Workflow

A Workflow can send a Signal to another Workflow, in which case it's called an _External Signal_.

When an External Signal is sent:

- A <a class="tdlp" href="/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated">SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">Events reference</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Events are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to external occurrences and Commands generated by a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated">Learn more</a></span></span></a> Event appears in the sender's Event History.
- A <a class="tdlp" href="/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled">WorkflowExecutionSignaled<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">Events reference</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Events are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to external occurrences and Commands generated by a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled">Learn more</a></span></span></a> Event appears in the recipient's Event History.

A Signal can be sent from within a Workflow to a different Workflow Execution using the [`SignalExternalWorkflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#SignalExternalWorkflow) API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package.

```go
// ...
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {
  //...
  signal := MySignal {
    Message: "Some important data",
  }
  err :=  workflow.SignalExternalWorkflow(ctx, "some-workflow-id", "", "your-signal-name", signal).Get(ctx, nil)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
// ...
}
```

### Signal-With-Start

Signal-With-Start is used from the Client.
It takes a Workflow Id, Workflow arguments, a Signal name, and Signal arguments.

If there's a Workflow running with the given Workflow Id, it will be signaled. If there isn't, a new Workflow will be started and immediately signaled.

Use the `SignalWithStartWorkflow()` API on the Go SDK Temporal Client to start a Workflow Execution (if not already running) and pass it the Signal at the same time.

Because the Workflow Execution might not exist, this API does not take a Run ID as a parameter

```go
// ...
signal := MySignal {
  Message: "Some important data",
}
err = temporalClient.SignalWithStartWorkflow(context.Background(), "your-workflow-id", "your-signal-name", signal)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("Error sending the Signal", err)
	return
}
```

## Queries

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#query">Query<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Query?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Query is a synchronous operation that is used to report the state of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#query">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.

### Define Query

A Query has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Query type, is a string.
- The arguments must be <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#">serializable<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

In Go, a Query type, also called a Query name, is a `string` value.

```go
queryType := "your_query_name"
```

### Handle Query

Queries are handled by your Workflow.

Don’t include any logic that causes <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#command">Command<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Command?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Command is a requested action issued by a Worker to the Temporal Cluster after a Workflow Task Execution completes.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#command">Learn more</a></span></span></a> generation within a Query handler (such as executing Activities).
Including such logic causes unexpected behavior.

Use the `SetQueryHandler` API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package to set a Query Handler that listens for a Query by name.

The handler must be a function that returns two values:

1. A serializable result
2. An error

The handler function can receive any number of input parameters, but all input parameters must be serializable.
The following sample code sets up a Query Handler that handles the `current_state` Query type:

```go
func YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, input string) error {
  currentState := "started" // This could be any serializable struct.
  queryType := "current_state"
  err := workflow.SetQueryHandler(ctx, queryType, func() (string, error) {
    return currentState, nil
  })
  if err != nil {
    currentState = "failed to register query handler"
    return err
  }
  // Your normal Workflow code begins here, and you update the currentState as the code makes progress.
  currentState = "waiting timer"
  err = NewTimer(ctx, time.Hour).Get(ctx, nil)
  if err != nil {
    currentState = "timer failed"
    return err
  }
  currentState = "waiting activity"
  ctx = WithActivityOptions(ctx, yourActivityOptions)
  err = ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivity, "your_input").Get(ctx, nil)
  if err != nil {
    currentState = "activity failed"
    return err
  }
  currentState = "done"
  return nil
}
```

For example, suppose your query handler function takes two parameters:

```go
err := workflow.SetQueryHandler(ctx, "current_state", func(prefix string, suffix string) (string, error) {
    return prefix + currentState + suffix, nil
})
```

### Send Query

Queries are sent from a Temporal Client.

Use the `QueryWorkflow()` API or the `QueryWorkflowWithOptions` API on the Temporal Client to send a Query to a Workflow Execution.

```go
// ...
response, err := temporalClient.QueryWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowID, runID, queryType)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
// ...
```

You can pass an arbitrary number of arguments to the `QueryWorkflow()` function.

```go
// ...
response, err := temporalClient.QueryWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowID, runID, queryType, "foo", "baz")
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
// ...
```

The `QueryWorkflowWithOptions()` API provides similar functionality, but with the ability to set additional configurations through [QueryWorkflowWithOptionsRequest](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#QueryWorkflowWithOptionsRequest).
When using this API, you will also receive a structured response of type [QueryWorkflowWithOptionsResponse](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#QueryWorkflowWithOptionsResponse).

```go
// ...
response, err := temporalClient.QueryWorkflowWithOptions(context.Background(), &client.QueryWorkflowWithOptionsRequest{
    WorkflowID: workflowID,
    RunID: runID,
    QueryType: queryType,
    Args: args,
})
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

## Workflow timeouts

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when <a class="tdlp" href="#workflow-timeouts">starting the Workflow Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">Workflow timeouts</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#workflow-timeouts">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- **<a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-execution-timeout">Workflow Execution Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Execution Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Execution Timeout is the maximum time that a Workflow Execution can be executing (have an Open status) including retries and any usage of Continue As New.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-execution-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **<a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-run-timeout">Workflow Run Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Run Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">This is the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run is restricted to.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-run-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>**: restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **<a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-task-timeout">Workflow Task Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Task Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Task Timeout is the maximum amount of time that the Temporal Server will wait for a Worker to start processing a Workflow Task after the Task has been pulled from the Task Queue.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-task-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>**: restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

Create an instance of [`StartWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#StartWorkflowOptions) from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/client` package, set a timeout, and pass the instance to the `ExecuteWorkflow` call.

Available timeouts are:

- `WorkflowExecutionTimeout`
- `WorkflowRunTimeout`
- `WorkflowTaskTimeout`

```go
workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
  // ...
  // Set Workflow Timeout duration
  WorkflowExecutionTimeout: time.Hours * 24 * 365 * 10,
  // WorkflowRunTimeout: time.Hours * 24 * 365 * 10,
  // WorkflowTaskTimeout: time.Second * 10,
  // ...
}
workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

### Workflow retries

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#">Retry Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

Create an instance of a [`RetryPolicy`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal#RetryPolicy) from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal` package and provide it as the value to the `RetryPolicy` field of the instance of `StartWorkflowOptions`.

- Type: [`RetryPolicy`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal#RetryPolicy)
- Default: None

```go
retrypolicy := &temporal.RetryPolicy{
  InitialInterval:    time.Second,
  BackoffCoefficient: 2.0,
  MaximumInterval:    time.Second * 100,
}
workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
  RetryPolicy: retrypolicy,
  // ...
}
workflowRun, err := temporalClient.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

## Activity timeouts

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **<a class="tdlp" href="/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout">Schedule-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule-To-Close Timeout is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall Activity Execution, from when the first Activity Task is scheduled to when the last Activity Task, in the chain of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution, reaches a Closed status.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>**: is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- **<a class="tdlp" href="/activities#schedule-to-start-timeout">Schedule-To-Start Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule-To-Start Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule-To-Start Timeout is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an Activity Task is placed in a Task Queue to when a Worker picks it up from the Task Queue.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#schedule-to-start-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>**: is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#activity-task">Activity Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task contains the context needed to make an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#activity-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is scheduled to when a <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#worker">Worker<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Worker?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In day-to-day conversations, the term Worker is used to denote both a Worker Program and a Worker Process. Temporal documentation aims to be explicit and differentiate between them.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#worker">Learn more</a></span></span></a> starts that Activity Task.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

To set an Activity Timeout in Go, create an instance of `ActivityOptions` from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package, set the Activity Timeout field, and then use the `WithActivityOptions()` API to apply the options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

Available timeouts are:

- `StartToCloseTimeout`
- `ScheduleToClose`
- `ScheduleToStartTimeout`

```go
activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  // Set Activity Timeout duration
  ScheduleToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
  // StartToCloseTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
  // ScheduleToStartTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

### Activity retries

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#">Retry Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> if a custom one is not provided.

To set a <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#">RetryPolicy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, create an instance of `ActivityOptions` from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package, set the `RetryPolicy` field, and then use the `WithActivityOptions()` API to apply the options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

- Type: [`RetryPolicy`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal#RetryPolicy)
- Default:

```go
retrypolicy := &temporal.RetryPolicy{
  InitialInterval:    time.Second,
  BackoffCoefficient: 2.0,
  MaximumInterval:    time.Second * 100, // 100 * InitialInterval
  MaximumAttempts: 0, // Unlimited
  NonRetryableErrorTypes: []string, // empty
}
```

Providing a Retry Policy here is a customization, and overwrites individual Field defaults.

```go
retrypolicy := &temporal.RetryPolicy{
  InitialInterval:    time.Second,
  BackoffCoefficient: 2.0,
  MaximumInterval:    time.Second * 100,
}

activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  RetryPolicy: retrypolicy,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

## Activity Heartbeats

Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Cluster that the <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.
If the Cluster does not receive a Heartbeat within a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Heartbeat Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Heartbeat Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Heartbeat Timeout is the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> time period, the Activity will be considered failed and another <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#activity-task-execution">Activity Task Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task Execution occurs when a Worker uses the context provided from the Activity Task and executes the Activity Definition.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#activity-task-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a> may be scheduled according to the Retry Policy.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Cluster—they may be <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#throttling">throttled<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Heartbeat?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Cluster when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Cluster.

To <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-heartbeat">Heartbeat<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Heartbeat?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster. Each ping informs the Temporal Cluster that the Activity Execution is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-heartbeat">Learn more</a></span></span></a> in an Activity in Go, use the `RecordHeartbeat` API.

```go
import (
    // ...
    "go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
    // ...
)

func YourActivityDefinition(ctx, YourActivityDefinitionParam) (YourActivityDefinitionResult, error) {
    // ...
    activity.RecordHeartbeat(ctx, details)
    // ...
}
```

When an Activity Task Execution times out due to a missed Heartbeat, the last value of the `details` variable above is returned to the calling Workflow in the `details` field of `TimeoutError` with `TimeoutType` set to `Heartbeat`.

You can also Heartbeat an Activity from an external source:

```go
// The client is a heavyweight object that should be created once per process.
temporalClient, err := client.Dial(client.Options{})
// Record heartbeat.
err := temporalClient.RecordActivityHeartbeat(ctx, taskToken, details)
```

The parameters of the `RecordActivityHeartbeat` function are:

- `taskToken`: The value of the binary `TaskToken` field of the `ActivityInfo` struct retrieved inside
  the Activity.
- `details`: The serializable payload containing progress information.

If an Activity Execution Heartbeats its progress before it failed, the retry attempt will have access to the progress information, so that the Activity Execution can resume from the failed state.
Here's an example of how this can be implemented:

```go
func SampleActivity(ctx context.Context, inputArg InputParams) error {
    startIdx := inputArg.StartIndex
    if activity.HasHeartbeatDetails(ctx) {
        // Recover from finished progress.
        var finishedIndex int
        if err := activity.GetHeartbeatDetails(ctx, &finishedIndex); err == nil {
            startIdx = finishedIndex + 1 // Start from next one.
        }
    }

    // Normal Activity logic...
    for i:=startIdx; i<inputArg.EndIdx; i++ {
        // Code for processing item i goes here...
        activity.RecordHeartbeat(ctx, i) // Report progress.
    }
}
```

#### Heartbeat Timeout

A <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Heartbeat Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Heartbeat Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Heartbeat Timeout is the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> works in conjunction with <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-heartbeat">Activity Heartbeats<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Heartbeat?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster.

To set a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Heartbeat Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Heartbeat Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Heartbeat Timeout is the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, Create an instance of `ActivityOptions` from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package, set the `RetryPolicy` field, and then use the `WithActivityOptions()` API to apply the options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

```go
activityoptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
  HeartbeatTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
}
ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityoptions)
var yourActivityResult YourActivityResult
err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivityDefinition, yourActivityParam).Get(ctx, &yourActivityResult)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

## Asynchronous Activity Completion

<a class="tdlp" href="/activities#asynchronous-activity-completion">Asynchronous Activity Completion<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Asynchronous Activity Completion?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Asynchronous Activity Completion occurs when an external system provides the final result of a computation, started by an Activity, to the Temporal System.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#asynchronous-activity-completion">Learn more</a></span></span></a> enables the Activity Function to return without the Activity Execution completing.

There are three steps to follow:

1. The Activity provides the external system with identifying information needed to complete the Activity Execution.
   Identifying information can be a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#task-token">Task Token<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Task Token?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Task Token is a unique Id that correlates to an Activity Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#task-token">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, or a combination of Namespace, Workflow Id, and Activity Id.
2. The Activity Function completes in a way that identifies it as waiting to be completed by an external system.
3. The Temporal Client is used to Heartbeat and complete the Activity.

4. Provide the external system with a Task Token to complete the Activity Execution.
   To do this, use the `GetInfo()` API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/activity` package.

```go
// Retrieve the Activity information needed to asynchronously complete the Activity.
activityInfo := activity.GetInfo(ctx)
taskToken := activityInfo.TaskToken
// Send the taskToken to the external service that will complete the Activity.
```

2. Return an `activity.ErrResultPending` error to indicate that the Activity is completing asynchronously.

```go
return "", activity.ErrResultPending
```

3. Use the Temporal Client to complete the Activity using the Task Token.

```go
// Instantiate a Temporal service client.
// The same client can be used to complete or fail any number of Activities.
// The client is a heavyweight object that should be created once per process.
temporalClient, err := client.Dial(client.Options{})

// Complete the Activity.
temporalClient.CompleteActivity(context.Background(), taskToken, result, nil)
```

The following are the parameters of the `CompleteActivity` function:

- `taskToken`: The value of the binary `TaskToken` field of the `ActivityInfo` struct retrieved inside
  the Activity.
- `result`: The return value to record for the Activity. The type of this value must match the type
  of the return value declared by the Activity function.
- `err`: The error code to return if the Activity terminates with an error.

If `error` is not null, the value of the `result` field is ignored.

To fail the Activity, you would do the following:

```go
// Fail the Activity.
client.CompleteActivity(context.Background(), taskToken, nil, err)
```

## Child Workflows

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#child-workflow">Child Workflow Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Child Workflow Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Child Workflow Execution is a Workflow Execution that is spawned from within another Workflow.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#child-workflow">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a Workflow Execution that is scheduled from within another Workflow using a Child Workflow API.

When using a Child Workflow API, Child Workflow related Events (<a class="tdlp" href="/references/events#startchildworkflowexecutioninitiated">StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">Events reference</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Events are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to external occurrences and Commands generated by a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/references/events#startchildworkflowexecutioninitiated">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, <a class="tdlp" href="/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted">ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">Events reference</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Events are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to external occurrences and Commands generated by a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, <a class="tdlp" href="/references/events#childworkflowexecutioncompleted">ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">Events reference</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Events are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to external occurrences and Commands generated by a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/references/events#childworkflowexecutioncompleted">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, etc...) are logged in the Workflow Execution Event History.

Always block progress until the <a class="tdlp" href="/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted">ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">Events reference</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Events are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to external occurrences and Commands generated by a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted">Learn more</a></span></span></a> Event is logged to the Event History to ensure the Child Workflow Execution has started.
After that, Child Workflow Executions may be abandoned using the default _Abandon_ <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Parent Close Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Parent Close Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">If a Workflow Execution is a Child Workflow Execution, a Parent Close Policy determines what happens to the Workflow Execution if its Parent Workflow Execution changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, Timed out).</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Learn more</a></span></span></a> set in the Child Workflow Options.

To be sure that the Child Workflow Execution has started, first call the Child Workflow Execution method on the instance of Child Workflow future, which returns a different future.

Then get the value of an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, which is what waits until the Child Workflow Execution has spawned.

To spawn a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#child-workflow">Child Workflow Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Child Workflow Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Child Workflow Execution is a Workflow Execution that is spawned from within another Workflow.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#child-workflow">Learn more</a></span></span></a> in Go, use the [`ExecuteChildWorkflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ExecuteChildWorkflow) API, which is available from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package.

The `ExecuteChildWorkflow` call requires an instance of [`workflow.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Context), with an instance of [`workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ChildWorkflowOptions) applied to it, the Workflow Type, and any parameters that should be passed to the Child Workflow Execution.

`workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions` contain the same fields as `client.StartWorkflowOptions`.
Workflow Option fields automatically inherit their values from the Parent Workflow Options if they are not explicitly set.
If a custom `WorkflowID` is not set, one is generated when the Child Workflow Execution is spawned.
Use the [`WithChildOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#WithChildOptions) API to apply Child Workflow Options to the instance of `workflow.Context`.

The `ExecuteChildWorkflow` call returns an instance of a [`ChildWorkflowFuture`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ChildWorkflowFuture).

Call the `.Get()` method on the instance of `ChildWorkflowFuture` to wait for the result.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ParentParams) (ParentResp, error) {

  childWorkflowOptions := workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions{}
  ctx = workflow.WithChildOptions(ctx, childWorkflowOptions)

  var result ChildResp
  err := workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow(ctx, YourOtherWorkflowDefinition, ChildParams{}).Get(ctx, &result)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
  return resp, nil
}

func YourOtherWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ChildParams) (ChildResp, error) {
  // ...
  return resp, nil
}
```

To asynchronously spawn a Child Workflow Execution, the Child Workflow must have an "Abandon" Parent Close Policy set in the Child Workflow Options.
Additionally, the Parent Workflow Execution must wait for the `ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted` Event to appear in its Event History before it completes.

If the Parent makes the `ExecuteChildWorkflow` call and then immediately completes, the Child Workflow Execution does not spawn.

To be sure that the Child Workflow Execution has started, first call the `GetChildWorkflowExecution` method on the instance of the `ChildWorkflowFuture`, which will return a different Future.
Then call the `Get()` method on that Future, which is what will wait until the Child Workflow Execution has spawned.

```go
import (
  // ...
  "go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1"
)

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ParentParams) (ParentResp, error) {

  childWorkflowOptions := workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions{
    ParentClosePolicy: enums.PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_ABANDON,
  }
  ctx = workflow.WithChildOptions(ctx, childWorkflowOptions)

  childWorkflowFuture := workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow(ctx, YourOtherWorkflowDefinition, ChildParams{})
  // Wait for the Child Workflow Execution to spawn
  var childWE workflow.Execution
  if err := childWorkflowFuture.GetChildWorkflowExecution().Get(ctx, &childWE); err != nil {
     return err
  }
  // ...
  return resp, nil
}

func YourOtherWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ChildParams) (ChildResp, error) {
  // ...
  return resp, nil
}
```

#### Parent Close Policy

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Parent Close Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Parent Close Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">If a Workflow Execution is a Child Workflow Execution, a Parent Close Policy determines what happens to the Workflow Execution if its Parent Workflow Execution changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, Timed out).</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Learn more</a></span></span></a> determines what happens to a Child Workflow Execution if its Parent changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, or Timed Out).

The default Parent Close Policy option is set to terminate the Child Workflow Execution.

In Go, a Parent Close Policy is set on the `ParentClosePolicy` field of an instance of [`workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#ChildWorkflowOptions).
The possible values can be obtained from the [`go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1#ParentClosePolicy) package.

- `PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_ABANDON`
- `PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_TERMINATE`
- `PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_REQUEST_CANCEL`

The Child Workflow Options are then applied to the instance of `workflow.Context` by using the `WithChildOptions` API, which is then passed to the `ExecuteChildWorkflow()` call.

- Type: [`ParentClosePolicy`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1#ParentClosePolicy)
- Default: `PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_TERMINATE`

```go
import (
  // ...
  "go.temporal.io/api/enums/v1"
)

func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ParentParams) (ParentResp, error) {
  // ...
  childWorkflowOptions := workflow.ChildWorkflowOptions{
    // ...
    ParentClosePolicy: enums.PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_ABANDON,
  }
  ctx = workflow.WithChildOptions(ctx, childWorkflowOptions)
  childWorkflowFuture := workflow.ExecuteChildWorkflow(ctx, YourOtherWorkflowDefinition, ChildParams{})
  // ...
}

func YourOtherWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, params ChildParams) (ChildResp, error) {
  // ...
  return resp, nil
}
```

## Continue-As-New

<a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Continue-As-New<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Continue-As-New?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Continue-As-New is the mechanism by which all relevant state is passed to a new Workflow Execution with a fresh Event History.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Learn more</a></span></span></a> enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation if the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.
The Workflow Execution spawned from the use of Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.

To cause a Workflow Execution to <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Continue-As-New<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Continue-As-New?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Continue-As-New is the mechanism by which all relevant state is passed to a new Workflow Execution with a fresh Event History.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, the Workflow API should return the result of the [`NewContinueAsNewError()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#NewContinueAsNewError) function available from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package.

```go
func SimpleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, value string) error {
    ...
    return workflow.NewContinueAsNewError(ctx, SimpleWorkflow, value)
}
```

To check whether a Workflow Execution was spawned as a result of Continue-As-New, you can check if `workflow.GetInfo(ctx).ContinuedExecutionRunID` is not empty (i.e. `""`).

**Notes**

- To prevent Signal loss, be sure to perform an asynchronous drain on the Signal channel.
  Failure to do so can result in buffered Signals being ignored and lost.
- Make sure that the previous Workflow and the Continue-As-New Workflow are referenced by the same alias.
  Failure to do so can cause the Workflow to Continue-As-New on an entirely different Workflow.

## Timers

A Workflow can set a durable timer for a fixed time period.
In some SDKs, the function is called `sleep()`, and in others, it's called `timer()`.

A Workflow can sleep for months.
Timers are persisted, so even if your Worker or Temporal Cluster is down when the time period completes, as soon as your Worker and Cluster are back up, the `sleep()` call will resolve and your code will continue executing.

Sleeping is a resource-light operation: it does not tie up the process, and you can run millions of Timers off a single Worker.

To set a Timer in Go, use the [`NewTimer()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#NewTimer) function and pass the duration you want to wait before continuing.

```go
timer := workflow.NewTimer(timerCtx, duration)
```

To set a sleep duration in Go, use the [`sleep()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#Sleep) function and pass the duration you want to wait before continuing.
A zero or negative sleep duration causes the function to return immediately.

```go
sleep = workflow.Sleep(ctx, 10*time.Second)
```

For more information, see the [Timer](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/timer) example in the [Go Samples repository](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go).

## Schedule a Workflow

Scheduling Workflows is a crucial aspect of any automation process, especially when dealing with time-sensitive tasks. By scheduling a Workflow, you can automate repetitive tasks, reduce the need for manual intervention, and ensure timely execution of your business processes

Use any of the following action to help Schedule a Workflow Execution and take control over your automation process.

### Create Schedule

Backfilling a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#schedule">Schedule<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule enables the scheduling of Workflow Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#schedule">Learn more</a></span></span></a> executes Actions ahead of the Schedule's specified time range.
This is useful for executing a missed or delayed <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#action">Action<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule enables the scheduling of Workflow Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#action">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, or for testing the <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#">Workflow<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In day-to-day conversations, the term "Workflow" frequently denotes either a Workflow Type, a Workflow Definition, or a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> ahead of time.

To backfill a Schedule in Go, use `Backfill()` on [`ScheduleHandle`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ScheduleClient).
Specify the start and end times to execute the Workflow, along with the <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#overlap-policy">Overlap Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule enables the scheduling of Workflow Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#overlap-policy">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

### Delete Schedule

Deleting a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#schedule">Schedule<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule enables the scheduling of Workflow Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#schedule">Learn more</a></span></span></a> erases a Schedule.
Deletion does not affect any <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#">Workflows<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In day-to-day conversations, the term "Workflow" frequently denotes either a Workflow Type, a Workflow Definition, or a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> started by the Schedule.

To delete a Schedule, use `Delete()` on the `ScheduleHandle`.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/schedule/delete/main_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
func main() {

```

### Describe Schedule

`Describe` retrieves information about the current <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#schedule">Schedule<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule enables the scheduling of Workflow Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#schedule">Learn more</a></span></span></a> configuration.
This can include details about the Schedule <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#spec">Spec<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule enables the scheduling of Workflow Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#spec">Learn more</a></span></span></a> (such as Intervals or CronExpressions) and Schedule State.

To describe a Schedule, use `Describe()` on the `ScheduleHandle`.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/schedule/describe/main_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
func main() {
// ...
	// describe schedule
	scheduleHandle.Describe(ctx)
}
// ...
```

### List Schedules

The `List` action returns a list of existing <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#schedule">Schedules<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule enables the scheduling of Workflow Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#schedule">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and their respective Schedule IDs.

To return information on all Schedules, use [`ScheduleClient.List()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ScheduleClient).

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/schedule/list/main_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
func main() {
// ...
	// list schedules
	listView, _ := temporalClient.ScheduleClient().List(ctx, client.ScheduleListOptions{
		PageSize: 1,
	})
// ...
}
// ...
```

### Pause Schedule

`Pause` and `Unpause` enable the start or stop of all future <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#">Workflow Runs<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In day-to-day conversations, the term "Workflow" frequently denotes either a Workflow Type, a Workflow Definition, or a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> on a given <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#schedule">Schedule<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule enables the scheduling of Workflow Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#schedule">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Pausing a Schedule halts all future Workflow Runs.
Pause a Schedule by setting `State.Paused` to `true`, or by using `Pause()` on the `ScheduleHandle`.

Unpausing a Schedule allows the Workflow to execute as planned.
To unpause a Schedule, use `Unpause()` on the `ScheduleHandle`, or set `State.Paused` to `false`.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/add-go-schedule-sample/schedule/pause/main_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
func main() {
// ...
	scheduleHandle, err := temporalClient.ScheduleClient().Create(ctx, client.ScheduleOptions{
// ...

	})
// ...
	scheduleHandle.Unpause(ctx, client.ScheduleUnpauseOptions{
		Note: "The Schedule has been unpaused.",
	})
	scheduleHandle.Pause(ctx, client.SchedulePauseOptions{

		}, nil
	}

	_ = scheduleHandle.Update(ctx, client.ScheduleUpdateOptions{
		DoUpdate: updateSchedule,
	})
}
// ...
```

## Temporal Cron Jobs

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Temporal Cron Job<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cron Job?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.

A Cron Schedule is provided as an option when the call to spawn a Workflow Execution is made.

Create an instance of [`StartWorkflowOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#StartWorkflowOptions) from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/client` package, set the `CronSchedule` field, and pass the instance to the `ExecuteWorkflow` call.

- Type: `string`
- Default: None

```go
workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
  CronSchedule: "15 8 * * *",
  // ...
}
workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, YourWorkflowDefinition)
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
```

## Side Effects

Side Effects are used to execute non-deterministic code, such as generating a UUID or a random number, without compromising deterministic in the Workflow. This is done by storing the non-deterministic results of the Side Effect into the Workflow [Event History](/workflows/#event-history).

A Side Effect does not re-execute during a Replay. Instead, it returns the recorded result from the Workflow Execution Event History.

Side Effects should not fail. An exception that is thrown from the Side Effect causes failure and retry of the current Workflow Task.

An Activity or a Local Activity may also be used instead of a Side effect, as its result is also persisted in Workflow Execution History.

:::note

You shouldn’t modify the Workflow state inside a Side Effect function, because it is not reexecuted during Replay. Side Effect function should be used to return a value.

:::

Use the [`SideEffect`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#SideEffect) function from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package to execute a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#side-effect">Side Effect<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Side Effect?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Side Effect is a way to execute a short, non-deterministic code snippet, such as generating a UUID, that executes the provided function once and records its result into the Workflow Execution Event History.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#side-effect">Learn more</a></span></span></a> directly in your Workflow.

Pass it an instance of `context.Context` and the function to execute.

The `SideEffect` API returns a Future, an instance of [`converter.EncodedValue`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#SideEffect).

Use the `Get` method on the Future to retrieve the result of the Side Effect.

**Correct implementation**

The following example demonstrates the correct way to use `SideEffect`:

```go
encodedRandom := workflow.SideEffect(ctx, func(ctx workflow.Context) interface{} {
 return rand.Intn(100)
})

var random int
encodedRandom.Get(&random)
// ...
}
```

**Incorrect implementation**

The following example demonstrates how NOT to use `SideEffect`:

```go
// Warning: This is an incorrect example.
// This code is non-deterministic.
var random int
workflow.SideEffect(func(ctx workflow.Context) interface{} {
      random = rand.Intn(100)
      return nil
})
// random will always be 0 in replay, so this code is non-deterministic.
```

On replay the provided function is not executed, the random number will always be 0, and the Workflow Execution could take a different path, breaking determinism.

### Mutable Side Effects

Mutable Side Effects execute the provided function once, and then it looks up the History of the value with the given Workflow ID.

- If there is no existing value, then it records the function result as a value with the given Workflow Id on the History.
- If there is an existing value, then it compares whether the existing value from the History has changed from the new function results, by calling the equals function.
  - If the values are equal, then it returns the value without recording a new Marker Event
  - If the values aren't equal, then it records the new value with the same ID on the History.

:::note

During a Workflow Execution, every new Side Effect call results in a new Marker recorded on the Workflow History; whereas Mutable Side Effects only records a new Marker on the Workflow History if the value for the Side Effect ID changes or is set the first time.

During a Replay, Mutable Side Effects will not execute the function again. Instead, it returns the exact same value that was returned during the Workflow Execution.

:::

To use [`MutableSideEffect()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#MutableSideEffect) in Go, provide a unique name within the scope of the workflow.

```go
if err := workflow.MutableSideEffect(ctx, "configureNumber", get, eq).Get(&number); err != nil {
    panic("can't decode number:" + err.Error())
  }
```

## Namespaces

You can create, update, deprecate or delete your <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Namespaces<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> using either tctl or SDK APIs.

Use Namespaces to isolate your Workflow Executions according to your needs.
For example, you can use Namespaces to match the development lifecycle by having separate `dev` and `prod` Namespaces.
You could also use them to ensure Workflow Executions between different teams never communicate - such as ensuring that the `teamA` Namespace never impacts the `teamB` Namespace.

On Temporal Cloud, use the <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Temporal Cloud UI<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud, use either Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to create and manage a Namespace from the UI, or [tcld commands](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to manage Namespaces from the command-line interface.

On self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you can register and manage your Namespaces using tctl (recommended) or programmatically using APIs. Note that these APIs and tctl commands will not work with Temporal Cloud.

Use a custom <a class="tdlp" href="/security#authorizer-plugin">Authorizer<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Authorizer Plugin?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">undefined</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#authorizer-plugin">Learn more</a></span></span></a> on your Frontend Service in the Temporal Cluster to set restrictions on who can create, update, or deprecate Namespaces.

You must register a Namespace with the Temporal Cluster before setting it in the Temporal Client.

### Register Namespace

Registering a Namespace creates a Namespace on the Temporal Cluster or Temporal Cloud.

On Temporal Cloud, use the <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Temporal Cloud UI<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud, use either Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or [tcld commands](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to create Namespaces.

On self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you can register your Namespaces using tctl (recommended) or programmatically using APIs. Note that these APIs and tctl commands will not work with Temporal Cloud.

Use a custom <a class="tdlp" href="/security#authorizer-plugin">Authorizer<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Authorizer Plugin?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">undefined</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#authorizer-plugin">Learn more</a></span></span></a> on your Frontend Service in the Temporal Cluster to set restrictions on who can create, update, or deprecate Namespaces.

Use [`Register` API](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#NamespaceClient) with the `NamespaceClient` interface to register a <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Namespace<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and set the <a class="tdlp" href="/clusters#retention-period">Retention Period<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retention Period?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retention Period is the amount of time a Workflow Execution Event History remains in the Cluster's persistence store.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/clusters#retention-period">Learn more</a></span></span></a> for the Workflow Execution Event History for the Namespace.

You can also <a class="tdlp" href="/tctl-v1/namespace#register">register Namespaces using the tctl command-line tool<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">tctl namespace register</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">How to register a Namespace using tctl.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tctl-v1/namespace#register">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

```go
client, err := client.NewNamespaceClient(client.Options{HostPort: ts.config.ServiceAddr})
        //...
    err = client.Register(ctx, &workflowservice.RegisterNamespaceRequest{
        Namespace: your-namespace-name,
        WorkflowExecutionRetentionPeriod: &retention,
    })
```

The Retention Period setting using `WorkflowExecutionRetentionPeriod` is mandatory.
The minimum value you can set for this period is 1 day.

Once registered, set Namespace using `Dial` in a Workflow Client to run your Workflow Executions within that Namespace.
See <a class="tdlp" href="/dev-guide/go/foundations#connect-to-temporal-cloud">how to set Namespace in a Client in Go<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to connect to Temporal Cloud</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Use a compatible mTLS CA certificate and mTLS private key and your Cloud Namespace to connect to Temporal Cloud.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dev-guide/go/foundations#connect-to-temporal-cloud">Learn more</a></span></span></a> for details.

Note that Namespace registration using this API takes up to 10 seconds to complete.
Ensure that you wait for this registration to complete before starting the Workflow Execution against the Namespace.

To update your Namespace, use the [`Update` API](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#NamespaceClient) with the `NamespaceClient`.

To update your Namespace using tctl, use the <a class="tdlp" href="/tctl-v1/namespace#update">tctl namespace update<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">tctl namespace update</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">How to update a Namespace using tctl.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tctl-v1/namespace#update">Learn more</a></span></span></a> command.

### Manage Namespaces

You can get details for your Namespaces, update Namespace configuration, and deprecate or delete your Namespaces.

On Temporal Cloud, use the <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Temporal Cloud UI<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To create a Namespace in Temporal Cloud, use either Temporal Cloud UI or tcld.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud#create-a-namespace">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or [tcld commands](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to manage Namespaces.

On self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you can manage your registered Namespaces using tctl (recommended) or programmatically using APIs. Note that these APIs and tctl commands will not work with Temporal Cloud.

Use a custom <a class="tdlp" href="/security#authorizer-plugin">Authorizer<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Authorizer Plugin?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">undefined</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#authorizer-plugin">Learn more</a></span></span></a> on your Frontend Service in the Temporal Cluster to set restrictions on who can create, update, or deprecate Namespaces.

You must register a Namespace with the Temporal Cluster before setting it in the Temporal Client.

On Temporal Cloud, use the [Temporal Cloud UI](/cloud/how-to-manage-namespaces-in-temporal-cloud) or [tcld commands](/cloud/tcld/namespace/) to manage Namespaces.

On self-hosted Temporal Cluster, you can manage your registered Namespaces using tctl (recommended) or programmatically using APIs. Note that these APIs and tctl commands will not work with Temporal Cloud.

- Update information and configuration for a registered Namespace on your Temporal Cluster:

  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace update`](/tctl-v1/namespace#update)
    Example
  - Use the [`UpdateNamespace` API](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#NamespaceClient) to update configuration on a Namespace.
    Example

    ```go
    //...
      err = client.Update(context.Background(), &workflowservice.UpdateNamespaceRequest{
      Namespace:         "your-namespace-name",
      UpdateInfo:        &namespace.UpdateNamespaceInfo{ //updates info for the namespace "your-namespace-name"
          Description:   "updated namespace description",
          OwnerEmail:    "newowner@mail.com",
          //Data:        nil,
          //State:       0,
      },
      /*other details that you can update:
      Config:            &namespace.NamespaceConfig{ //updates the configuration of the namespace with the following options
          //WorkflowExecutionRetentionTtl: nil,
          //BadBinaries:                   nil,
          //HistoryArchivalState:          0,
          //HistoryArchivalUri:            "",
          //VisibilityArchivalState:       0,
          //VisibilityArchivalUri:         "",
      },
      ReplicationConfig: &replication.NamespaceReplicationConfig{ //updates the replication configuration for the namespace
          //ActiveClusterName: "",
          //Clusters:          nil,
          //State:             0,
      },
      SecurityToken:     "",
      DeleteBadBinary:   "",
      PromoteNamespace:  false,
      })*/
    //...
    ```

- Get details for a registered Namespace on your Temporal Cluster:

  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace describe`](/tctl-v1/namespace#describe)
  - Use the [`DescribeNamespace` API](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#NamespaceClient) to return information and configuration details for a registered Namespace.
    Example

    ```go
    //...
      client, err := client.NewNamespaceClient(client.Options{})
      //...
      client.Describe(context.Background(), "default")
    //...
    ```

- Get details for all registered Namespaces on your Temporal Cluster:

  - With tctl: [`tctl namespace list`](/tctl-v1/namespace#list)
  - Use the [`ListNamespace` API](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/f0350f8032ad2f0c60c539b3b61ea37f412f1cf7/temporal/api/operatorservice/v1/service.proto) to return information and configuration details for all registered Namespaces on your Temporal Cluster.
    Example

  ```go
  //...
      namespace.Handler.ListNamespaces(context.Context(), &workflowservice.ListNamespacesRequest{ //lists 1 page (1-100) of namespaces on the active cluster. You can set a large PageSize or loop until NextPageToken is nil
          //PageSize:        0,
          //NextPageToken:   nil,
          //NamespaceFilter: nil,
          })
  //...
  ```

- Delete a Namespace: The [`DeleteNamespace` API](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/f0350f8032ad2f0c60c539b3b61ea37f412f1cf7/temporal/api/operatorservice/v1/service.proto) deletes a Namespace. Deleting a Namespace deletes all running and completed Workflow Executions on the Namespace, and removes them from the persistence store and the visibility store.
  Example:

  ```go
  //...
  client.OperatorService().DeleteNamespace(ctx, &operatorservice.DeleteNamespaceRequest{...
  //...
  ```

## Custom payload conversion

Temporal SDKs provide a <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#payload-converter">Payload Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Payload Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Payload Converter serializes data, converting objects or values to bytes and back.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#payload-converter">Learn more</a></span></span></a> that can be customized to convert a custom data type to <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#payload">Payload<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Payload?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Payload represents binary data such as input and output from Activities and Workflows.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#payload">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and back.

Implementing custom Payload conversion is optional.
It is needed only if the <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#default-data-converter">default Data Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a default Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The default Data Converter is used by the Temporal SDK to convert objects into bytes using a series of Payload Converters.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#default-data-converter">Learn more</a></span></span></a> does not support your custom values.

To support custom Payload conversion, create a <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#custom-payload-conversion">custom Payload Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Payload Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Payload Converter serializes data, converting objects or values to bytes and back.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#custom-payload-conversion">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and configure the Data Converter to use it in your Client options.

The order in which your encoding Payload Converters are applied depend on the order given to the Data Converter.
You can set multiple encoding Payload Converters to run your conversions.
When the Data Converter receives a value for conversion, it passes through each Payload Converter in sequence until the converter that handles the data type does the conversion.

Use [CompositeDataConverter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#CompositeDataConverter) to apply custom, type-specific Payload Converters in a specified order.

`NewCompositeDataConverter` creates a new instance of `CompositeDataConverter` from an ordered list of type-specific Payload Converters.
The following type-specific Payload Converters are available in the Go SDK, listed in the order that they are applied by the default Data Converter:

- [NewNilPayloadConverter()](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#NilPayloadConverter.ToString)
- [NewByteSlicePayloadConverter()](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#ByteSlicePayloadConverter)
- [NewProtoJSONPayloadConverter()](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#ProtoJSONPayloadConverter)
- [NewProtoPayloadConverter()](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#ProtoPayloadConverter)
- [NewJSONPayloadConverter()](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#JSONPayloadConverter)

The order in which the Payload Converters are applied is important because during serialization the Data Converter tries the Payload Converters in that specific order until a Payload Converter returns a non-nil Payload.

A custom [`PayloadConverter`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#PayloadConverter) must implement functions `FromPayload` (for a single value) or `FromPayloads` (for a list of values) to convert to values from a Payload, and `ToPayload` (for a single value) or `ToPayloads` (for a list of values) to convert values to a Payload.

To set your custom Payload Converter, use [`NewCompositeDataConverter`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#NewCompositeDataConverter) and set it as the Data Converter in the Client options.

- To replace the default Data Converter with a custom `NewCompositeDataConverter`, use the following.

  ```go
  dataConverter := converter.NewCompositeDataConverter(YourCustomPayloadConverter())
  ```

- To add your custom type conversion to the default Data Converter, use the following to keep the defaults but set yours just before the default JSON fall through.

  ```go
  dataConverter := converter.NewCompositeDataConverter(
    converter.NewNilPayloadConverter(),
    converter.NewByteSlicePayloadConverter(),
    converter.NewProtoJSONPayloadConverter(),
    converter.NewProtoPayloadConverter(),
    YourCustomPayloadConverter(),
    converter.NewJSONPayloadConverter(),
  )
  ```

## Worker Sessions

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

- This feature is currently available only in the Go SDK.

:::

A Worker Session is a feature that provides a straightforward API for <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#task-routing">Task Routing<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Task Routing?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Task Routing is when a Task Queue is paired with one or more Worker Processes, primarily for Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#task-routing">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to ensure that Activity Tasks are executed with the same Worker without requiring you to manually specify Task Queue names.

### Enable Sessions

Enable the Worker to use Sessions.

Set `EnableSessionWorker` to `true` in the Worker options.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/main/sessions/worker/main_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
// ...
func main() {
// ...
	// Enable Sessions for this Worker.
	workerOptions := worker.Options{
		EnableSessionWorker: true,
// ...
	}
	w := worker.New(temporalClient, "fileprocessing", workerOptions)
	w.RegisterWorkflow(sessions.SomeFileProcessingWorkflow)
	w.RegisterActivity(&sessions.FileActivities{})
	err = w.Run(worker.InterruptCh())
// ...
}
```

#### Max concurrent Sessions

You can adjust the maximum concurrent Sessions of a Worker.

To limit the number of concurrent Sessions running on a Worker, set the `MaxConcurrentSessionExecutionSize` field of `worker.Options` to the desired value.
By default, this field is set to a very large value, so there's no need to manually set it if no limitation is needed.

If a Worker hits this limitation, it won't accept any new `CreateSession()` requests until one of the existing sessions is completed.
If the session can't be created within `CreationTimeout`, `CreateSession()` returns an error .

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/main/sessions/worker/main_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
func main() {
// ...
	workerOptions := worker.Options{
// ...
		// This configures the maximum allowed concurrent sessions.
		// Customize this value only if you need to.
		MaxConcurrentSessionExecutionSize: 1000,
// ...
}
// ...
```

### Create a Session

Within the Workflow code use the Workflow APIs to create a Session with whichever Worker picks up the first Activity Task.

Use the [`CreateSession`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#CreateSession) API to create a Context object that can be passed to calls to spawn Activity Executions.

Pass an instance of `workflow.Context` and [`SessionOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#SessionOptions) to the `CreateSession` API call and get a Session Context that contains metadata information of the Session.

Use the Session Context to spawn all Activity Executions that should belong to the Session.
All associated Activity Tasks are then processed by the same Worker Entity.
When the `CreateSession` API is called, the Task Queue name that is specified in `ActivityOptions` (or in `StartWorkflowOptions` if the Task Queue name is not specified in `ActivityOptions`) is used, and a Session is created with one of the Workers polling that Task Queue.

The Session Context is cancelled if the Worker executing this Session dies or `CompleteSession()` is called.
When using the returned Session Context to spawn Activity Executions, a `workflow.ErrSessionFailed` error is returned if the Session framework detects that the Worker executing this Session has died.
The failure of Activity Executions won't affect the state of the Session, so you still need to handle the errors returned from your Activities and call `CompleteSession()` if necessary.

If the context passed in already contains an open Session, `CreateSession()` returns an error.
If all the Workers are currently busy and unable to handle a new Session, the framework keeps retrying until the `CreationTimeout` period you specified in `SessionOptions` has passed before returning an error.
(For more details, check the "Concurrent Session Limitation" section.)

`CompleteSession()` releases the resources reserved on the Worker, so it's important to call it as soon as you no longer need the Session.
It cancels the session context and therefore all the Activity Executions using that Session Context.
It is safe to call `CompleteSession()` on a failed Session, meaning that you can call it from a `defer` function after the Session is successfully created.

If the Worker goes down between Activities, any scheduled Activities meant for the Session Worker are canceled.
If not, you get a `workflow.ErrSessionFailed` error when the next call of `workflow.ExecuteActivity()` is made from that Workflow.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-go/blob/main/sessions/workflow_dacx.go">View source code</a>

```go
package sessions

import (
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

// ...
// SomeFileProcessingWorkflow is a Workflow Definition.
func SomeFileProcessingWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, param FileProcessingWFParam) error {
	activityOptions := workflow.ActivityOptions{
		StartToCloseTimeout: time.Minute,
	}
	ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, activityOptions)
// ...
	sessionOptions := &workflow.SessionOptions{
		CreationTimeout:  time.Minute,
		ExecutionTimeout: time.Minute,
	}
	// Create a Session with the Worker so that all Activities execute with the same Worker.
	sessionCtx, err := workflow.CreateSession(ctx, sessionOptions)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer workflow.CompleteSession(sessionCtx)
// ...
	err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(sessionCtx, a.DownloadFile, param).Get(sessionCtx, &downloadResult)
// ...
	err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(sessionCtx, a.ProcessFile, processParam).Get(sessionCtx, &processResult)
// ...
	err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(sessionCtx, a.UploadFile, uploadParam).Get(sessionCtx, nil)
// ...
}
```

### Session metadata

```go
type SessionInfo struct {
 // A unique Id for the session
 SessionID         string
 // The hostname of the worker that is executing the session
 HostName          string
 // ... other unexported fields
}

func GetSessionInfo(ctx Context) *SessionInfo
```

The Session Context also stores some Session metadata, which can be retrieved by the `GetSessionInfo()` API.
If the Context passed in doesn't contain any Session metadata, this API will return a `nil` pointer.

### Recreate Session

For long-running Sessions, you may want to use the `ContinueAsNew` feature to split the Workflow into multiple runs when all Activities need to be executed by the same Worker.
The `RecreateSession()` API is designed for such a use case.

```go
func RecreateSession(ctx Context, recreateToken []byte, sessionOptions *SessionOptions) (Context, error)
```

Its usage is the same as `CreateSession()` except that it also takes in a `recreateToken`, which is needed to create a new Session on the same Worker as the previous one.
You can get the token by calling the `GetRecreateToken()` method of the `SessionInfo` object.

```go
token := workflow.GetSessionInfo(sessionCtx).GetRecreateToken()
```

**Is there a complete example?**

Yes, the [file processing example](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/master/fileprocessing) in the [temporalio/samples-go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go) repo has been updated to use the session framework.

**What happens to my Activity if the Worker dies?**

If your Activity has already been scheduled, it will be canceled.
If not, you will get a `workflow.ErrSessionFailed` error when you call `workflow.ExecuteActivity()`.

**Is the concurrent session limitation per process or per host?**

It's per Worker Process, so make sure there's only one Worker Process running on the host if you plan to use this feature.

**Future Work**

- Right now, a Session is considered failed if the Worker Process dies.
  However, for some use cases, you may only care whether the Worker host is alive or not.
  For these use cases, the Session should be automatically re-established if the Worker Process is restarted.

- The current implementation assumes that all Sessions are consuming the same type of resource and there's only one global limitation.
  Our plan is to allow you to specify what type of resource your Session will consume and enforce different limitations on different types of resources.

## Error Handling in Go

An Activity, or a Child Workflow, might fail, and you could handle errors differently based on the different
error cases.

If the Activity returns an error as `errors.New()` or `fmt.Errorf()`, that error is converted into `*temporal.ApplicationError`.

If the Activity returns an error as `temporal.NewNonRetryableApplicationError("error message", details)`, that error is returned as `*temporal.ApplicationError`.

There are other types of errors such as `*temporal.TimeoutError`, `*temporal.CanceledError` and
`*temporal.PanicError`.
Following is an example of what your error code might look like:

Here's an example of handling Activity errors within Workflow code that differentiates between different error types.

```go
err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, YourActivity, ...).Get(ctx, nil)
if err != nil {
	var applicationErr *ApplicationError
	if errors.As(err, &applicationErr) {
		// retrieve error message
		fmt.Println(applicationError.Error())

		// handle Activity errors (created via NewApplicationError() API)
		var detailMsg string // assuming Activity return error by NewApplicationError("message", true, "string details")
		applicationErr.Details(&detailMsg) // extract strong typed details

		// handle Activity errors (errors created other than using NewApplicationError() API)
		switch applicationErr.Type() {
		case "CustomErrTypeA":
			// handle CustomErrTypeA
		case CustomErrTypeB:
			// handle CustomErrTypeB
		default:
			// newer version of Activity could return new errors that Workflow was not aware of.
		}
	}

	var canceledErr *CanceledError
	if errors.As(err, &canceledErr) {
		// handle cancellation
	}

	var timeoutErr *TimeoutError
	if errors.As(err, &timeoutErr) {
		// handle timeout, could check timeout type by timeoutErr.TimeoutType()
        switch err.TimeoutType() {
        case commonpb.ScheduleToStart:
                // Handle ScheduleToStart timeout.
        case commonpb.StartToClose:
                // Handle StartToClose timeout.
        case commonpb.Heartbeat:
                // Handle heartbeat timeout.
        default:
        }
	}

	var panicErr *PanicError
	if errors.As(err, &panicErr) {
		// handle panic, message and stack trace are available by panicErr.Error() and panicErr.StackTrace()
	}
}
```

## Selectors

### Overview

In Go, the `select` statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.
A `select` **blocks until one of its cases can run**, then it executes that case.
It chooses one at random if multiple are ready.

However, a normal Go select statement can not be used inside of Workflows directly because of the random nature.
Temporal's Go SDK `Selector`s are similar and act as a replacement.
They can block on sending and receiving from Channels but as a bonus can listen on Future deferred work.
Usage of Selectors to defer and process work (in place of Go's `select`) are necessary in order to ensure deterministic Workflow code execution (though using `select` in Activity code is fine).

### Full API Example

The API is sufficiently different from `select` that it bears documenting:

```go
func SampleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) error {
	// standard Workflow setup code omitted...

	// API Example: declare a new selector
	selector := workflow.NewSelector(ctx)

	// API Example: defer code execution until the Future that represents Activity result is ready
	work := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ExampleActivity)
	selector.AddFuture(work, func(f workflow.Future) {
		// deferred code omitted...
	})

	// more parallel timers and activities initiated...

	// API Example: receive information from a Channel
	var signalVal string
	channel := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, channelName)
	selector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {
		// matching on the channel doesn't consume the message.
	 	// So it has to be explicitly consumed here
		c.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)
		// do something with received information
	})

	// API Example: block until the next Future is ready to run
	// important! none of the deferred code runs until you call selector.Select
	selector.Select(ctx)

	// Todo: document selector.HasPending
}
```

### Using Selectors with Futures

You usually add `Future`s after `Activities`:

```go
// API Example: defer code execution until after an activity is done
work := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ExampleActivity)
selector.AddFuture(work, func(f workflow.Future) {
	// deferred code omitted...
})
```

`selector.Select(ctx)` is the primary mechanism which blocks on and executes `Future` work.
It is intentionally flexible; you may call it conditionally or multiple times:

```go
	// API Example: blocking conditionally
  if somecondition != nil {
		selector.Select(ctx)
  }

	// API Example: popping off all remaining Futures
  for i := 0; i < len(someArray); i++ {
		selector.Select(ctx) // this will wait for one branch
		// you can interrupt execution here
	}
```

A Future matches only once per Selector instance even if Select is called multiple times.
If multiple items are available, the order of matching is not defined.

#### Using Selectors with Timers

An important use case of futures is setting up a race between a timer and a pending activity, effectively adding a "soft" timeout that doesn't result in any errors or retries of that activity.

For example, [the Timer sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/master/timer) shows how you can write a long running order processing operation where:

- if processing takes too long, we send out a notification email to user about the delay, but we won't cancel the operation
- if the operation finishes before the timer fires, then we want to cancel the timer.

```go
var processingDone bool
f := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, OrderProcessingActivity)
selector.AddFuture(f, func(f workflow.Future) {
	processingDone = true
	// cancel timerFuture
	cancelHandler()
})

// use timer future to send notification email if processing takes too long
timerFuture := workflow.NewTimer(childCtx, processingTimeThreshold)
selector.AddFuture(timerFuture, func(f workflow.Future) {
	if !processingDone {
		// processing is not done yet when timer fires, send notification email
		_ = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, SendEmailActivity).Get(ctx, nil)
	}
})

// wait the timer or the order processing to finish
selector.Select(ctx)
```

We create timers with the `workflow.NewTimer` API.

### Using Selectors with Channels

`selector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {})` is the primary mechanism which receives messages from `Channels`.

```go
// API Example: receive information from a Channel
var signalVal string
channel := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, channelName)
selector.AddReceive(channel, func(c workflow.ReceiveChannel, more bool) {
	c.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)
	// do something with received information
})
```

Merely matching on the channel doesn't consume the message; it has to be explicitly consumed with a `c.Receive(ctx, &signalVal)` call.

### Querying Selector State

You can use the `selector.HasPending` API to ensure that signals are not lost when a Workflow is closed (e.g. by `ContinueAsNew`).

Usage of Selectors is best learned by example:
