:::info WORK IN PROGRESS

This guide is a work in progress.
Some sections may be incomplete or missing for some languages.
Information may change at any time.

If you can't find what you are looking for in the Developer's guide, it could be in [older docs for SDKs](https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/).

:::

This section covers features related to viewing the state of the application, including:

- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [Tracing](#tracing)
- [Logging](#logging)
- [Visibility](#visibility)

## Metrics

Each Temporal SDK is capable of emitting an optional set of metrics from either the Client or the Worker process.
For a complete list of metrics capable of being emitted, see the [SDK metrics reference](/references/sdk-metrics).

Metrics can be scraped and stored in time series databases, such as:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
- [M3db](https://m3db.io/docs/)
- [statsd](https://github.com/statsd/statsd)

Temporal also provides a dashboard you can integrate with graphing services like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/). For more information, see:

- Temporal's implementation of the [Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards)
- [How to export metrics in Grafana](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts#exploring-metrics-via-grafana)

To emit metrics from the Temporal Client in Go, create a [metrics handler](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal/common/metrics#Handler) from the [Client Options](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ClientOptions) and specify a listener address to be used by Prometheus.

```go
client.Options{
		MetricsHandler: sdktally.NewMetricsHandler(newPrometheusScope(prometheus.Configuration{
			ListenAddress: "0.0.0.0:9090",
			TimerType:     "histogram",
		}
```

The Go SDK currently supports the [Tally](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/tally) library; however, Tally offers [extensible custom metrics reporting](https://github.com/uber-go/tally#report-your-metrics), which is exposed through the [`WithCustomMetricsReporter`](/references/server-options#withcustommetricsreporter) API.

For more information, see the [Go sample for metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/metrics).

## Tracing

Tracing allows you to view the call graph of a Workflow along with its Activities and any Child Workflows.

Temporal Web's tracing capabilities mainly track Activity Execution within a Temporal context. If you need custom tracing specific for your use case, you should make use of context propagation to add tracing logic accordingly.

For information about Workflow tracing, see [Tracing Temporal Workflows with DataDog](https://spiralscout.com/blog/tracing-temporal-workflow-with-datadog).

For information about how to configure exporters and instrument your code, see [Tracing Temporal Services with OTEL](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/develop/docs/tracing.md).

The Go SDK provides support for distributed tracing through [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/).
Tracing allows you to view the call graph of a Workflow along with its Activities and any Child Workflows.

Tracing can be configured by providing an [opentracing.Tracer](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go#Tracer)
implementation in [ClientOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ClientOptions) during client instantiation.

For more details on how to configure and leverage tracing, see the [OpenTracing documentation](https://opentracing.io/docs/getting-started/).

The OpenTracing support has been validated using [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), but other implementations mentioned [here](https://opentracing.io/docs/supported-tracers/) should also work.

Tracing functionality utilizes generic context propagation provided by the Client.

## Logging

Send logs and errors to a logging service, so that when things go wrong, you can see what happened.

The SDK core uses `WARN` for its default logging level.

In Workflow Definitions you can use [`workflow.GetLogger(ctx)`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLogger) to write logs.

```go
import (
	"context"
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/activity"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

// Workflow is a standard workflow definition.
// Note that the Workflow and Activity don't need to care that
// their inputs/results are being compressed.
func Workflow(ctx workflow.Context, name string) (string, error) {
// ...

workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)

// Getting the logger from the context.
	logger := workflow.GetLogger(ctx)
// Logging a message with the key value pair `name` and `name`
	logger.Info("Compressed Payloads workflow started", "name", name)

	info := map[string]string{
		"name": name,
	}


	logger.Info("Compressed Payloads workflow completed.", "result", result)

	return result, nil
}
```

### Custom logger

Use a custom logger for logging.

This field sets a custom Logger that is used for all logging actions of the instance of the Temporal Client.

Although the Go SDK does not support most third-party logging solutions natively, [our friends at Banzai Cloud](https://github.com/sagikazarmark) built the adapter package [logur](https://github.com/logur/logur) which makes it possible to use third party loggers with minimal overhead.
Most of the popular logging solutions have existing adapters in Logur, but you can find a full list [in the Logur Github project](https://github.com/logur?q=adapter-).

Here is an example of using Logur to support [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus):

```go
package main
import (
  "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"

	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
	logrusadapter "logur.dev/adapter/logrus"
	"logur.dev/logur"
)

func main() {
  // ...
  logger := logur.LoggerToKV(logrusadapter.New(logrus.New()))
  clientOptions := client.Options{
    Logger: logger,
  }
  temporalClient, err := client.Dial(clientOptions)
  // ...
}
```

## Visibility

The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.

### Search Attributes

The typical method of retrieving a Workflow Execution is by its Workflow Id.

However, sometimes you'll want to retrieve one or more Workflow Executions based on another property. For example, imagine you want to get all Workflow Executions of a certain type that have failed within a time range, so that you can start new ones with the same arguments.

You can do this with <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#search-attribute">Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#search-attribute">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#default-search-attributes">Default Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#default-search-attributes">Learn more</a></span></span></a> like `WorkflowType`, `StartTime` and `ExecutionStatus` are automatically added to Workflow Executions.
- _Custom Search Attributes_ can contain their own domain-specific data (like `customerId` or `numItems`).
  - A few <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#custom-search-attributes">generic Custom Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#custom-search-attributes">Learn more</a></span></span></a> like `CustomKeywordField` and `CustomIntField` are created by default in Temporal's [Docker Compose](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#docker-compose).

The steps to using custom Search Attributes are:

- Create a new Search Attribute in your Cluster using `tctl search-attribute create` or the Cloud UI.
- Set the value of the Search Attribute for a Workflow Execution:
  - On the Client by including it as an option when starting the Execution.
  - In the Workflow by calling `UpsertSearchAttributes`.
- Read the value of the Search Attribute:
  - On the Client by calling `DescribeWorkflow`.
  - In the Workflow by looking at `WorkflowInfo`.
- Query Workflow Executions by the Search Attribute using a <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a>:
  - <a class="tdlp" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">In `tctl`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">tctl workflow list</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">How to list open or closed Workflow Executions using tctl.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
  - In code by calling `ListWorkflowExecutions`.

Here is how to query Workflow Executions:

Use [`Client.ListWorkflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client.ListWorkflow).

### Custom Search Attributes

After you've created custom Search Attributes in your Cluster (using `tctl search-attribute create`or the Cloud UI), you can set the values of the custom Search Attributes when starting a Workflow.

Provide key-value pairs in [`StartWorkflowOptions.SearchAttributes`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#StartWorkflowOptions).

Search Attributes are represented as `map[string]interface{}`.
The values in the map must correspond to the [Search Attribute's value type](/visibility#types):

- Bool = `bool`
- Datetime = `time.Time`
- Double = `float64`
- Int = `int64`
- Keyword = `string`
- Text = `string`

If you had custom Search Attributes `CustomerId` of type Keyword and `MiscData` of type Text, you would provide `string` values:

```go
func (c *Client) CallYourWorkflow(ctx context.Context, workflowID string, payload map[string]interface{}) error {
    // ...
    searchAttributes := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomerId": payload["customer"],
        "MiscData": payload["miscData"]
    }
    options := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
        SearchAttributes:   searchAttributes
        // ...
    }
    we, err := c.Client.ExecuteWorkflow(ctx, options, app.YourWorkflow, payload)
    // ...
}
```

### Upsert Search Attributes

You can upsert Search Attributes to add or update Search Attributes from within Workflow code.

In advanced cases, you may want to dynamically update these attributes as the Workflow progresses.
[UpsertSearchAttributes](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#UpsertSearchAttributes) is used to add or update Search Attributes from within Workflow code.

`UpsertSearchAttributes` will merge attributes to the existing map in the Workflow.
Consider this example Workflow code:

```go
func YourWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, input string) error {

    attr1 := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomIntField": 1,
        "CustomBoolField": true,
    }
    workflow.UpsertSearchAttributes(ctx, attr1)

    attr2 := map[string]interface{}{
        "CustomIntField": 2,
        "CustomKeywordField": "seattle",
    }
    workflow.UpsertSearchAttributes(ctx, attr2)
}
```

After the second call to `UpsertSearchAttributes`, the map will contain:

```go
map[string]interface{}{
    "CustomIntField": 2, // last update wins
    "CustomBoolField": true,
    "CustomKeywordField": "seattle",
}
```

### Remove Search Attribute

To remove a Search Attribute that was previously set, set it to an empty array: `[]`.

**There is no support for removing a field.**

However, to achieve a similar effect, set the field to some placeholder value.
For example, you could set `CustomKeywordField` to `impossibleVal`.
Then searching `CustomKeywordField != 'impossibleVal'` will match Workflows with `CustomKeywordField` not equal to `impossibleVal`, which includes Workflows without the `CustomKeywordField` set.
