The Foundations section of the Temporal Developer's guide covers the minimum set of concepts and implementation details needed to build and run a [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application)—that is, all the relevant steps to start a [Workflow Execution](#develop-workflows) that executes an [Activity](#develop-activities).

In this section you can find the following:

- [Run a development Cluster](#run-a-development-server)
- [Connect to a dev Cluster](#connect-to-a-dev-cluster)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Develop a Workflow](#develop-workflows)
- [Develop an Activity](#develop-activities)
- [Start an Activity Execution](#activity-execution)
- [Run a dev Worker](#run-a-dev-worker)
- [Run a Temporal Cloud Worker](#run-a-dev-worker)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](#start-workflow-execution)

## How to install Temporal CLI and run a development server {#run-a-development-server}

This section describes how to install the [Temporal CLI](/cli) and run a development Cluster.
The local development Cluster comes packaged with the [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui).

For information on deploying and running a production Cluster, see the [Cluster deployment guide](/cluster-deployment-guide), or sign up for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud) and let us run your production Cluster for you.

Temporal CLI is a tool for interacting with a Temporal Cluster from the command line and it includes a distribution of the Temporal Server and Web UI.
This local development Cluster runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies and it supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.

**Install the Temporal CLI**

Choose one of the following install methods to install the Temporal CLI.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">

- Install the Temporal CLI with Homebrew.

  ```bash
  brew install temporal
  ```

  2. Extract the downloaded archive.
  3. Add the `temporal.exe` binary to your PATH.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Start the Temporal Development Server**

Start the Temporal Development Server by using the `server start-dev` command.

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

This command automatically starts the Web UI, creates the default [Namespace](/namespaces), and uses an in-memory database.

The Temporal Server should be available on `localhost:7233` and the Temporal Web UI should be accessible at [`http://localhost:8233`](http://localhost:8233/).

The server's startup configuration can be customized using command line options.
For a full list of options, run:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --help
```

## How to install a Temporal SDK {#install-a-temporal-sdk}

A [Temporal SDK](/temporal#temporal-sdk) provides a framework for [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application) development.

An SDK provides you with the following:

- A [Temporal Client](/temporal#temporal-client) to communicate with a [Temporal Cluster](/clusters#).
- APIs to develop [Workflows](/workflows#).
- APIs to create and manage [Worker Processes](/workers#worker).
- APIs to author [Activities](/activities#activity-definition).

[![Python 3.7+](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/temporalio.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://pypi.org/project/temporalio)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/temporalio.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://pypi.org/project/temporalio)

To install the latest version of the Temporal Python package, run the following command.

```bash
pip install temporalio
```

### How to find the Python SDK API reference {#api-reference}

The Temporal Python SDK API reference is published on [python.temporal.io](https://python.temporal.io/index.html).

### Where are SDK-specific code examples? {#code-samples}

You can find a complete list of executable code samples in [Temporal's GitHub repository](https://github.com/temporalio?q=samples-&type=all&language=&sort=).

Additionally, several of the [Tutorials](https://learn.temporal.io) are backed by a fully executable template application.

- [Python samples library](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python)

## How to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Cluster {#connect-to-a-dev-cluster}

A [Temporal Client](/temporal#temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the [Temporal Cluster](/clusters#).
Communication with a Temporal Cluster includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.

:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.

:::

When you are running a Cluster locally (such as the [Temporal CLI](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#temporal-cli)), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.
Many SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and [Docker Compose](/kb/all-the-ways-to-run-a-cluster#docker-compose) serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py. -->

Use the `connect()` method on the Client class to create and connect to a Temporal Client to the Temporal Cluster.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")

    result = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your name",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
    )

    print(f"Result: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## How to connect to Temporal Cloud {#connect-to-temporal-cloud}

When you connect to [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), you need to provide additional connection and client options that include the following:

- An address that includes your [Cloud Namespace Name](/namespaces#) and a port number: `<Namespace>.<ID>.tmprl.cloud:<port>`.
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates#).

For more information about configuring TLS to secure inter- and intra-network communication for a Temporal Cluster, see [Temporal Customization Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server).

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/connect_cloud_dacx.py. -->

Use the `connect()` method on the Client class to create and connect to a Temporal Client to the Temporal Cluster.
Then specify the [TLSConfig](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.service.TLSConfig.html) arguments to connect to a Temporal Cluster with TLS enabled.
The `client_cert` must be combined with `client_private_key` to authenticate the Client.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/connect_cloud_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio.client import Client, TLSConfig
# ...
# ...
async def main():
    with open("client-cert.pem", "rb") as f:
        client_cert = f.read()
    with open("client-private-key.pem", "rb") as f:
        client_private_key = f.read()
    client = await Client.connect(
        "your-custom-namespace.tmprl.cloud:7233",
        namespace="your-custom-namespace",
        tls=TLSConfig(
            client_cert=client_cert,
            client_private_key=client_private_key,
            # domain=domain, # TLS domain
            # server_root_ca_cert=server_root_ca_cert, # ROOT CA to validate the server cert
        ),
    )
```

## How to develop a basic Workflow {#develop-workflows}

Workflows are the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a [Workflow Definition](/workflows#workflow-definition).

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_workflows_dacx.py. -->

In the Temporal Python SDK programming model, Workflows are defined as classes.

Specify the `@workflow.defn` decorator on the Workflow class to identify a Workflow.

Use the `@workflow.run` to mark the entry point method to be invoked. This must be set on one asynchronous method defined on the same class as `@workflow.defn`. Run methods have positional parameters.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_workflows_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio import workflow
# ...
# ...
@workflow.defn(name="YourWorkflow")
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams("Hello", name),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```

### How to define Workflow parameters {#workflow-parameters}

Temporal Workflows may have any number of custom parameters.
However, we strongly recommend that objects are used as parameters, so that the object's individual fields may be altered without breaking the signature of the Workflow.
All Workflow Definition parameters must be serializable.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_dataobject_dacx.py. -->

Workflow parameters are the method parameters of the singular method decorated with `@workflow.run`.
These can be any data type Temporal can convert, including [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) when properly type-annotated.
Technically this can be multiple parameters, but Temporal strongly encourages a single `dataclass` parameter containing all input fields.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_dataobject_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
# ...
# ...
@dataclass
class YourParams:
    greeting: str
    name: str
```

### How to define Workflow return parameters {#workflow-return-values}

Workflow return values must also be serializable.
Returning results, returning errors, or throwing exceptions is fairly idiomatic in each language that is supported.
However, Temporal APIs that must be used to get the result of a Workflow Execution will only ever receive one of either the result or the error.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_workflows_dacx.py. -->

To return a value of the Workflow, use `return` to return an object.

To return the results of a Workflow Execution, use either `start_workflow()` or `execute_workflow()` asynchronous methods.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_workflows_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio import workflow
# ...
# ...
@workflow.defn(name="YourWorkflow")
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams("Hello", name),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```

### How to customize your Workflow Type {#workflow-type}

Workflows have a Type that are referred to as the Workflow name.

The following examples demonstrate how to set a custom name for your Workflow Type.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_workflows_dacx.py. -->

You can customize the Workflow name with a custom name in the decorator argument. For example, `@workflow.defn(name="your-workflow-name")`. If the name parameter is not specified, the Workflow name defaults to the function name.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_workflows_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio import workflow
# ...
# ...
@workflow.defn(name="YourWorkflow")
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams("Hello", name),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```

### How develop Workflow logic {#workflow-logic-requirements}

Workflow logic is constrained by [deterministic execution requirements](/workflows#deterministic-constraints).
Therefore, each language is limited to the use of certain idiomatic techniques.
However, each Temporal SDK provides a set of APIs that can be used inside your Workflow to interact with external (to the Workflow) application code.

Workflow code must be deterministic. This means:

- no threading
- no randomness
- no external calls to processes
- no network I/O
- no global state mutation
- no system date or time

All API safe for Workflows used in the [`temporalio.workflow`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html) must run in the implicit [`asyncio` event loop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html) and be _deterministic_.

## How to develop a basic Activity {#develop-activities}

One of the primary things that Workflows do is orchestrate the execution of Activities.
An Activity is a normal function or method execution that's intended to execute a single, well-defined action (either short or long-running), such as querying a database, calling a third-party API, or transcoding a media file.
An Activity can interact with world outside the Temporal Platform or use a Temporal Client to interact with a Cluster.
For the Workflow to be able to execute the Activity, we must define the [Activity Definition](/activities#activity-definition).

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/sync-update/your_app/your_activities_dacx.py. -->

You can develop an Activity Definition by using the `@activity.defn` decorator.
Register the function as an Activity with a custom name through a decorator argument, for example `@activity.defn(name="your_activity")`.

:::note

The Temporal Python SDK supports multiple ways of implementing an Activity:

- Asynchronously using [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- Synchronously multithreaded using [`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor)
- Synchronously multiprocess using [`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor) and [`multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager)

Blocking the async event loop in Python would turn your asynchronous program into a synchronous program that executes serially, defeating the entire purpose of using `asyncio`.
This can also lead to potential deadlock, and unpredictable behavior that causes tasks to be unable to execute.
Debugging these issues can be difficult and time consuming, as locating the source of the blocking call might not always be immediately obvious.

Due to this, consider not make blocking calls from within an asynchronous Activity, or use an async safe library to perform
these actions.
If you must use a blocking library, consider using a synchronous Activity instead.

:::

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/sync-update/your_app/your_activities_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio import activity
# ...
# ...
@activity.defn(name="your_activity")
async def your_activity(input: YourParams) -> str:
    return f"{input.greeting}, {input.name}!"
```

### How to develop Activity Parameters {#activity-parameters}

There is no explicit limit to the total number of parameters that an [Activity Definition](/activities#activity-definition) may support.
However, there is a limit to the total size of the data that ends up encoded into a gRPC message Payload.

A single argument is limited to a maximum size of 2 MB.
And the total size of a gRPC message, which includes all the arguments, is limited to a maximum of 4 MB.

Also, keep in mind that all Payload data is recorded in the [Workflow Execution Event History](/workflows#event-history) and large Event Histories can affect Worker performance.
This is because the entire Event History could be transferred to a Worker Process with a [Workflow Task](/workers#workflow-task).

<!--TODO link to gRPC limit section when available -->

Some SDKs require that you pass context objects, others do not.
When it comes to your application data—that is, data that is serialized and encoded into a Payload—we recommend that you use a single object as an argument that wraps the application data passed to Activities.
This is so that you can change what data is passed to the Activity without breaking a function or method signature.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_activities_dacx.py. -->

Activity parameters are the function parameters of the function decorated with `@activity.defn`.
These can be any data type Temporal can convert, including dataclasses when properly type-annotated.
Technically this can be multiple parameters, but Temporal strongly encourages a single dataclass parameter containing all input fields.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_activities_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio import activity
from your_dataobject_dacx import YourParams

# ...
# ...
@activity.defn(name="your_activity")
async def your_activity(input: YourParams) -> str:
    return f"{input.greeting}, {input.name}!"
```

### How to define Activity return values {#activity-return-values}

All data returned from an Activity must be serializable.

There is no explicit limit to the amount of data that can be returned by an Activity, but keep in mind that all return values are recorded in a [Workflow Execution Event History](/workflows#event-history).

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_activities_dacx.py. -->

An Activity Execution can return inputs and other Activity values.

The following example defines an Activity that takes a string as input and returns a string.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_activities_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
@activity.defn(name="your_activity")
async def your_activity(input: YourParams) -> str:
    return f"{input.greeting}, {input.name}!"
```

### How to customize your Activity Type {#activity-type}

Activities have a Type that are referred to as the Activity name.
The following examples demonstrate how to set a custom name for your Activity Type.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_activities_dacx.py. -->

You can customize the Activity name with a custom name in the decorator argument. For example, `@activity.defn(name="your-activity")`.
If the name parameter is not specified, the Activity name defaults to the function name.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_activities_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
@activity.defn(name="your_activity")
async def your_activity(input: YourParams) -> str:
    return f"{input.greeting}, {input.name}!"
```

## How to start an Activity Execution {#activity-execution}

Calls to spawn [Activity Executions](/activities#activity-execution) are written within a [Workflow Definition](/workflows#workflow-definition).
The call to spawn an Activity Execution generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands/#scheduleactivitytask) Command.
This results in the set of three [Activity Task](/workers#activity-task) related Events ([ActivityTaskScheduled](/references/events/#activitytaskscheduled), [ActivityTaskStarted](/references/events/#activitytaskstarted), and ActivityTask[Closed])in your Workflow Execution Event History.

A single instance of the Activities implementation is shared across multiple simultaneous Activity invocations.
Activity implementation code should be _idempotent_.

The values passed to Activities through invocation parameters or returned through a result value are recorded in the Execution history.
The entire Execution history is transferred from the Temporal service to Workflow Workers when a Workflow state needs to recover.
A large Execution history can thus adversely impact the performance of your Workflow.

Therefore, be mindful of the amount of data you transfer through Activity invocation parameters or Return Values.
Otherwise, no additional limitations exist on Activity implementations.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_workflows_dacx.py. -->

To spawn an Activity Execution, use the [`execute_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_activity) operation from within your Workflow Definition.

`execute_activity()` is a shortcut for [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) that waits on its result.

To get just the handle to wait and cancel separately, use `start_activity()`.
In most cases, use `execute_activity()` unless advanced task capabilities are needed.

A single argument to the Activity is positional. Multiple arguments are not supported in the type-safe form of `start_activity()` or `execute_activity()` and must be supplied by the `args` keyword argument.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_workflows_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio import workflow
# ...
# ...
@workflow.defn(name="YourWorkflow")
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams("Hello", name),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```

### How to set the required Activity Timeouts {#required-timeout}

Activity Execution semantics rely on several parameters.
The only required value that needs to be set is either a [Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/activities#start-to-close-timeout) or a [Start-To-Close Timeout](/activities#start-to-close-timeout).
These values are set in the Activity Options.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/activity_timeouts_retires/your_workflows_dacx.py. -->

Activity options are set as keyword arguments after the Activity arguments.

Available timeouts are:

- schedule_to_close_timeout
- schedule_to_start_timeout
- start_to_close_timeout

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/activity_timeouts_retires/your_workflows_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
        activity_timeout_result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams(greeting, "Activity Timeout option"),
            # Activity Execution Timeout
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            # schedule_to_start_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            # schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```

### How to get the results of an Activity Execution {#get-activity-results}

The call to spawn an [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution) generates the [ScheduleActivityTask](/references/commands/#scheduleactivitytask) Command and provides the Workflow with an Awaitable.
Workflow Executions can either block progress until the result is available through the Awaitable or continue progressing, making use of the result when it becomes available.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_workflows_dacx.py. -->

Use [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) to start an Activity and return its handle, [`ActivityHandle`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.ActivityHandle.html). Use [`execute_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_activity) to return the results.

You must provide either `schedule_to_close_timeout` or `start_to_close_timeout`.

`execute_activity()` is a shortcut for `await start_activity()`. An asynchronous `execute_activity()` helper is provided which takes the same arguments as `start_activity()` and `await`s on the result. `execute_activity()` should be used in most cases unless advanced task capabilities are needed.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/your_workflows_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio import workflow
# ...
# ...
@workflow.defn(name="YourWorkflow")
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,

## How to run Worker Processes {#run-a-dev-worker}

The [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) is where Workflow Functions and Activity Functions are executed.

- Each [Worker Entity](/workers#worker-entity) in the Worker Process must register the exact Workflow Types and Activity Types it may execute.
- Each Worker Entity must also associate itself with exactly one [Task Queue](/workers#task-queue).
- Each Worker Entity polling the same Task Queue must be registered with the same Workflow Types and Activity Types.

A [Worker Entity](/workers#worker-entity) is the component within a Worker Process that listens to a specific Task Queue.

Although multiple Worker Entities can be in a single Worker Process, a single Worker Entity Worker Process may be perfectly sufficient.
For more information, see the [Worker tuning guide](/dev-guide/worker-performance).

A Worker Entity contains a Workflow Worker and/or an Activity Worker, which makes progress on Workflow Executions and Activity Executions, respectively.

To develop a Worker, use the `Worker()` constructor and add your Client, Task Queue, Workflows, and Activities as arguments.
The following code example creates a Worker that polls for tasks from the Task Queue and executes the Workflow.
When a Worker is created, it accepts a list of Workflows in the workflows parameter, a list of Activities in the activities parameter, or both.

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.worker import Worker
# ...
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    worker = Worker(
        client,
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        workflows=[YourWorkflow],
        activities=[your_activity],
    )
    await worker.run()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### How to register types {#register-types}

All Workers listening to the same Task Queue name must be registered to handle the exact same Workflows Types and Activity Types.

If a Worker polls a Task for a Workflow Type or Activity Type it does not know about, it fails that Task.
However, the failure of the Task does not cause the associated Workflow Execution to fail.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/run_worker_dacx.py. -->

When a `Worker` is created, it accepts a list of Workflows in the `workflows` parameter, a list of Activities in the `activities` parameter, or both.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/run_worker_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    worker = Worker(
        client,
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        workflows=[YourWorkflow],
        activities=[your_activity],
    )
    await worker.run()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## How to start a Workflow Execution {#start-workflow-execution}

[Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) semantics rely on several parameters—that is, to start a Workflow Execution you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type, language-specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

In the examples below, all Workflow Executions are started using a Temporal Client.
To spawn Workflow Executions from within another Workflow Execution, use either the [Child Workflow](features#child-workflows) or External Workflow APIs.

See the [Customize Workflow Type](#customize-workflow-type) section to see how to customize the name of the Workflow Type.

A request to spawn a Workflow Execution causes the Temporal Cluster to create the first Event ([WorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events/#workflowexecutionstarted)) in the Workflow Execution Event History.
The Temporal Cluster then creates the first Workflow Task, resulting in the first [WorkflowTaskScheduled](/references/events/#workflowtaskscheduled) Event.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py. -->

To start a Workflow Execution in Python, use either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods in the Client.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")

    result = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your name",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
    )

    print(f"Result: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### How to set a Workflow's Task Queue {#set-task-queue}

In most SDKs, the only Workflow Option that must be set is the name of the [Task Queue](/workers#task-queue).

For any code to execute, a Worker Process must be running that contains a Worker Entity that is polling the same Task Queue name.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py. -->

To set a Task Queue in Python, specify the `task_queue` argument when executing a Workflow with either [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) methods.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")

    result = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your name",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
    )

    print(f"Result: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### How to set a Workflow Id {#workflow-id}

Although it is not required, we recommend providing your own [Workflow Id](/workflows#workflow-id) that maps to a business process or business entity identifier, such as an order identifier or customer identifier.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py. -->

To set a Workflow Id in Python, specify the `id` argument when executing a Workflow with either [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) methods.

The `id` argument should be a unique identifier for the Workflow Execution.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")

    result = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your name",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
    )

    print(f"Result: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### How to get the results of a Workflow Execution {#get-workflow-results}

If the call to start a Workflow Execution is successful, you will gain access to the Workflow Execution's Run Id.

The Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace may be used to uniquely identify a Workflow Execution in the system and get its result.

It's possible to both block progress on the result (synchronous execution) or get the result at some other point in time (asynchronous execution).

In the Temporal Platform, it's also acceptable to use Queries as the preferred method for accessing the state and results of Workflow Executions.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/get_workflow_results_dacx.py. -->

Use [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`get_workflow_handle()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle) to return a Workflow handle.
Then use the [`result`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#result) method to await on the result of the Workflow.

To get a handle for an existing Workflow by its Id, you can use [`get_workflow_handle()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle), or use [`get_workflow_handle_for()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle_for) for type safety.

Then use [`describe()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.workflowhandle#describe) to get the current status of the Workflow.
If the Workflow does not exist, this call fails.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_app/get_workflow_results_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")

    handle = client.get_workflow_handle(
        workflow_id="your-workflow-id",
    )
    results = await handle.result()
    print(f"Result: {results}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
