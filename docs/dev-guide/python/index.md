- [**Foundations**](/dev-guide/python/foundations): The minimum things required to build and run a single Activity Workflow.

  - [Run a development Cluster](/dev-guide/python/foundations#run-a-dev-cluster)
  - [Add an SDK to your project](/dev-guide/python/foundations#add-your-sdk)
  - [Create a Temporal Client](/dev-guide/python/foundations#connect-to-a-cluster)
  - [Develop a basic Workflow Definition](/dev-guide/python/foundations#develop-workflows)
  - [Develop a basic Activity Definition](/dev-guide/python/foundations#develop-activities)
  - [Call to execute an Activity](/dev-guide/python/foundations#activity-execution)
  - [Run a Worker Process](/dev-guide/python/foundations#run-worker-processes)
  - [Start a Workflow Execution](/dev-guide/python/foundations#start-workflow-execution)

- [**Features**](/dev-guide/python/features): All the general features available to a Temporal Application.

  - [Signals](/dev-guide/python/features#signals)
  - [Queries](/dev-guide/python/features#queries)
