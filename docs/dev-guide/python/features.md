## Signals

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#signal">Signal<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Signal?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Signal is an asynchronous request to a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#signal">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a message sent to a running Workflow Execution.

Signals are defined in your code and handled in your Workflow Definition.
Signals can be sent to Workflow Executions from a Temporal Client or from another Workflow Execution.

A Signal has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Signal type, is a string.
- The arguments must be serializable.
  To define a Signal, set the Signal decorator [`@workflow.signal`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#signal) on the Signal function inside your Workflow.

**Customize name**

Non-dynamic methods can only have positional arguments.
Temporal suggests taking a single argument that is an object or data class of fields that can be added to as needed.

Return values from Signal methods are ignored.

You can have a name parameter to customize the Signal's name, otherwise it defaults to the unqualified method `__name__`.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/signal_your_workflow/wf_signal_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio import workflow
# ...
# ...
    @workflow.signal
    async def submit_greeting(self, name: str) -> None:
        await self._pending_greetings.put(name)

    @workflow.signal
    def exit(self) -> None:
# ...
    @workflow.signal(name="Custom Signal Name")
    async def custom_signal(self, name: str) -> None:
        await self._pending_greetings.put(name)
```

Workflows listen for Signals by the Signal's name.

To send a Signal to the Workflow, use the [signal](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#signal) method from the [WorkflowHandle](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html) class.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/signal_your_workflow/signal_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
# ...
# ...
    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.submit_greeting, "User 1")
```

### Send Signal from Client

When a Signal is sent successfully from the Temporal Client, the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.

To send a Signal from the Client, use the [signal()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#signal) function on the Workflow handle.

To get the Workflow handle, you can use any of the following options.

- Use the [get_workflow_handle()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle) method.
- Use the [get_workflow_handle_for()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle_for) method to get a type-safe Workflow handle by its Workflow Id.
- Use the [start_workflow()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) to start a Workflow and return its handle.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/signal_your_workflow/signal_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
# ...
# ...
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = await client.start_workflow(
        GreetingWorkflow.run,
        id="your-greeting-workflow",
        task_queue="signal-tq",
    )
    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.submit_greeting, "User 1")
```

### Send Signal from Workflow

A Workflow can send a Signal to another Workflow, in which case it's called an _External Signal_.

When an External Signal is sent:

- A [SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated) Event appears in the sender's Event History.
- A [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the recipient's Event History.

Use [`get_external_workflow_handle_for`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#get_external_workflow_handle_for) to get a typed Workflow handle to an existing Workflow by its identifier.
Use [`get_external_workflow_handle`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#get_external_workflow_handle) when you don't know the type of the other Workflow.

:::note

The Workflow Type passed is only for type annotations and not for validation.

:::

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/signal_your_workflow/signal_external_wf_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
@workflow.defn
class WorkflowB:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        handle = workflow.get_external_workflow_handle_for(WorkflowA.run, "workflow-a")
        await handle.signal(WorkflowA.your_signal, "signal argument")
```

### Signal-With-Start

Signal-With-Start is used from the Client.
It takes a Workflow Id, Workflow arguments, a Signal name, and Signal arguments.

If there's a Workflow running with the given Workflow Id, it will be signaled. If there isn't, a new Workflow will be started and immediately signaled.

To send a Signal-With-Start in Python, use the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) method and pass the `start_signal` argument with the name of your Signal.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/signal_your_workflow/signal_with_start_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
# ...
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    await client.start_workflow(
        GreetingWorkflow.run,
        id="your-signal-with-start-workflow",
        task_queue="signal-tq",
        start_signal="submit_greeting",
        start_signal_args=["User Signal with Start"],
    )
```

## Queries

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#query">Query<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Query?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Query is a synchronous operation that is used to report the state of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#query">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.

### Define Query

A Query has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Query type, is a string.
- The arguments must be <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#">serializable<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

To define a Query, set the Query decorator [`@workflow.query`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#query) on the Query function inside your Workflow.

**Customize names**

You can have a name parameter to customize the Query's name, otherwise it defaults to the unqualified method `__name__`.

:::note

You can either set the `name` or the `dynamic` parameter in a Query's decorator, but not both.

:::

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/query_your_workflow/wf_query_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
    @workflow.query
    def greeting(self) -> str:
        return self._greeting
```

### Handle Query

Queries are handled by your Workflow.

Donâ€™t include any logic that causes <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#command">Command<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Command?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Command is a requested action issued by a Worker to the Temporal Cluster after a Workflow Task Execution completes.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#command">Learn more</a></span></span></a> generation within a Query handler (such as executing Activities).
Including such logic causes unexpected behavior.

To send a Query to the Workflow, use the [`query`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#query) method from the [`WorkflowHandle`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html) class.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/query_your_workflow/query_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
    result = await handle.query(GreetingWorkflow.greeting)
```

### Send Query

Queries are sent from a Temporal Client.

To send a Query to a Workflow Execution from Client code, use the `query()` method on the Workflow handle.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/query_your_workflow/query_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
    result = await handle.query(GreetingWorkflow.greeting)
```

## Workflow timeouts

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when <a class="tdlp" href="#workflow-timeouts">starting the Workflow Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">Workflow timeouts</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#workflow-timeouts">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- **<a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-execution-timeout">Workflow Execution Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Execution Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Execution Timeout is the maximum time that a Workflow Execution can be executing (have an Open status) including retries and any usage of Continue As New.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-execution-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **<a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-run-timeout">Workflow Run Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Run Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">This is the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run is restricted to.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-run-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>**: restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **<a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-task-timeout">Workflow Task Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Task Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Task Timeout is the maximum amount of time that the Temporal Server will wait for a Worker to start processing a Workflow Task after the Task has been pulled from the Task Queue.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-task-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>**: restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

Set the timeout from either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

Available timeouts are:

- `execution_timeout`
- `run_timeout`
- `task_timeout`

```python
handle = await client.start_workflow(
    "your-workflow-name",
    "some arg",
    id="your-workflow-id",
    task_queue="your-task-queue",
    start_signal="your-signal-name",
    # Set Workflow Timeout duration
    execution_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
    # run_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
    # task_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
)
```

```python
handle = await client.execute_workflow(
    "your-workflow-name",
    "some arg",
    id="your-workflow-id",
    task_queue="your-task-queue",
    start_signal="your-signal-name",
    # Set Workflow Timeout duration
    execution_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
    # run_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
    # task_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
)
```

### Workflow retries

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#">Retry Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

Set the Retry Policy from either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

```python
handle = await client.start_workflow(
    "your-workflow-name",
    "some arg",
    id="your-workflow-id",
    task_queue="your-task-queue",
    start_signal="your-signal-name",
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=2)),
)
```

```python
handle = await client.execute_workflow(
    "your-workflow-name",
    "some arg",
    id="your-workflow-id",
    task_queue="your-task-queue",
    start_signal="your-signal-name",
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=2)),
)
```

## Activity timeouts

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **<a class="tdlp" href="/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout">Schedule-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule-To-Close Timeout is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall Activity Execution, from when the first Activity Task is scheduled to when the last Activity Task, in the chain of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution, reaches a Closed status.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>**: is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
- **<a class="tdlp" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Start-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>**: is the maximum time allowed for a single <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Activity Task Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task Execution occurs when a Worker uses the context provided from the Activity Task and executes the Activity Definition.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
- **<a class="tdlp" href="/activities#schedule-to-start-timeout">Schedule-To-Start Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule-To-Start Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule-To-Start Timeout is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an Activity Task is placed in a Task Queue to when a Worker picks it up from the Task Queue.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#schedule-to-start-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>**: is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task">Activity Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task contains the context needed to make an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is scheduled to when a <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#">Worker<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Worker?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In day-to-day conversations, the term Worker is used to denote both a Worker Program and a Worker Process. Temporal documentation aims to be explicit and differentiate between them.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> starts that Activity Task.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

Activity options are set as keyword arguments after the Activity arguments.

Available timeouts are:

- schedule_to_close_timeout
- schedule_to_start_timeout
- start_to_close_timeout

```python
@workflow.defn
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            name,
            schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
            # schedule_to_start_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
            # start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
        )
```

### Activity retries

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#">Retry Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> if a custom one is not provided.

To create an Activity Retry Policy in Python, set the [RetryPolicy](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.common.RetryPolicy.html) class within the [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) or [`execute_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_activity) function.

The following example sets the maximum interval to 2 seconds.

```python
workflow.execute_activity(
    your_activity,
    name,
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=2)),
)
```

### Activity retry simulator

Use this tool to visualize total Activity Execution times and experiment with different Activity timeouts and Retry Policies.

The simulator is based on a common Activity use-case, which is to call a third party HTTP API and return the results.
See the example code snippets below.

Use the Activity Retries settings to configure how long the API request takes to succeed or fail.
There is an option to generate scenarios.
The _Task Time in Queue_ simulates the time the Activity Task might be waiting in the Task Queue.

Use the Activity Timeouts and Retry Policy settings to see how they impact the success or failure of an Activity Execution.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Cluster when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Cluster.

To Heartbeat an Activity Execution in Python, use the [`heartbeat()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.activity.html#heartbeat) API.

```python
@activity.defn
async def your_activity_definition() -> str:
    activity.heartbeat("heartbeat details!")
```

In addition to obtaining cancellation information, Heartbeats also support detail data that persists on the server for retrieval during Activity retry.
If an Activity calls `heartbeat(123, 456)` and then fails and is retried, `heartbeat_details` returns an iterable containing `123` and `456` on the next Run.

#### Heartbeat Timeout

A <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Heartbeat Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Heartbeat Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Heartbeat Timeout is the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> works in conjunction with <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#activity-heartbeat">Activity Heartbeats<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Heartbeat?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster. Each ping informs the Temporal Cluster that the Activity Execution is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#activity-heartbeat">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

[`heartbeat_timeout`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.StartActivityInput.html#heartbeat_timeout) is a class variable for the [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) function used to set the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.

```python
workflow.start_activity(
    activity="your-activity",
    schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
    heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=1),
)
```

`execute_activity()` is a shortcut for [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) that waits on its result.

To get just the handle to wait and cancel separately, use `start_activity()`. `execute_activity()` should be used in most cases unless advanced task capabilities are needed.

```python
workflow.execute_activity(
    activity="your-activity",
    name,
    schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
    heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=1),
)
```

## Asynchronous Activity Completion

<a class="tdlp" href="/activities#asynchronous-activity-completion">Asynchronous Activity Completion<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Asynchronous Activity Completion?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Asynchronous Activity Completion occurs when an external system provides the final result of a computation, started by an Activity, to the Temporal System.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#asynchronous-activity-completion">Learn more</a></span></span></a> enables the Activity Function to return without the Activity Execution completing.

There are three steps to follow:

1. The Activity provides the external system with identifying information needed to complete the Activity Execution.
   Identifying information can be a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#task-token">Task Token<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Task Token?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Task Token is a unique Id that correlates to an Activity Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#task-token">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, or a combination of Namespace, Workflow Id, and Activity Id.
2. The Activity Function completes in a way that identifies it as waiting to be completed by an external system.
3. The Temporal Client is used to Heartbeat and complete the Activity.

To mark an Activity as completing asynchoronus, do the following inside the Activity.

```python
# Capture token for later completion
captured_token = activity.info().task_token
activity.raise_complete_async()
```

To update an Activity outside the Activity, use the [get_async_activity_handle()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_async_activity_handle) method to get the handle of the Activity.

```python
handle = my_client.get_async_activity_handle(task_token=captured_token)
```

Then, on that handle, you can call the results of the Activity, `heartbeat`, `complete`, `fail`, or `report_cancellation` method to update the Activity.

```python
await handle.complete("Completion value.")
```

## Cancel an Activity

Canceling an Activity from within a Workflow requires that the Activity Execution sends Heartbeats and sets a Heartbeat Timeout.
If the Heartbeat is not invoked, the Activity cannot receive a cancellation request.
When any non-immediate Activity is executed, the Activity Execution should send Heartbeats and set a <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Heartbeat Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Heartbeat Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Heartbeat Timeout is the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#heartbeat-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to ensure that the server knows it is still working.

When an Activity is canceled, an error is raised in the Activity at the next available opportunity.
If cleanup logic needs to be performed, it can be done in a `finally` clause or inside a caught cancel error.
However, for the Activity to appear canceled the exception needs to be re-raised.

:::note

Unlike regular Activities, <a class="tdlp" href="/activities#local-activity">Local Activities<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Local Activity?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Local Activity is an Activity Execution that executes in the same process as the Workflow Execution that spawns it.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/activities#local-activity">Learn more</a></span></span></a> can be canceled if they don't send Heartbeats.
Local Activities are handled locally, and all the information needed to handle the cancellation logic is available in the same Worker process.

:::

To cancel an Activity from a Workflow Execution, call the [cancel()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task.cancel) method on the Activity handle that is returned from [start_activity()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity).

```python
@activity.defn
async def cancellable_activity(input: ComposeArgsInput) -> NoReturn:
    try:
        while True:
            print("Heartbeating cancel activity")
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
            activity.heartbeat("some details")
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("Activity cancelled")
        raise


@activity.defn
async def run_activity(input: ComposeArgsInput):
    print("Executing activity")
    return input.arg1 + input.arg2

@workflow.defn
 class GreetingWorkflow:
     @workflow.run
     async def run(self, input: ComposeArgsInput) -> None:
        activity_handle = workflow.start_activity(
            cancel_activity,
            ComposeArgsInput(input.arg1, input.arg2),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
            heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30),
        )
    
        await asyncio.sleep(3)
        activity_handle.cancel()
```

:::note

The Activity handle is a Python task.
By calling `cancel()`, you're essentially requesting the task to be canceled.

## Child Workflows

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#child-workflow">Child Workflow Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Child Workflow Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Child Workflow Execution is a Workflow Execution that is spawned from within another Workflow.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#child-workflow">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a Workflow Execution that is scheduled from within another Workflow using a Child Workflow API.

When using a Child Workflow API, Child Workflow related Events ([StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#startchildworkflowexecutioninitiated), [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted), [ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutioncompleted), etc...) are logged in the Workflow Execution Event History.

Always block progress until the [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted) Event is logged to the Event History to ensure the Child Workflow Execution has started.
After that, Child Workflow Executions may be abandoned using the default _Abandon_ <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Parent Close Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Parent Close Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">If a Workflow Execution is a Child Workflow Execution, a Parent Close Policy determines what happens to the Workflow Execution if its Parent Workflow Execution changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, Timed out).</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Learn more</a></span></span></a> set in the Child Workflow Options.

To be sure that the Child Workflow Execution has started, first call the Child Workflow Execution method on the instance of Child Workflow future, which returns a different future.

Then get the value of an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, which is what waits until the Child Workflow Execution has spawned.

To spawn a Child Workflow Execution in Python, use the [`execute_child_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_child_workflow) function. `execute_child_workflow()` starts the Child Workflow and waits for completion.

```python
await workflow.execute_child_workflow(MyWorkflow.run, "my child arg", id="my-child-id")
```

Alternatively, use the [`start_child_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_child_workflow) function to start a Child Workflow and return its handle. This is useful if you want to do something after it has only started, or to get the workflow/run ID, or to be able to signal it while running. To wait for completion, simply `await` the handle. `execute_child_workflow()` is a helper function for `start_child_workflow()` + `await handle`.

```python
await workflow.start_child_workflow(MyWorkflow.run, "my child arg", id="my-child-id")
```

#### Parent Close Policy

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Parent Close Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Parent Close Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">If a Workflow Execution is a Child Workflow Execution, a Parent Close Policy determines what happens to the Workflow Execution if its Parent Workflow Execution changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, Timed out).</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#parent-close-policy">Learn more</a></span></span></a> determines what happens to a Child Workflow Execution if its Parent changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, or Timed Out).

The default Parent Close Policy option is set to terminate the Child Workflow Execution.

Set the `parent_close_policy` parameter inside the [`start_child_workflow`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_child_workflow) function or the [`execute_child_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_child_workflow) function to specify the behavior of the Child Workflow when the Parent Workflow closes.

```python
async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
    return await workflow.execute_child_workflow(
        ComposeGreeting.run,
        ComposeGreetingInput("Hello", name),
        id="hello-child-workflow-workflow-child-id",
        parent_close_policy=TERMINATE,
    )
```

:::note

`execute_child_workflow()` is a shortcut function for `temporalio.workflow.start_child_workflow()` plus `handle.result()`.

:::

## Continue-As-New

<a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Continue-As-New<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Continue-As-New?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Continue-As-New is the mechanism by which all relevant state is passed to a new Workflow Execution with a fresh Event History.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Learn more</a></span></span></a> enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation if the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.
The Workflow Execution spawned from the use of Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.

To Continue-As-New in Python, call the [`continue_as_new()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#continue_as_new) function from inside your Workflow, which will stop the Workflow immediately and Continue-As-New.

```python
workflow.continue_as_new("your-workflow-name")
```

## Timers

A Workflow can set a durable timer for a fixed time period.
In some SDKs, the function is called `sleep()`, and in others, it's called `timer()`.

A Workflow can sleep for months.
Timers are persisted, so even if your Worker or Temporal Cluster is down when the time period completes, as soon as your Worker and Cluster are back up, the `sleep()` call will resolve and your code will continue executing.

Sleeping is a resource-light operation: it does not tie up the process, and you can run millions of Timers off a single Worker.

To set a Timer in Python, call the [`asyncio.sleep()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#sleeping) function and pass the duration in seconds you want to wait before continuing.

```python
await asyncio.sleep(5)
```

## Schedule a Workflow

Scheduling Workflows is a crucial aspect of any automation process, especially when dealing with time-sensitive tasks. By scheduling a Workflow, you can automate repetitive tasks, reduce the need for manual intervention, and ensure timely execution of your business processes

Use any of the following action to help Schedule a Workflow Execution and take control over your automation process.

### Create

The create action enables you to create a new Schedule. When you create a new Schedule, a unique Schedule ID is generated, which you can use to reference the Schedule in other Schedule commands.

To create a Scheduled Workflow Execution in Python, use the [create_schedule()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#create_schedule)
asynchronous method on the Client.
Then pass the Schedule ID and the Schedule object to the method to create a Scheduled Workflow Execution.
Set the `action` parameter to `ScheduleActionStartWorkflow` to start a Workflow Execution.
Optionally, you can set the `spec` parameter to `ScheduleSpec` to specify the schedule or set the `intervals` parameter to `ScheduleIntervalSpec` to specify the interval.
Other options include: `cron_expressions`, `skip`, `start_at`, and `jitter`.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/schedule_your_workflow/start_schedule_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")

    await client.create_schedule(
        "workflow-schedule-id",
        Schedule(
            action=ScheduleActionStartWorkflow(
                YourSchedulesWorkflow.run,
                "my schedule arg",
                id="schedules-workflow-id",
                task_queue="schedules-task-queue",
            ),
            spec=ScheduleSpec(
                intervals=[ScheduleIntervalSpec(every=timedelta(minutes=2))]
            ),
            state=ScheduleState(note="Here's a note on my Schedule."),
        ),
    )
```

### Backfill

The backfill action executes Actions ahead of their specified time range. This command is useful when you need to execute a missed or delayed Action, or when you want to test the Workflow before its scheduled time.

To Backfill a Scheduled Workflow Execution in Python, use the [backfill()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.ScheduleHandle.html#backfill) asynchronous
method on the Schedule Handle.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/schedule_your_workflow/backfill_schedule_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = client.get_schedule_handle(
        "workflow-schedule-id",
    )
    now = datetime.utcnow()
    await handle.backfill(
        ScheduleBackfill(
            start_at=now - timedelta(minutes=10),
            end_at=now - timedelta(minutes=9),
            overlap=ScheduleOverlapPolicy.ALLOW_ALL,
        ),
    ),
```

### Delete

The delete action enables you to delete a Schedule. When you delete a Schedule, it does not affect any Workflows that were started by the Schedule.

To delete a Scheduled Workflow Execution in Python, use the [delete()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.ScheduleHandle.html#delete) asynchronous method on the Schedule Handle.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/schedule_your_workflow/delete_schedule_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = client.get_schedule_handle(
        "workflow-schedule-id",
    )

    await handle.delete()
```

### Describe

The describe action shows the current Schedule configuration, including information about past, current, and future Workflow Runs. This command is helpful when you want to get a detailed view of the Schedule and its associated Workflow Runs.

To describe a Scheduled Workflow Execution in Python, use the [describe()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.ScheduleHandle.html#delete) asynchronous method on the Schedule Handle.
You can get a complete list of the attributes of the Scheduled Workflow Execution from the [ScheduleDescription](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.ScheduleDescription.html) class.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/schedule_your_workflow/describe_schedule_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = client.get_schedule_handle(
        "workflow-schedule-id",
    )

    desc = await handle.describe()

    print(f"Returns the note: {desc.schedule.state.note}")
```

### List

The list action lists all the available Schedules. This command is useful when you want to view a list of all the Schedules and their respective Schedule IDs.

To list all schedules, use the [list_schedules()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#list_schedules) asynchronous method on the Client.
If a schedule is added or deleted, it may not be available in the list immediately.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/schedule_your_workflow/list_schedule_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main() -> None:
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    async for schedule in await client.list_schedules():
        print(f"List Schedule Info: {schedule.info}.")
```

### Pause

The pause action enables you to pause and unpause a Schedule. When you pause a Schedule, all the future Workflow Runs associated with the Schedule are temporarily stopped. This command is useful when you want to temporarily halt a Workflow due to maintenance or any other reason.

To pause a Scheduled Workflow Execution in Python, use the [pause()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.ScheduleHandle.html#pause) asynchronous method on the Schedule Handle.
You can pass a `note` to the `pause()` method to provide a reason for pausing the schedule.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/schedule_your_workflow/pause_schedule_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = client.get_schedule_handle(
        "workflow-schedule-id",
    )

    await handle.pause(note="Pausing the schedule for now")
```

### Trigger

The trigger action triggers an immediate action with a given Schedule. By default, this action is subject to the Overlap Policy of the Schedule. This command is helpful when you want to execute a Workflow outside of its scheduled time.

To trigger a Scheduled Workflow Execution in Python, use the [trigger()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.ScheduleHandle.html#trigger) asynchronous method on the Schedule Handle.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/schedule_your_workflow/trigger_schedule_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = client.get_schedule_handle(
        "workflow-schedule-id",
    )

    await handle.trigger()
```

### Update

The update action enables you to update an existing Schedule. This command is useful when you need to modify the Schedule's configuration, such as changing the start time, end time, or interval.

Create a function that takes `ScheduleUpdateInput` and returns `ScheduleUpdate`.
To update a Schedule, use a callback to build the update from the description.
The following example updates the Schedule to use a new argument.

<a class="dacx-source-link" href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/schedule_your_workflow/update_schedule_dacx.py">View source code</a>

```python
# ...
    async def update_schedule_simple(input: ScheduleUpdateInput) -> ScheduleUpdate:
        schedule_action = input.description.schedule.action

        if isinstance(schedule_action, ScheduleActionStartWorkflow):
            schedule_action.args = ["my new schedule arg"]
        return ScheduleUpdate(schedule=input.description.schedule)
```

## Temporal Cron Jobs

A <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Temporal Cron Job<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cron Job?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.

A Cron Schedule is provided as an option when the call to spawn a Workflow Execution is made.

You can set each Workflow to repeat on a schedule with the `cron_schedule` option from either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods:

```python
await client.start_workflow(
    "your_workflow_name",
    id="your-workflow-id",
    task_queue="your-task-queue",
    cron_schedule="* * * * *",
)
```
