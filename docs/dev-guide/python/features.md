## How to develop with Signals {#signals}

A [Signal](/workflows#signal) is a message sent to a running Workflow Execution.

Signals are defined in your code and handled in your Workflow Definition.
Signals can be sent to Workflow Executions from a Temporal Client or from another Workflow Execution.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/signal_your_workflow/wf_signal_dacx.py. -->

A Signal has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Signal type, is a string.
- The arguments must be serializable.
  To define a Signal, set the Signal decorator [`@workflow.signal`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#signal) on the Signal function inside your Workflow.

Non-dynamic methods can only have positional arguments.
Temporal suggests taking a single argument that is an object or data class of fields that can be added to as needed.

Return values from Signal methods are ignored.

**Customize names**

You can have a name parameter to customize the Signal's name, otherwise it defaults to the name of the Signal method.

from temporalio import workflow
# ...
# ...
    @workflow.signal
    async def submit_greeting(self, name: str) -> None:
        await self._pending_greetings.put(name)

    @workflow.signal
    def exit(self) -> None:

```

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/signal_your_workflow/signal_dacx.py. -->

Workflows listen for Signals by the Signal's name.

To send a Signal to the Workflow, use the [signal](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#signal) method from the [WorkflowHandle](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html) class.

:::

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
# ...
# ...
    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.submit_greeting, "User 1")
```

### How to send a Signal from a Temporal Client {#send-signal-from-client}

When a Signal is sent successfully from the Temporal Client, the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/signal_your_workflow/signal_dacx.py. -->

To send a Signal from the Client, use the [signal()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#signal) function on the Workflow handle.

To get the Workflow handle, you can use any of the following options.

- Use the [get_workflow_handle()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle) method.
- Use the [get_workflow_handle_for()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle_for) method to get a type-safe Workflow handle by its Workflow Id.
- Use the [start_workflow()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) to start a Workflow and return its handle.

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
# ...
# ...
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")
    handle = await client.start_workflow(
        GreetingWorkflow.run,
        id="your-greeting-workflow",
        task_queue="signal-tq",
    )
    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.submit_greeting, "User 1")
```

### How to send a Signal from a Workflow {#send-signal-from-workflow}

A Workflow can send a Signal to another Workflow, in which case it's called an _External Signal_.

When an External Signal is sent:

- A [SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated) Event appears in the sender's Event History.
- A [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the recipient's Event History.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/signal_your_workflow/signal_external_wf_dacx.py. -->

Use [`get_external_workflow_handle_for`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#get_external_workflow_handle_for) to get a typed Workflow handle to an existing Workflow by its identifier.
Use [`get_external_workflow_handle`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#get_external_workflow_handle) when you don't know the type of the other Workflow.

:::note

The Workflow Type passed is only for type annotations and not for validation.

class WorkflowB:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        handle = workflow.get_external_workflow_handle_for(WorkflowA.run, "workflow-a")
        await handle.signal(WorkflowA.your_signal, "signal argument")
```

### How to Signal-With-Start {#signal-with-start}

Signal-With-Start is used from the Client.
It takes a Workflow Id, Workflow arguments, a Signal name, and Signal arguments.

If there's a Workflow running with the given Workflow Id, it will be signaled. If there isn't, a new Workflow will be started and immediately signaled.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/signal_your_workflow/signal_with_start_dacx.py. -->

To send a Signal-With-Start in Python, use the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) method and pass the `start_signal` argument with the name of your Signal.

        id="your-signal-with-start-workflow",
        task_queue="signal-tq",
        start_signal="submit_greeting",
        start_signal_args=["User Signal with Start"],
    )
```

## How to develop with Queries {#queries}

A [Query](/workflows#query) is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.

### How to define a Query {#define-query}

A Query has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Query type, is a string.
- The arguments must be [serializable](/dataconversion#).

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/query_your_workflow/wf_query_dacx.py. -->

To define a Query, set the Query decorator [`@workflow.query`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#query) on the Query function inside your Workflow.

**Customize names**

You can have a name parameter to customize the Query's name, otherwise it defaults to the name of the Query method.

:::note

You can either set the `name` or the `dynamic` parameter in a Query's decorator, but not both.

:::

:::copycode Sample application code

:::

```python
# ...
    @workflow.query
    def greeting(self) -> str:
        return self._greeting
```

### How to handle a Query {#handle-query}

Queries are handled by your Workflow.

Don’t include any logic that causes [Command](/workflows#command) generation within a Query handler (such as executing Activities).
Including such logic causes unexpected behavior.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/query_your_workflow/query_dacx.py. -->

To send a Query to the Workflow, use the [`query`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#query) method from the [`WorkflowHandle`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html) class.

:::

```python
# ...
    result = await handle.query(GreetingWorkflow.greeting)
```

## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

Workflow timeouts are set when [starting the Workflow Execution](#workflow-timeouts).

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/workflows#workflow-execution-timeout)** - restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Execution can be executed.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/workflows#workflow-run-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a single Workflow Run can last.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/workflows#workflow-task-timeout):** restricts the maximum amount of time that a Worker can execute a Workflow Task.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/workflow_timeouts_retries/workflows_dacx.py. -->

Set the timeout to either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

Available timeouts are:

- `execution_timeout`
- `run_timeout`
- `task_timeout`

:::copycode Sample application code

:::

```python
# ...
    result = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your timeout argument",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        # Set Workflow Timeout duration
        execution_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
        # run_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
        # task_timeout=timedelta(seconds=2),
    )
```

### Workflow retries {#workflow-retries}

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/retry-policies#) to retry a Workflow Execution in the event of a failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/workflow_timeouts_retries/workflows_dacx.py. -->

Set the Retry Policy to either the [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or [`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods.

# ...
    handle = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your retry policy argument",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
        retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=2)),
    )
```

## How to set Activity timeouts {#activity-timeouts}

Each Activity timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of an Activity Execution.

The following timeouts are available in the Activity Options.

- **[Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/activities#schedule-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution).
- **[Start-To-Close Timeout](/activities#start-to-close-timeout):** is the maximum time allowed for a single [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution).
- **[Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/activities#schedule-to-start-timeout):** is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an [Activity Task](/workers#activity-task) is scheduled to when a [Worker](/workers#worker) starts that Activity Task.

An Activity Execution must have either the Start-To-Close or the Schedule-To-Close Timeout set.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/activity_timeouts_retires/your_workflows_dacx.py. -->

Activity options are set as keyword arguments after the Activity arguments.

Available timeouts are:

- schedule_to_close_timeout
- schedule_to_start_timeout
- start_to_close_timeout

:::copycode Sample application code

The following code sample comes from a working and tested sample application.

```python
# ...
        activity_timeout_result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams(greeting, "Activity Timeout option"),
            # Activity Execution Timeout
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            # schedule_to_start_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            # schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
        )
```

### How to set an Activity Retry Policy {#activity-retries}

A Retry Policy works in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Activity Executions are automatically associated with a default [Retry Policy](/retry-policies#) if a custom one is not provided.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/activity_timeouts_retires/your_workflows_dacx.py. -->

To create an Activity Retry Policy in Python, set the [RetryPolicy](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.common.RetryPolicy.html) class within the [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) or [`execute_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_activity) function.

from temporalio.common import RetryPolicy
# ...
        activity_result = await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity,
            YourParams(greeting, "Retry Policy options"),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
            # Retry Policy
            retry_policy=RetryPolicy(
                backoff_coefficient=2.0,
                maximum_attempts=5,
                initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=1),
                maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=2),
                # non_retryable_error_types=["ValueError"],
            ),
        )
```

## How to Heartbeat an Activity {#activity-heartbeats}

An [Activity Heartbeat](/activities#activity-heartbeat) is a ping from the [Worker Process](/workers#worker-process) that is executing the Activity to the [Temporal Cluster](/clusters#).
Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Cluster that the [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution) is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.
If the Cluster does not receive a Heartbeat within a [Heartbeat Timeout](/activities#heartbeat-timeout) time period, the Activity will be considered failed and another [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution) may be scheduled according to the Retry Policy.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Cluster—they may be [throttled](/activities#throttling) by the Worker.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Cluster when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

Heartbeats can contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress.
If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last Heartbeat that was sent to the Cluster.

To Heartbeat an Activity Execution in Python, use the [`heartbeat()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.activity.html#heartbeat) API.

```python
@activity.defn
async def your_activity_definition() -> str:
    activity.heartbeat("heartbeat details!")
```

In addition to obtaining cancellation information, Heartbeats also support detail data that persists on the server for retrieval during Activity retry.
If an Activity calls `heartbeat(123, 456)` and then fails and is retried, `heartbeat_details` returns an iterable containing `123` and `456` on the next Run.

#### How to set a Heartbeat Timeout {#heartbeat-timeout}

A [Heartbeat Timeout](/activities#heartbeat-timeout) works in conjunction with [Activity Heartbeats](/activities#activity-heartbeat).

[`heartbeat_timeout`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.StartActivityInput.html#heartbeat_timeout) is a class variable for the [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) function used to set the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.

```python
workflow.start_activity(
    activity="your-activity",
    schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
    heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=1),
)
```

`execute_activity()` is a shortcut for [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) that waits on its result.

To get just the handle to wait and cancel separately, use `start_activity()`. `execute_activity()` should be used in most cases unless advanced task capabilities are needed.

```python
workflow.execute_activity(
    activity="your-activity",
    name,
    schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
    heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=1),
)
```

## How to asynchronously complete an Activity {#asynchronous-activity-completion}

[Asynchronous Activity Completion](/activities#asynchronous-activity-completion) enables the Activity Function to return without the Activity Execution completing.

There are three steps to follow:

1. The Activity provides the external system with identifying information needed to complete the Activity Execution.
   Identifying information can be a [Task Token](/activities#task-token), or a combination of Namespace, Workflow Id, and Activity Id.
2. The Activity Function completes in a way that identifies it as waiting to be completed by an external system.
3. The Temporal Client is used to Heartbeat and complete the Activity.

To mark an Activity as completing asynchoronus, do the following inside the Activity.

```python
# Capture token for later completion
captured_token = activity.info().task_token
activity.raise_complete_async()
```

To update an Activity outside the Activity, use the [get_async_activity_handle()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_async_activity_handle) method to get the handle of the Activity.

```python
handle = my_client.get_async_activity_handle(task_token=captured_token)
```

Then, on that handle, you can call the results of the Activity, `heartbeat`, `complete`, `fail`, or `report_cancellation` method to update the Activity.

```python
await handle.complete("Completion value.")
```

## Cancel an Activity from a Workflow {#cancel-an-activity}

Canceling an Activity from within a Workflow requires that the Activity Execution sends Heartbeats and sets a Heartbeat Timeout.
If the Heartbeat is not invoked, the Activity cannot receive a cancellation request.
When any non-immediate Activity is executed, the Activity Execution should send Heartbeats and set a [Heartbeat Timeout](/activities#heartbeat-timeout) to ensure that the server knows it is still working.

When an Activity is canceled, an error is raised in the Activity at the next available opportunity.
If cleanup logic needs to be performed, it can be done in a `finally` clause or inside a caught cancel error.
However, for the Activity to appear canceled the exception needs to be re-raised.

:::note

Unlike regular Activities, [Local Activities](/activities#local-activity) can be canceled if they don't send Heartbeats.
Local Activities are handled locally, and all the information needed to handle the cancellation logic is available in the same Worker process.

:::

To cancel an Activity from a Workflow Execution, call the [cancel()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task.cancel) method on the Activity handle that is returned from [start_activity()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity).

```python
@activity.defn
async def cancellable_activity(input: ComposeArgsInput) -> NoReturn:
    try:
        while True:
            print("Heartbeating cancel activity")
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
            activity.heartbeat("some details")
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("Activity cancelled")
        raise


@activity.defn
async def run_activity(input: ComposeArgsInput):
    print("Executing activity")
    return input.arg1 + input.arg2

@workflow.defn
 class GreetingWorkflow:
     @workflow.run
     async def run(self, input: ComposeArgsInput) -> None:
        activity_handle = workflow.start_activity(
            cancel_activity,
            ComposeArgsInput(input.arg1, input.arg2),
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
            heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30),
        )
    
        await asyncio.sleep(3)
        activity_handle.cancel()
```

:::note

The Activity handle is a Python task.
By calling `cancel()`, you're essentially requesting the task to be canceled.

## How to interrupt a Workflow Execution {#interrupt-a-workflow-execution}

You can interrupt a Workflow Execution in one of the following ways:

- [Cancel](#cancel)
- [Terminate](#terminate)

The following are the main differences between canceling and terminating a Workflow in Temporal:

##### Cancel

Canceling a Workflow provides a graceful way to stop Workflow Execution.
This action resembles sending a `SIGTERM` to a process.

- The system records a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in the Workflow History.
- A Workflow Task gets scheduled to process the cancelation.
- The Workflow code can handle the cancelation and execute any cleanup logic.
- The system doesn't forcefully stop the Workflow.

For more information, see [How to cancel a Workflow Execution](#cancel-a-workflow-execution).

##### Terminate

Terminating a Workflow forcefully stops Workflow Execution.
This action resembles killing a process.

- The system records a `WorkflowExecutionTerminated` event in the Workflow History.
- The termination forcefully and immediately stops the Workflow Execution.
- The Workflow code gets no chance to handle termination.
- A Workflow Task doesn't get scheduled.

For more information, see [How to terminate a Workflow Execution](#terminate-a-workflow-execution).

##### Summary

In summary:

- Canceling provides a graceful way to stop the Workflow and allows it to handle cancelation logic.
- Termination forcefully stops the Workflow and prevents any further events.

In most cases, canceling is preferable because it allows the Workflow to finish gracefully.
Terminate only if the Workflow is stuck and cannot be canceled normally.

### How to cancel a Workflow Execution in Python {#cancel-a-workflow-execution}

To cancel a Workflow Execution in Python, use the [cancel()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#cancel) function on the Workflow handle.

```python
await client.get_workflow_handle("your_workflow_id").cancel()
```

### How to terminate a Workflow Execution in Python {#terminate-a-workflow-execution}

To terminate a Workflow Execution in Python, use the [terminate()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#terminate) function on the Workflow handle.

```python
await client.get_workflow_handle("your_workflow_id").terminate()
```

## How to start a Child Workflow Execution {#child-workflows}

A [Child Workflow Execution](/workflows#child-workflow) is a Workflow Execution that is scheduled from within another Workflow using a Child Workflow API.

When using a Child Workflow API, Child Workflow related Events ([StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#startchildworkflowexecutioninitiated), [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted), [ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutioncompleted), etc...) are logged in the Workflow Execution Event History.

Always block progress until the [ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#childworkflowexecutionstarted) Event is logged to the Event History to ensure the Child Workflow Execution has started.
After that, Child Workflow Executions may be abandoned using the default _Abandon_ [Parent Close Policy](/workflows#parent-close-policy) set in the Child Workflow Options.

To be sure that the Child Workflow Execution has started, first call the Child Workflow Execution method on the instance of Child Workflow future, which returns a different future.

Then get the value of an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, which is what waits until the Child Workflow Execution has spawned.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_child_workflow/your_child_workflow_dacx.py. -->

To spawn a Child Workflow Execution in Python, use the [`execute_child_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_child_workflow) function which starts the Child Workflow and waits for completion or
use the [`start_child_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_child_workflow) function to start a Child Workflow and return its handle.
This is useful if you want to do something after it has only started, or to get the Workflow/Run ID, or to be able to signal it while running.

:::note

`execute_child_workflow()` is a helper function for `start_child_workflow()` plus `await handle`.

#### How to set a Parent Close Policy {#parent-close-policy}

A [Parent Close Policy](/workflows#parent-close-policy) determines what happens to a Child Workflow Execution if its Parent changes to a Closed status (Completed, Failed, or Timed Out).

The default Parent Close Policy option is set to terminate the Child Workflow Execution.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/your_child_workflow/your_child_workflow_dacx.py. -->

Set the `parent_close_policy` parameter inside the [`start_child_workflow`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_child_workflow) function or the [`execute_child_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_child_workflow) function to specify the behavior of the Child Workflow when the Parent Workflow closes.

## How to Continue-As-New {#continue-as-new}

[Continue-As-New](/workflows#continue-as-new) enables a Workflow Execution to close successfully and create a new Workflow Execution in a single atomic operation if the number of Events in the Event History is becoming too large.
The Workflow Execution spawned from the use of Continue-As-New has the same Workflow Id, a new Run Id, and a fresh Event History and is passed all the appropriate parameters.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/continue_as_new/your_workflows_dacx.py. -->

To Continue-As-New in Python, call the [`continue_as_new()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#continue_as_new) function from inside your Workflow, which will stop the Workflow immediately and Continue-As-New.

        await asyncio.sleep(10)
        workflow.continue_as_new(iteration + 1)
```

## What is a Timer? {#timers}

A Workflow can set a durable timer for a fixed time period.
In some SDKs, the function is called `sleep()`, and in others, it's called `timer()`.

A Workflow can sleep for months.
Timers are persisted, so even if your Worker or Temporal Cluster is down when the time period completes, as soon as your Worker and Cluster are back up, the `sleep()` call will resolve and your code will continue executing.

Sleeping is a resource-light operation: it does not tie up the process, and you can run millions of Timers off a single Worker.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
THIS FILE IS GENERATED from https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python/blob/main/continue_as_new/your_workflows_dacx.py. -->

To set a Timer in Python, call the [`asyncio.sleep()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#sleeping) function and pass the duration in seconds you want to wait before continuing.

## How to Schedule a Workflow {#schedule-a-workflow}

Scheduling Workflows is a crucial aspect of any automation process, especially when dealing with time-sensitive tasks. By scheduling a Workflow, you can automate repetitive tasks, reduce the need for manual intervention, and ensure timely execution of your business processes

Use any of the following action to help Schedule a Workflow Execution and take control over your automation process.

### How to Create a Scheduled Workflow {#create}

The create action enables you to create a new Schedule. When you create a new Schedule, a unique Schedule ID is generated, which you can use to reference the Schedule in other Schedule commands.

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
