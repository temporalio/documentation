Welcome to Temporal Python SDK developer's guide!

:::info Temporal Python SDK API reference

[python.temporal.io](https://python.temporal.io/)

:::

The Temporal Python SDK released on March 18, 2022.
The Python SDK provides access to the Temporal programming model using idiomatic Python programming paradigms.

### What Python programming skills and experiences are useful when using the Python SDK? {#skills}

You can start working with the SDK with only Python knowledge.
Temporal abstracts much of the complexity of distributed systems, but to unlock its full potential, having a broad base of knowledge will help you design more efficient and resilient systems.

We recommend that developers possess at least a moderate level of experience in practicing the following skills to develop production-level Temporal Applications:

#### Basic Knowledge

- Python syntax and structure
- Data types
- Control Statements (Loops, Conditionals)
- Functions
- Decorators
- [Data Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)

#### Development Environment

- IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) for version control
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for package management

#### Object-Oriented Programming

- Classes and objects
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

For complex and large-scale use cases, having some experience with the following could be helpful:

#### Advanced Language Features

- [Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and custom `asyncio` event loop
- Exception handling
- List comprehensions
- Type safety (with [type hints](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) or [annotations](https://peps.python.org/pep-3107/))
- Threads and concurrency

#### Asynchronous Programming

- [Shielding from cancellation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#shielding-from-cancellation)
- Different Activity Types
  - [Run in executor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor)
  - [ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor)
  - [ProcessPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor)

#### Testing and Debugging

- [Pytest](https://pytest.org) or other testing frameworks
- Temporal test server
- Basic profiling and debugging
- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or other type checkers

#### Design Patterns

- Dependency injections
- Sagas

#### Databases

- Familiarity with SQL or NoSQL databases
- Database connection and queries in Python

#### Software Architecture & Design

- Software system design and architecture
- Distributed systems and scalability
  - Event-driven architectures
  - Stateful vs stateless processes
  - Scalability implications
  - Fault tolerance

#### Security

- Handling PII and sensitive information
- Encryption and secure coding practices

### Where can I find code samples? {#samples}

Code samples are integrated into this developer’s guide.
You can find those code samples in the [temporalio/documentation-samples-python](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation-samples-python) repository on GitHub.

Additional Python code samples are in the [temporalio/samples-python](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python) repository on GitHub.
