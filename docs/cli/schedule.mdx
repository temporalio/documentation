This page provides a reference for the `temporal` CLI `schedule` command. The flags applicable to each subcommand are presented in a table within the heading for the subcommand. Refer to [Global Flags](#global-flags) for flags that you can use with every subcommand.

## backfill

Batch-execute actions that would have run during a specified time interval.
Use this command to fill in Workflow runs from when a Schedule was paused,
before a Schedule was created, from the future, or to re-process a previously
executed interval.

Backfills require a Schedule ID and the time period covered by the request.
It's best to use the `BufferAll` or `AllowAll` policies to avoid conflicts
and ensure no Workflow Executions are skipped.

For example:

```
temporal schedule backfill \
    --schedule-id "YourScheduleId" \
    --start-time "2022-05-01T00:00:00Z" \
    --end-time "2022-05-31T23:59:59Z" \
    --overlap-policy BufferAll
```

The policies include:

* **AllowAll**: Allow unlimited concurrent Workflow Executions. This
  significantly speeds up the backfilling process on systems that support
  concurrency. You must ensure running Workflow Executions do not interfere
  with each other.
* **BufferAll**: Buffer all incoming Workflow Executions while waiting for
  the running Workflow Execution to complete.
* **Skip**: If a previous Workflow Execution is still running, discard new
  Workflow Executions.
* **BufferOne**: Same as 'Skip' but buffer a single Workflow Execution to be
  run after the previous Execution completes. Discard other Workflow
  Executions.
* **CancelOther**: Cancel the running Workflow Execution and replace it with
  the incoming new Workflow Execution.
* **TerminateOther**: Terminate the running Workflow Execution and replace
  it with the incoming new Workflow Execution.

Use the following options to change the behavior of this command. You can also use any of the [global flags](#global-flags) that apply to all subcommands.

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--end-time` | Yes | **timestamp** Backfill end time. |
| `--overlap-policy` | No | **string-enum** Policy for handling overlapping Workflow Executions. Accepted values: Skip, BufferOne, BufferAll, CancelOther, TerminateOther, AllowAll. |
| `--schedule-id`, `-s` | Yes | **string** Schedule ID. |
| `--start-time` | Yes | **timestamp** Backfill start time. |

## create

Create a new Schedule on the Temporal Service. A Schedule automatically starts
new Workflow Executions at the times you specify.

For example:

```
  temporal schedule create \
    --schedule-id "YourScheduleId" \
    --calendar '{"dayOfWeek":"Fri","hour":"3","minute":"30"}' \
    --workflow-id YourBaseWorkflowIdName \
    --task-queue YourTaskQueue \
    --type YourWorkflowType
```

Schedules support any combination of `--calendar`, `--interval`, and `--cron`:

* Shorthand `--interval` strings.
  For example: 45m (every 45 minutes) or 6h/5h (every 6 hours, at the top of
  the 5th hour).
* JSON `--calendar`, as in the preceding example.
* Unix-style `--cron` strings and robfig declarations
  (@daily/@weekly/@every X/etc).
  For example, every Friday at 12:30 PM: `30 12 * * Fri`.

## delete

Removing a Schedule won't affect the Workflow Executions it started that are
still running. To cancel or terminate these Workflow Executions, use `temporal
workflow delete` with the `TemporalScheduledById` Search Attribute instead.

```

and

```
temporal schedule toggle
    --schedule-id "YourScheduleId" \
    --unpause \
    --reason "YourReason"
```

The `--reason` text updates the Schedule's `notes` field for operations
communication. It defaults to "(no reason provided)" if omitted. This field is
