This page provides a reference for the `temporal` CLI `activity` command. The flags applicable to each subcommand are presented in a table within the heading for the subcommand. Refer to [Global Flags](#global-flags) for flags that you can use with every subcommand.

## complete

Complete an Activity, marking it as successfully finished. Specify the
Activity ID and include a JSON result for the returned value:

```
temporal activity complete \
    --activity-id YourActivityId \
    --workflow-id YourWorkflowId \
    --result '{"YourResultKey": "YourResultVal"}'
```

Use the following options to change the behavior of this command.

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--activity-id` | Yes | **string** Activity ID to complete. |
| `--result` | Yes | **string** Result `JSON` to return. |
| `--run-id`, `-r` | No | **string** Run ID. |
| `--workflow-id`, `-w` | Yes | **string** Workflow ID. |

## fail

Fail an Activity, marking it as having encountered an error. Specify the
Activity and Workflow IDs:

```
temporal activity fail \
    --activity-id YourActivityId \
    --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
```

Use the following options to change the behavior of this command.

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--activity-id` | Yes | **string** Activity ID to fail. |
| `--detail` | No | **string** Reason for failing the Activity (JSON). |
| `--reason` | No | **string** Reason for failing the Activity. |
| `--run-id`, `-r` | No | **string** Run ID. |
| `--workflow-id`, `-w` | Yes | **string** Workflow ID. |

## pause

Pause an Activity.

If the Activity is not currently running (e.g. because it previously
failed), it will not be run again until it is unpaused.

However, if the Activity is currently running, it will run until the next
time it fails, completes, or times out, at which point the pause will kick in.

If the Activity is on its last retry attempt and fails, the failure will
be returned to the caller, just as if the Activity had not been paused.

Activities should be specified either by their Activity ID or Activity Type.

For example, specify the Activity and Workflow IDs like this:

```
temporal activity pause \
    --activity-id YourActivityId \
    --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
```

To later unpause the activity, see [unpause](#unpause). You may also want to
[reset](#reset) the activity to unpause it while also starting it from the beginning.

Use the following options to change the behavior of this command.

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--activity-id`, `-a` | No | **string** The Activity ID to pause. Either `activity-id` or `activity-type` must be provided, but not both. |
| `--activity-type` | No | **string** All activities of the Activity Type will be paused. Either `activity-id` or `activity-type` must be provided, but not both. Note: Pausing Activity by Type is an experimental feature and may change in the future. |
| `--identity` | No | **string** The identity of the user or client submitting this request. |
| `--run-id`, `-r` | No | **string** Run ID. |
| `--workflow-id`, `-w` | Yes | **string** Workflow ID. |

## reset

Reset an activity. This restarts the activity as if it were first being
scheduled. That is, it will reset both the number of attempts and the
activity timeout, as well as, optionally, the
[heartbeat details](#reset-heartbeats).

If the activity may be executing (i.e. it has not yet timed out), the
reset will take effect the next time it fails, heartbeats, or times out.
If is waiting for a retry (i.e. has failed or timed out), the reset
will apply immediately.

If the activity is already paused, it will be unpaused by default.
You can specify `keep_paused` to prevent this.

If the activity is paused and the `keep_paused` flag is not provided,
it will be unpaused. If the activity is paused and `keep_paused` flag
is provided - it will stay paused.

Activities can be specified by their Activity ID or Activity Type.

### Resetting activities that heartbeat {#reset-heartbeats}

Activities that heartbeat will receive a [Canceled failure](/references/failures#cancelled-failure)
the next time they heartbeat after a reset.

If, in your Activity, you need to do any cleanup when an Activity is
reset, handle this error and then re-throw it when you've cleaned up.

If the `reset_heartbeats` flag is set, the heartbeat details will also be cleared.

Specify the Activity Type of ID and Workflow IDs:

```
temporal activity reset \
    --activity-id YourActivityId \
    --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
    --keep-paused
    --reset-heartbeats
```

Either `activity-id`, `activity-type`, or `--match-all` must be specified.

Activities can be reset in bulk with a visibility query list filter. 
For example, if you want to reset activities of type Foo:

```
temporal activity reset \
    --query 'TemporalResetInfo="property:activityType=Foo"'
```

Use the following options to change the behavior of this command.

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--activity-id`, `-a` | No | **string** The Activity ID to reset.  Mutually exclusive with `--query`, `--match-all`, and `--activity-type`. Requires `--workflow-id` to be specified. |
| `--activity-type` | No | **string** Activities of this Type will be reset. Mutually exclusive with `--match-all` and `activity-id`. |
| `--jitter` | No | **duration** The activity will reset at random a time within the specified duration. Can only be used with --query. |
| `--keep-paused` | No | **bool** If the activity was paused, it will stay paused. |
| `--match-all` | No | **bool** Every activity should be reset. Every activity should be updated. Mutually exclusive with `--activity-id` and `--activity-type`. |
| `--query`, `-q` | No | **string** Content for an SQL-like `QUERY` List Filter. You must set either --workflow-id or --query. |
| `--reason` | No | **string** Reason for batch operation. Only use with --query. Defaults to user name. |
| `--reset-attempts` | No | **bool** Reset the activity attempts. |
| `--reset-heartbeats` | No | **bool** Reset the Activity's heartbeats. Only works with --reset-attempts. |
| `--restore-original-options` | No | **bool** Restore the original options of the activity. |
| `--rps` | No | **float** Limit batch's requests per second. Only allowed if query is present. |
| `--run-id`, `-r` | No | **string** Run ID. Only use with --workflow-id. Cannot use with --query. |
| `--workflow-id`, `-w` | No | **string** Workflow ID. You must set either --workflow-id or --query. |
| `--yes`, `-y` | No | **bool** Don't prompt to confirm signaling. Only allowed when --query is present. |

## unpause

Re-schedule a previously-paused Activity for execution.

If the Activity is not running and is past its retry timeout, it will be
scheduled immediately. Otherwise, it will be scheduled after its retry
timeout expires.

Use `--reset-attempts` to reset the number of previous run attempts to
zero. For example, if an Activity is near the maximum number of attempts
N specified in its retry policy, `--reset-attempts` will allow the
Activity to be retried another N times after unpausing.

Use `--reset-heartbeat` to reset the Activity's heartbeats.

Activities can be specified by their Activity ID or Activity Type.
One of those parameters must be provided.

Specify the Activity ID or Type and Workflow IDs:

```
temporal activity unpause \
    --activity-id YourActivityId \
    --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
    --reset-attempts
    --reset-heartbeats
```

Activities can be unpaused in bulk via a visibility Query list filter.
For example, if you want to unpause activities of type Foo that you
previously paused, do:

```
temporal activity unpause \
    --query 'TemporalPauseInfo="property:activityType=Foo"'
```

Use the following options to change the behavior of this command.

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--activity-id`, `-a` | No | **string** The Activity ID to unpause.  Mutually exclusive with `--query`, `--match-all`, and `--activity-type`. Requires `--workflow-id` to be specified. |
| `--activity-type` | No | **string** Activities of this Type will unpause. Can only be used without --match-all. Either `activity-id` or `activity-type` must be provided, but not both. |
| `--jitter` | No | **duration** The activity will start at random a time within the specified duration. Can only be used with --query. |
| `--match-all` | No | **bool** Every paused activity should be unpaused. This flag is ignored if activity-type is provided. |
| `--query`, `-q` | No | **string** Content for an SQL-like `QUERY` List Filter. You must set either --workflow-id or --query. |
| `--reason` | No | **string** Reason for batch operation. Only use with --query. Defaults to user name. |
| `--reset-attempts` | No | **bool** Reset the activity attempts. |
| `--reset-heartbeats` | No | **bool** Reset the Activity's heartbeats. Only works with --reset-attempts. |
| `--rps` | No | **float** Limit batch's requests per second. Only allowed if query is present. |
| `--run-id`, `-r` | No | **string** Run ID. Only use with --workflow-id. Cannot use with --query. |
| `--workflow-id`, `-w` | No | **string** Workflow ID. You must set either --workflow-id or --query. |
| `--yes`, `-y` | No | **bool** Don't prompt to confirm signaling. Only allowed when --query is present. |

## update-options

Update the options of a running Activity that were passed into it from
a Workflow. Updates are incremental, only changing the specified options.

For example:

```
temporal activity update-options \
    --activity-id YourActivityId \
    --workflow-id YourWorkflowId \
    --task-queue NewTaskQueueName \
    --schedule-to-close-timeout DURATION \
    --schedule-to-start-timeout DURATION \
    --start-to-close-timeout DURATION \
    --heartbeat-timeout DURATION \
    --retry-initial-interval DURATION \
    --retry-maximum-interval DURATION \
    --retry-backoff-coefficient NewBackoffCoefficient \
    --retry-maximum-attempts NewMaximumAttempts
```

You may follow this command with `temporal activity reset`, and the new values will apply after the reset.

Either `activity-id`, `activity-type`, or `--match-all` must be specified.

Activity options can be updated in bulk with a visibility query list filter. 
For example, if you want to reset for activities of type Foo, do:

```
temporal activity update-options \
    --query 'TemporalPauseInfo="property:activityType=Foo"'
    ...
```

Use the following options to change the behavior of this command.

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--activity-id`, `-a` | No | **string** The Activity ID to update options. Mutually exclusive with `--query`, `--match-all`, and `--activity-type`. Requires `--workflow-id` to be specified. |
| `--activity-type` | No | **string** Activities of this Type will be updated. Mutually exclusive with `--match-all` and `activity-id`. |
| `--heartbeat-timeout` | No | **duration** Maximum permitted time between successful worker heartbeats. |

| `--retry-initial-interval` | No | **duration** Interval of the first retry. If retryBackoffCoefficient is 1.0 then it is used for all retries. |
| `--retry-maximum-attempts` | No | **int** Maximum number of attempts. When exceeded the retries stop even if not expired yet. Setting this value to 1 disables retries. Setting this value to 0 means unlimited attempts(up to the timeouts). |
| `--retry-maximum-interval` | No | **duration** Maximum interval between retries. Exponential backoff leads to interval increase. This value is the cap of the increase. |
| `--rps` | No | **float** Limit batch's requests per second. Only allowed if query is present. |
| `--run-id`, `-r` | No | **string** Run ID. Only use with --workflow-id. Cannot use with --query. |

| `--schedule-to-start-timeout` | No | **duration** Limits time an activity task can stay in a task queue before a worker picks it up. This timeout is always non retryable, as all a retry would achieve is to put it back into the same queue. Defaults to the schedule-to-close timeout or workflow execution timeout if not specified. |
| `--start-to-close-timeout` | No | **duration** Maximum time an activity is allowed to execute after being picked up by a worker. This timeout is always retryable. |
| `--task-queue` | No | **string** Name of the task queue for the Activity. |
