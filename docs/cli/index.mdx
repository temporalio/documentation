The Temporal CLI (`temporal`) provides direct access to a Temporal Service via the terminal. Use it to manage, monitor,
and debug Temporal applications, plus run an embedded development service when you need fast local feedback.

In addition, we provide and maintain an official extension for the Temporal CLI you can use to interact with Temporal
Cloud. Use the extension to manage your Temporal Cloud Namespaces, Workflows, and perform other operational and
administrative tasks.

## Install and configure the CLI

Set up the CLI, run a local development server, and configure your environment in
[Install and configure the CLI](/cli/setup-cli).

## Integrate CLI with Temporal Cloud

Connect the `temporal` CLI to Temporal Cloud with environment profiles and authentication settings in
[Integrate CLI with Temporal Cloud](/cli/temporal-cloud).

## Common CLI operations

Walk through everyday workflows such as starting, listing, and describing Workflows in
[Common CLI operations](/cli/common-operations).
