This page provides a reference for the `temporal` CLI `workflow` command. The flags applicable to each subcommand are presented in a table within the heading for the subcommand. Refer to [Global Flags](#global-flags) for flags that you can use with every subcommand.

## cancel

Canceling a running Workflow Execution records a
`WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in the Event History. The Service
schedules a new Command Task, and the Workflow Execution performs any cleanup
work supported by its implementation.

Use the Workflow ID to cancel an Execution:

```
temporal workflow cancel \
    --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
```

A visibility Query lets you send bulk cancellations to Workflow Executions
matching the results:

```
temporal workflow cancel \
    --query YourQuery
```

Visit https://docs.temporal.io/visibility to read more about Search Attributes
and Query creation. See `temporal batch --help` for a quick reference.

Use the following options to change the behavior of this command. You can also use any of the [global flags](#global-flags) that apply to all subcommands.

| Flag | Required | Description |

| `--headers` | No | **string[]** Temporal workflow headers in 'KEY=VALUE' format. Keys must be identifiers, and values must be JSON values. May be passed multiple times to set multiple Temporal headers. Note: These are workflow headers, not gRPC headers. |
| `--query`, `-q` | No | **string** Content for an SQL-like `QUERY` List Filter. You must set either --workflow-id or --query. |
| `--reason` | No | **string** Reason for batch operation. Only use with --query. Defaults to user name. |
| `--rps` | No | **float** Limit batch's requests per second. Only allowed if query is present. |

## count

Show a count of Workflow Executions, regardless of execution state (running,

## delete

## terminate

Terminate a Workflow Execution:

```
temporal workflow terminate \

    --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
```

The reason is optional and defaults to the current user's name. The reason
is stored in the Event History as part of the `WorkflowExecutionTerminated`
event. This becomes the closing Event in the Workflow Execution's history.

Executions may be terminated in bulk via a visibility Query list filter:

```
temporal workflow terminate \
    --query YourQuery \
    --reason YourReasonForTermination
```

Workflow code cannot see or respond to terminations. To perform clean-up work
in your Workflow code, use `temporal workflow cancel` instead.

next Workflow Task change behavior to `auto_upgrade`:

```
temporal workflow update-options \
    --workflow-id YourWorkflowId \
    --versioning-override-behavior auto_upgrade
```

or to pin the workflow execution to a Worker Deployment, set behavior
to `pinned`:

    --versioning-override-behavior pinned \
    --versioning-override-deployment-name YourDeploymentName \
    --versioning-override-build-id YourDeploymentBuildId

To remove any previous overrides, set the behavior to
`unspecified`:

```
