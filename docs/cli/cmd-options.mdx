## input-file

Passes optional input for the Workflow from a JSON file.
If there are multiple JSON files, concatenate them and separate by space or newline.

Each goroutine processes one line for every second.

## input-separator

This command option accepts a valid JSON string.
If the entity that the command is acting on accepts multiple parameters, pass "null" for null values within the JSON string.

The following is an example of starting a Workflow with the `--input` command option.
This Workflow expects a single string as a parameter:

```shell
temporal workflow start --input '"+1 555-555-5555"'
```

## interval

Interval duration, such as 90m, or 90m/13m to include phase offset.
