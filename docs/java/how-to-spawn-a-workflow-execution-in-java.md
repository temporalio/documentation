Use `WorkflowStub` to start a Workflow Execution from within a Client, and `ExternalWorkflowStub` to start a different Workflow Execution from within a Workflow.

See [`SignalwithStart`](/docs/java/signals) to start a Workflow Execution to receive a Signal from within another Workflow.

### Using `WorkflowStub`

`WorkflowStub` are proxies generated by the `WorkflowClient`.
You can use typed or untyped `WorkflowStub` in the client code.
See [Workflow Client Initialization](/docs/java/how-to-initialize-a-workflow-client-in-java) for details on how to initialize a Workflow Client.

A Workflow Execution can be started either synchronously or asynchronously.

- Synchronous invocation starts a Workflow and then waits for its completion. If the process that started the Workflow crashes or stops waiting, the Workflow continues executing.
  Because Workflows are potentially long-running, and Client crashes happen, it is not very commonly found in production use.
  The following example is a type-safe approach for starting a Workflow Execution synchronously.

  ```java
    NotifyUserAccounts workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(
          NotifyUserAccounts.class,
          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                  .setWorkflowId("notifyAccounts")
                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                  .build()
          );

  // start the Workflow and wait for a result.
    workflow.notify(new String[] { "Account1", "Account2", "Account3", "Account4", "Account5",
                  "Account6", "Account7", "Account8", "Account9", "Account10"});
      }
  // notify(String[] accountIds) is a Workflow method defined in the Workflow Definition.
  ```

- Asynchronous start initiates a Workflow Execution and immediately returns to the caller. This is the most common way to start Workflows in production code.
  The `WorkflowClient`<https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClient.java)> provides some static methods, such as `start`, `execute`, `signalWithStart` etc., that help with starting your Workflows asynchronously.

  The following examples show how to start Workflow Executions asynchronously, with either typed or untyped `WorkflowStub`.

  - **Typed WorkflowStub Example**

    ```java
    // create typed Workflow stub
    FileProcessingWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(FileProcessingWorkflow.class,
          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                  .build());
    // use WorkflowClient.execute (if your Workflow takes in arguments) or WorkflowClient.start (for zero arguments)
    WorkflowClient.start(workflow::greetCustomer);
    ```

  - **Untyped WorkflowStub Example**

    ```java
    WorkflowStub untyped = client.newUntypedWorkflowStub("FileProcessingWorkflow",
          WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                  .setWorkflowId(workflowId)
                  .setTaskQueue(taskQueue)
                  .build());

    // blocks until Workflow Execution has been started (not until it completes)
    untyped.start(argument);
    ```

See [Workflow Execution Result](/docs/java/how-to-get-the-result-of-a-workflow-execution-in-java) for details on how to get the results of the Workflow Execution.

### Using `ExternalWorkflowStub`

Use `ExternalWorkflowStub` within a Workflow to invoke, and send Signals to, other Workflows by type.

This helps particularly for executing Workflows written in other language SDKs, as shown in the following example.

```java
@Override
    public String exec() {

        ExternalWorkflowStub externalGoWorkflowStub = Workflow.newUntypedExternalWorkflowStub("simple-workflow-go");

        // Send 10 signals to Go Workflow
        for(int i=0; i < 10; i++) {
            externalGoWorkflowStub.signal("simplesignal", "Hello from Java Workflow: " + i);
        }

        // Receive 10 signals from Go Workflow
        Workflow.await(() -> messageQueue.size() == 10);

        String result = "";
        for(String m : messageQueue) {
            result += m + "\n";
        }
```

See [Temporal Polyglot example](https://github.com/tsurdilo/temporal-polyglot) sample for how to execute Workflows written in other language SDKs.

### Recurring start

You can start a Workflow Execution on a regular schedule with [the CronSchedule option](/docs/java/distributed-cron).
