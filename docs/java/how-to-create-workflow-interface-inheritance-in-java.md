Workflow interfaces can form inheritance hierarchies, which can be useful for creating components that can be reused across multiple Workflow interfaces.
For example, to implement a UI or CLI button that sends a `retryNow` Signal to any Workflow, define the method as follows:

```java
public interface Retryable {
    @SignalMethod
    void retryNow();
}

@WorkflowInterface
public interface FileProcessingWorkflow extends Retryable {

    @WorkflowMethod
    String processFile(Arguments args);

    @QueryMethod
    String getStatus();

    @SignalMethod
    void abandon();
}
```

By using this approach, another Workflow interface can extend just `Retryable`:

```java
@WorkflowInterface
public interface MediaProcessingWorkflow extends Retryable {

    @WorkflowMethod
    String processBlob(Arguments args);
}
```

Note that this approach does not apply to `@WorkflowMethod` annotations. This means that, when using a base interface, it should not include any `@WorkflowMethod` methods.
To illustrate this, let's say that we define the following _invalid_ code:

```java
// INVALID CODE!
public interface BaseWorkflow {
    @WorkflowMethod
    void retryNow();
}

@WorkflowInterface
public interface Workflow1 extends BaseWorkflow {}

@WorkflowInterface
public interface Workflow2 extends BaseWorkflow {}
```

Attempting to register implementations of _Workflow1_ and _Workflow2_ with a Worker will fail.
For example, if we tried to register the _Workflow1_ and _Workflow2_ as shown:

```java
worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(
        Workflow1Impl.class, Workflow2Impl.class);
```

This registration fails with the following message:

```text
java.lang.IllegalStateException: BaseWorkflow workflow type is already registered with the worker
```
