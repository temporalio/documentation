A Workflow Task Timeout is the maximum amount of time allowed for a [Worker](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-worker) to execute a [Workflow Task](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-task) after the Worker has pulled that Workflow Task from the [Task Queue](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-task-queue).

**The default value is 10 seconds.**
This timeout is primarily available to recognize whether a Worker has gone down so that the Workflow Execution can be recovered on a different Worker.
The main reason for increasing the default value would be to accommodate a Workflow Execution that has a very long Workflow Execution History that could take longer than 10 seconds for the Worker to load.
