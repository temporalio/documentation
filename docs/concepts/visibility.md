This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Temporal Visibility.

The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.

## Standard Visibility

Standard Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that list Workflow Executions by a predefined set of filters.

Open Workflow Executions can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, or Run Id.

Closed Workflow Executions can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, Run Id, or Execution Status (Completed, Failed, Timed Out, Terminated, Canceled, or Continued-As-New).

## Advanced Visibility

Advanced Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that enable the listing, filtering, and sorting of Workflow Executions through a custom SQL-like <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- With Temporal Cluster version 1.20 and later, Advanced Visibility is available on SQL databases like MySQL (version 8.0.17 and later) and PostgreSQL (version 12 and later), in addition to supporting Elasticsearch.
- For Temporal Server versions 1.19.1 and earlier, you must <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">integrate with ElasticSearch<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to integrate Elasticsearch into a Temporal Cluster</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To integrate Elasticsearch with your Temporal Cluster, edit the `persistence` section of your `development.yaml` configuration file and run the index schema setup commands.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to use Advanced Visibility.
  Elasticsearch takes on the Visibility request load, relieving potential performance issues.
  We highly recommend operating a Temporal Cluster with Elasticsearch for any use case that spawns more than just a few Workflow Executions.

## List Filter

A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to a <a class="tdlp" href="#">Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Visibility?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> List API.

A List Filter contains <a class="tdlp" href="#search-attribute">Search Attribute<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#search-attribute">Learn more</a></span></span></a> names, Search Attribute values, and [operators](#supported-operators) to pull a filtered list of Workflow Executions from the Visibility store.

### Supported operators

A List Filter contains <a class="tdlp" href="#search-attribute">Search Attribute<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#search-attribute">Learn more</a></span></span></a> names, Search Attribute values, and the following supported operators:

- **=, !=, >, >=, <, <=**
- **AND, OR, ()**
- **BETWEEN ... AND**
- **IN**
- **ORDER BY**

The **ORDER BY** operator is supported only when Elasticsearch is used as the Visibility store.

The **ORDER BY** operator is currently not supported in Temporal Cloud.

Custom Search Attributes of the `Text` type cannot be used in **ORDER BY** clauses.

### Partial string match

The `=` operator works like **CONTAINS** to find Workflows with Search Attributes that contain a specific word.

<!-- note: advanced vis features will be supported in SQL upon the release of v1.20.-->

For example, if you have a custom Search Attribute named `Description` of `Text` type with the value of "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", searching for `Description='quick'` or `Description='fox'` will successfully return the Workflow.
However, partial word searches such as `Description='qui'` or `Description='laz'` will not return the Workflow.
This is because [Elasticsearch's tokenizer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-standard-tokenizer.html) is configured to return complete words as tokens.

### Efficient API usage

An Advanced List Filter API may take longer to respond if it is retrieving a large number of Workflow Executions (over 10,000).

With Temporal Server v1.20 and later, you can use the `CountWorkflow` API to efficiently count the number of <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Workflow Executions<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution. It is the main unit of execution of a Temporal Application.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Paginate the results with the `ListWorkflow` API by using the page token to retrieve the next page; continue until the page token is `null`/`nil`.

#### List Filter examples

The following is a List Filter set with <a class="tdlp" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">`tctl`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">tctl workflow list</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">How to list open or closed Workflow Executions using tctl.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">Learn more</a></span></span></a>:

```
WorkflowType = "main.YourWorkflowDefinition" and ExecutionStatus != "Running" and (StartTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or CloseTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34-08:00")
```

When used, a list of Workflows that meet the following conditions are returned:

- The Workflow Type is set to `main.YourWorkflowDefinition`.
- The Workflow isn't running.
- The Workflow either started after "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or closed after "2021-06-07T16:46:34-08:00".

More List Filter examples have been provided below.

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' or WorkflowId = '<another-workflow-id>'
```

```sql
WorkflowId IN ('<workflow-id>', '<another-workflow-id>')
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' order by StartTime desc
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' and ExecutionStatus = 'Running'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' or ExecutionStatus = 'Running'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' and StartTime > '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
ExecutionTime between '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00' and '2021-08-28T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
ExecutionTime < '2021-08-28T15:04:05+00:00' or ExecutionTime > '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
order by ExecutionTime
```

```sql
order by StartTime desc, CloseTime asc
```

```sql
order by CustomIntField asc
```

## Search Attribute

A Search Attribute is an indexed field used in a <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to filter a list of [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution) that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.

Each Search Attribute is a key-value pair metadata object and is part of the Workflow Execution visibility information, stored in the Visibility store. Use Search Attributes for metadata and search purposes only, not business logic.

Temporal provides some [default Search Attributes](#default-search-attributes), such as `ExecutionStatus` of your Workflow Execution.
You can also create [custom Search Attribute](#custom-search-attributes) keys in your Visibility store and assign values in a Workflow Execution.

Search Attribute values are assigned to a specific Workflow Execution and are available for that execution only for the duration of the specified Namespace <a class="tdlp" href="/clusters#retention-period">Retention Period<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retention Period?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retention Period is the amount of time a Workflow Execution Event History remains in the Cluster's persistence store.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/clusters#retention-period">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Note that Search Attribute values are not encrypted because the Temporal Server must be able to read these values from the Visibility store when retrieving Workflow Execution details.

When using <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Continue-As-New<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Continue-As-New?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Continue-As-New is the mechanism by which all relevant state is passed to a new Workflow Execution with a fresh Event History.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Temporal Cron Job<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cron Job?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, Search Attributes are carried over to the new Workflow Run by default.

### Default Search Attributes

A Temporal Cluster has a set of default Search Attributes already available.
Default Search Attributes are set globally in any Namespace.
These Search Attributes are created when the initial index is created.

- All default Search Attributes are reserved and read-only.
  You cannot create a custom one with the same name or alter the existing one.

- ExecutionStatus values correspond to Workflow Execution statuses: Running, Completed, Failed, Canceled, Terminated, ContinuedAsNew, TimedOut.

- StartTime, CloseTime, and ExecutionTime are stored as dates but are supported by queries that use either EpochTime in nanoseconds or a string in [RFC3339Nano format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants) (such as "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00").

- ExecutionDuration is stored in nanoseconds but is supported by queries that use integers in nanoseconds, [Golang duration format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration), or "hh:mm:ss" format.

- CloseTime, HistoryLength, StateTransitionCount, and ExecutionDuration are present only in a closed Workflow Execution.

- ExecutionTime can differ from StartTime in retry and cron use cases.

You can use the default Search Attributes in a List Filter, such as in the Temporal Web UI or with the `tctl workflow list` commands, under the following conditions:

- Without Advanced Visibility, you can only use the `=` operator with a single default Search Attribute in your List Filter.
  For example: `tctl workflow list -q "ExecutionStatus = 'Completed'"` or `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = 'YourWorkflow'"`.
- With Advanced Visibility, you can combine default Search Attributes in a List Filter to get a list of specific Workflow Executions.
  For example: `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = 'main.YourWorkflowDefinition' and ExecutionStatus != 'Running' and (StartTime > '2022-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00' or CloseTime < '2022-06-08T16:46:34-08:00')"`

### Custom Search Attributes

You can <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#create-custom-search-attributes">create custom Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create custom Search Attributes</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Add custom Search Attributes to your Visibility store using `tctl` for self-hosted Temporal Cluster, and `tcld` for Temporal Cloud.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#create-custom-search-attributes">Learn more</a></span></span></a> with unique key names that are relevant to your business needs.

Use custom Search Attributes in a List Filter, such as in the Temporal Web UI or with the `tctl workflow list` commands, under the following conditions:

- Without Advanced Visibility, you cannot use a custom Search Attribute in your List Filter.
- With Advanced Visibility, you can create multiple custom Search Attributes and use them in combinations with List Filters to get a list of specific Workflow Executions.
  For example: `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = 'main.YourWorkflowDefinition' and YourCustomSA = 'YourCustomSAValue' and (StartTime > '2022-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00' or CloseTime < '2022-06-08T16:46:34-08:00')"`
  - With Temporal Server v1.19 and earlier, you must <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">integrate Elasticsearch<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to integrate Elasticsearch into a Temporal Cluster</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To integrate Elasticsearch with your Temporal Cluster, edit the `persistence` section of your `development.yaml` configuration file and run the index schema setup commands.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to use custom Search Attributes with List Filters.
  - With Temporal Server v1.20 and later, custom Search Attribute capabilities are available on MySQL (v8.0.17 or later), PostgreSQL (v12 and later), and SQLite (v3.31.0 and later), in addition to Elasticsearch.

If you use Elasticsearch as your Visibility store, your custom Search Attributes apply globally and can be used across Namespaces.
However, if using any of the [supported SQL databases](/cluster-deployment-guide#visibility-store) with Temporal Server v1.20 and later, your custom Search Attributes are associated with a specific Namespace and can be used for Workflow Executions in that Namespace.

See [Search Attribute limits](#search-attributes-limits) for limits on the number and size of custom Search Attributes you can create.

#### Supported types

Custom Search Attributes must be one of the following types:

- Bool
- Datetime
- Double
- Int
- Keyword
- KeywordList
- Text

Note:

- **Double** is backed up by `scaled_float` Elasticsearch type with scale factor 10000 (4 decimal digits).
- **Datetime** is backed up by `date` type with milliseconds precision in Elasticsearch 6 and `date_nanos` type with nanoseconds precision in Elasticsearch 7.
- **Int** is 64-bit integer (`long` Elasticsearch type).
- **Keyword** and **Text** types are concepts taken from Elasticsearch. Each word in a **Text** is considered a searchable keyword.
  For a UUID, that can be problematic because Elasticsearch indexes each portion of the UUID separately.
  To have the whole string considered as a searchable keyword, use the **Keyword** type.
  For example, if the key `ProductId` has the value of `2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`:
  - As a **Keyword** it would be matched only by `ProductId = "2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`.
  - As a **Text** it would be matched by `ProductId = 2dd8`, which could cause unwanted matches.
- With Temporal Server v1.19 and earlier, the **Keyword** type can store a list of values.
- With Temporal Server v1.20 and later, the **Keyword** type supports only a single value.
  To store a list of values, use **KeywordList**.
- The **Text** type cannot be used in the "Order By" clause.

#### Custom Search Attributes limits

<!-- TODO - [How to configure maximum number of Search Attribute keys per Cluster](#) -->

The following table lists the maximum number of custom Search Attributes you can create per Namespace by supported Visibility database.

| Search Attribute type | MySQL (v8.0.17 and later) | PostgreSQL (v12 and later) | SQLite (v3.31.0 and later) | Temporal Cloud |

Temporal does not impose a limit on the number of custom Search Attributes you can create with Elasticsearch. However, [Elasticsearch sets a default mapping limit](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/mapping-settings-limit.html) that may apply.
Custom Search Attributes are an Advanced Visibility feature and are not supported on Cassandra.

Size limits for a custom Search Attribute:

<!--
_This refers to the SA key you create in the visibility store with `tctl search-attribute create`. this value is no longer applicable so commenting out for ref later_
Default total maximum number of Search Attribute **keys** per Temporal Cluster is 100.-->

- The default single Search Attribute **value** size limit is 2 KB.

<!-- TODO - [How to configure Search Attribute value size limit](#) -->

- The maximum total Search Attribute size is 40 KB.

<!-- TODO - [How to configure total Search Attribute size limite](#) -->

<!-- temp keeping for reference
This is configurable with [`SearchAttributesNumberOfKeysLimit`, `SearchAttributesTotalSizeLimit` and `SearchAttributesSizeOfValueLimit`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L440-L442), if you know what you are doing.

### Usage

Search Attributes available in your Visibility store can be used with Workflow Executions for that Cluster.
To actually have results from the use of a <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an Advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, Search Attributes must be added to a Workflow Execution as metadata.

- To create custom Search Attributes in your Visibility store, see <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#create-custom-search-attributes">Create custom Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create custom Search Attributes</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Add custom Search Attributes to your Visibility store using `tctl` for self-hosted Temporal Cluster, and `tcld` for Temporal Cloud.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#create-custom-search-attributes">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
- To remove a custom Search Attribute from the Visbility store, see <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#remove-custom-search-attributes">Remove custom Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to remove custom Search Attributes</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Remove custom Search Attributes from your self-hosted Temporal Cluster Visibility store using `tctl`.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#remove-custom-search-attributes">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
  Removing custom Search Attributes is not supported on Temporal Cloud.
- To rename a custom Search Attribute on Temporal Cloud, see [`tcld namespace search-attributes rename`](/cloud/tcld/namespace#rename).

With Workflows you can do the following:

- Set the value of Search Attributes in your Workflow
- Update the value set for a Search Attribute from within the Workflow code
- Remove the value set for a Search Attribute from within the Workflow code

- To get a list of Search Attributes using `tctl`, see [How to view Search Attributes using tctl](/tctl-v1/cluster#get-search-attributes).

After you add and set your Search Attributes, use your default or custom Search Attributes in a List Filter.

<!-- commenting out this part. added this detail in how to create a custom search attribute under clusters.
The [temporalio/auto-setup](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/auto-setup) Docker image uses a pre-defined set of custom Search Attributes that are handy for testing.
Their names indicate their types:

- CustomBoolField
- CustomDatetimeField
- CustomDoubleField
- CustomIntField
- CustomKeywordField
- CustomTextField
