This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Temporal Visibility.

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

- For Temporal Server v1.19 and earlier, all supported databases for Visibility provide standard Visibility features, and an Elasticsearch database is required for advanced Visibility features.
- For Temporal Server v1.20 and later, advanced Visibility features are enabled on all supported SQL databases, in addition to Elasticsearch.
- In Temporal Server v1.21 and later, standard Visibility is no longer in development, and we recommend migrating to a [database that supports advanced Visibility features](/cluster-deployment-guide#supported-databases). Visibility configuration in Temporal Cluster is updated and Dual Visibility is enabled. For details, see [Visibility store setup](/cluster-deployment-guide#visibility-store).

:::

The term [Visibility](/visibility), within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view, filter, and search for Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.

The [Visibility store](/cluster-deployment-guide#visibility-store) in your Temporal Cluster stores persisted Workflow Execution Event History data and is set up as a part of your <a class="tdlp" href="/clusters#persistence">Persistence store<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cluster?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cluster is a Temporal Server paired with Persistence and Visibility stores.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/clusters#persistence">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to enable listing and filtering details about Workflow Executions that exist on your Temporal Cluster.

- [How to set up a Visibility store](/cluster-deployment-guide#visibility-store)

With Temporal Server v1.21, you can set up <a class="tdlp" href="#dual-visibility">Dual Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Dual Visibility?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Dual Visibility is a feature that lets you set a secondary Visibility store in your Temporal Cluster to facilitate migrating your Visibility data from one database to another.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#dual-visibility">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to migrate your Visibility store from one database to another.

<!-- A Visibility store can be configured to provide [atandard Visibility](/visibility#standard-visibility) and [advanced Visibility](/visibility#advanced-visibility) features.

Support for separate standard and advanced Visibility setups will be deprecated from Temporal Server v1.21 onwards. Check [Supported databases](/cluster-deployment-guide#supported-databases) for updates. -->

## What is standard Visibility? {#Standard Visibility}

Standard Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that list Workflow Executions by a predefined set of filters.

Open Workflow Executions can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, or Run Id.

Closed Workflow Executions can be filtered by a time constraint and either a Workflow Type, Workflow Id, Run Id, or Execution Status (Completed, Failed, Timed Out, Terminated, Canceled, or Continued-As-New).

Support for standard Visibility is deprecated beginning with Temporal Server v1.21.
For updates, check [Supported databases](/cluster-deployment-guide#supported-databases).

## What is advanced Visibility? {#Advanced Visibility}

Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that enable the listing, filtering, and sorting of <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Workflow Executions<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution. It is the main unit of execution of a Temporal Application.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a> through a custom SQL-like <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- In Temporal Cluster version 1.20 and later, advanced Visibility is available on SQL databases like MySQL (version 8.0.17 and later) and PostgreSQL (version 12 and later), in addition to support for Elasticsearch.
- For Temporal Server versions 1.19.1 and earlier, you must <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">integrate with ElasticSearch<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to integrate Elasticsearch into a Temporal Cluster</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To integrate Elasticsearch with your Temporal Cluster, edit the `persistence` section of your `development.yaml` configuration file and run the index schema setup commands.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to use advanced Visibility.
  Elasticsearch takes on the Visibility request load, relieving potential performance issues.
  We highly recommend operating a Temporal Cluster with Elasticsearch for any use case that spawns more than just a few Workflow Executions.
- On Temporal Cloud, [advanced Visibility is enabled by default for all users](/cloud/how-to-get-started-with-temporal-cloud#invite-users).

## What is Dual Visibility? {#Dual Visibility}

Dual Visibility is a feature that lets you set a secondary Visibility store in addition to a primary store in your Temporal Cluster.
Setting up Dual Visibility is optional and can be used to [migrate your Visibility database](/cluster-deployment-guide#migrating-visibility-database) or create a backup Visibility store.

For example, if you have Cassandra configured as your Visibility database, you can set up a supported SQL database as your secondary Visibility store and gradually migrate your data to the secondary store before deprecating your primary one.

A Dual Visibility setup requires two Visibility store configurations:

- **Primary Visibility**: The primary Visibility store where Visibility data is written to and read from by default. The primary Visibility store is set with the `visibilityStore` configuration key in your Temporal Cluster.
- **Secondary Visibility**: A secondary storage for your Visibility data. The secondary Visibility store is set with the `secondaryVisibilityStore` configuration key in your Temporal Cluster.

For configuration details, see [Dual Visibility setup](/cluster-deployment-guide#dual-visibility).

The following combinations are allowed in a Dual Visibility setting.

| Primary                     | Secondary                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Standard (Cassandra or SQL) | Advanced (SQL or Elasticsearch) |
| Advanced (SQL)              | Advanced (SQL)                  |
| Advanced (Elasticsearch)    | Advanced (Elasticsearch)        |

With Dual Visibility, you can read from only one Visibility store at a time, but can configure your Temporal Cluster to write to primary only, secondary only, or to both primary and secondary Visibility stores.
When migrating from one Visibility store database to another, set up the database you want to migrate to as your secondary Visibility store.

You can plan your migration using specific dynamic configuration keys that help you transition your read and write operations from the primary to the secondary Visibility store.
For details on migrating your Visibility store databases, see <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#dual-visibility">Dual Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to set up Dual Visibility</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To enable Dual Visibility, set up a secondary Visibility store with your primary Visibility, and configure your Temporal Cluster to enable read and/or write operations on the secondary Visibility store.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#dual-visibility">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

## What is a List Filter? {#List Filter}

A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to a <a class="tdlp" href="/clusters#visibility">Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Visibility?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/clusters#visibility">Learn more</a></span></span></a> List API.

A List Filter contains <a class="tdlp" href="#search-attribute">Search Attribute<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#search-attribute">Learn more</a></span></span></a> names, Search Attribute values, and [operators](#supported-operators) to pull a filtered list of Workflow Executions from the Visibility store.

### Supported operators

A List Filter contains <a class="tdlp" href="#search-attribute">Search Attribute<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Search Attribute?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Search Attribute is an indexed name used in List Filters to filter a list of Workflow Executions that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#search-attribute">Learn more</a></span></span></a> names, Search Attribute values, and the following supported operators:

- **=, !=, >, >=, <, <=**
- **AND, OR, ()**
- **BETWEEN ... AND**
- **IN**

<!-- - **ORDER BY** -->

<!-- The **ORDER BY** operator is supported only when Elasticsearch is used as the Visibility store.

The **ORDER BY** operator is currently not supported in Temporal Cloud.

Custom Search Attributes of the `Text` type cannot be used in **ORDER BY** clauses. -->

### Partial string match

The `=` operator works like **CONTAINS** to find Workflows with Search Attributes that contain a specific word.

<!-- note: advanced vis features will be supported in SQL upon the release of v1.20.-->

For example, if you have a custom Search Attribute named `Description` of `Text` type with the value of "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", searching for `Description='quick'` or `Description='fox'` will successfully return the Workflow.
However, partial word searches such as `Description='qui'` or `Description='laz'` will not return the Workflow.
This is because [Elasticsearch's tokenizer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-standard-tokenizer.html) is configured to return complete words as tokens.

### Efficient API usage

An Advanced List Filter API may take longer to respond if it is retrieving a large number of Workflow Executions (over 10,000).

With Temporal Server v1.20 and later, you can use the `CountWorkflow` API to efficiently count the number of <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Workflow Executions<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution. It is the main unit of execution of a Temporal Application.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Paginate the results with the `ListWorkflow` API by using the page token to retrieve the next page; continue until the page token is `null`/`nil`.

#### List Filter examples

The following is a List Filter set with <a class="tdlp" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list"> `tctl`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">tctl workflow list</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">How to list open or closed Workflow Executions using tctl.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tctl-v1/workflow#list">Learn more</a></span></span></a>:

```
WorkflowType = "main.YourWorkflowDefinition" and ExecutionStatus != "Running" and (StartTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or CloseTime > "2021-06-07T16:46:34-08:00")
```

When used, a list of Workflows that meet the following conditions are returned:

- The Workflow Type is set to `main.YourWorkflowDefinition`.
- The Workflow isn't running.
- The Workflow either started after "2021-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00" or closed after "2021-06-07T16:46:34-08:00".

More List Filter examples have been provided below.

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' or WorkflowId = '<another-workflow-id>'
```

```sql
WorkflowId IN ('<workflow-id>', '<another-workflow-id>')
```

<!-- ```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' order by StartTime desc
``` -->

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' and ExecutionStatus = 'Running'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' or ExecutionStatus = 'Running'
```

```sql
WorkflowId = '<workflow-id>' and StartTime > '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
ExecutionTime between '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00' and '2021-08-28T15:04:05+00:00'
```

```sql
ExecutionTime < '2021-08-28T15:04:05+00:00' or ExecutionTime > '2021-08-22T15:04:05+00:00'
```

<!-- ```sql
order by ExecutionTime
```

```sql
order by StartTime desc, CloseTime asc
```

```sql
order by CustomIntField asc
``` -->

## What is a Search Attribute? {#Search Attribute}

A Search Attribute is an indexed field used in a <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to filter a list of [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution) that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.

Each Search Attribute is a key-value pair metadata object included in a Workflow Execution's Visibility information.
This information is available in the Visibility store.

:::note

Search Attribute values are not encrypted because the Temporal Server must be able to read these values from the Visibility store when retrieving Workflow Execution details.

:::

Temporal provides some [default Search Attributes](#default-search-attributes), such as `ExecutionStatus`, the current state of your Workflow Executions.
You can also create [custom Search Attribute](#custom-search-attributes) keys in your Visibility store and assign values when starting a Workflow Execution or in Workflow code.

When using <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Continue-As-New<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Continue-As-New?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Continue-As-New is the mechanism by which all relevant state is passed to a new Workflow Execution with a fresh Event History.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#continue-as-new">Learn more</a></span></span></a> or a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Temporal Cron Job<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cron Job?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cron Job is the series of Workflow Executions that occur when a Cron Schedule is provided in the call to spawn a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#temporal-cron-job">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, Search Attribute keys are carried over to the new Workflow Run by default.
Search Attribute values are only available for as long as the Workflow is.

Search Attributes are most effective for search purposes or tasks requiring collection-based result sets.
For business logic in which you need to get information about a Workflow Execution, consider one of the following:

- Storing state in a local variable and exposing it with a Query.
- Storing state in an external datastore through Activities and fetching it directly from the store.

If your business logic requires high throughput or low latency, store and fetch the data through Activities.
You might experience lag due to time passing between the Workflow's state change and the Activity updating the Visibility store.

### Default Search Attributes

A Temporal Cluster has a set of default Search Attributes already available.
Default Search Attributes are set globally in any Namespace.
These Search Attributes are created when the initial index is created.

| NAME                       | TYPE         | DEFINITION                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

- All default Search Attributes are reserved and read-only.
  You cannot create a custom one with the same name or alter the existing one.

- ExecutionStatus values correspond to Workflow Execution statuses: Running, Completed, Failed, Canceled, Terminated, ContinuedAsNew, TimedOut.

- StartTime, CloseTime, and ExecutionTime are stored as dates but are supported by queries that use either EpochTime in nanoseconds or a string in [RFC3339Nano format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants) (such as "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00").

- ExecutionDuration is stored in nanoseconds but is supported by queries that use integers in nanoseconds, [Golang duration format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration), or "hh:mm:ss" format.

- CloseTime, HistoryLength, StateTransitionCount, and ExecutionDuration are present only in a closed Workflow Execution.

- ExecutionTime can differ from StartTime in retry and cron use cases.

You can use the default Search Attributes in a List Filter, such as in the Temporal Web UI or with the `tctl workflow list` commands, under the following conditions:

- Without advanced Visibility, you can only use the `=` operator with a single default Search Attribute in your List Filter.
  For example: `tctl workflow list -q "ExecutionStatus = 'Completed'"` or `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = 'YourWorkflow'"`.
- With advanced Visibility, you can combine default Search Attributes in a List Filter to get a list of specific Workflow Executions.
  For example: `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = 'main.YourWorkflowDefinition' and ExecutionStatus != 'Running' and (StartTime > '2022-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00' or CloseTime < '2022-06-08T16:46:34-08:00')"`

### Custom Search Attributes

You can <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#create-custom-search-attributes">create custom Search Attributes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create custom Search Attributes</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Add custom Search Attributes to your Visibility store using `tctl` for self-hosted Temporal Cluster, and `tcld` for Temporal Cloud.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#create-custom-search-attributes">Learn more</a></span></span></a> with unique key names that are relevant to your business needs.

Use custom Search Attributes in a List Filter, such as in the Temporal Web UI or with the `tctl workflow list` commands, under the following conditions:

- Without advanced Visibility, you cannot use a custom Search Attribute in your List Filter.
- With advanced Visibility, you can create multiple custom Search Attributes and use them in combinations with List Filters to get a list of specific Workflow Executions.
  For example: `tctl workflow list -q "WorkflowType = 'main.YourWorkflowDefinition' and YourCustomSA = 'YourCustomSAValue' and (StartTime > '2022-06-07T16:46:34.236-08:00' or CloseTime < '2022-06-08T16:46:34-08:00')"`
  - With Temporal Server v1.19 and earlier, you must <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">integrate Elasticsearch<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to integrate Elasticsearch into a Temporal Cluster</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To integrate Elasticsearch with your Temporal Cluster, edit the `persistence` section of your `development.yaml` configuration file and run the index schema setup commands.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">Learn more</a></span></span></a> to use custom Search Attributes with List Filters.
  - With Temporal Server v1.20 and later, custom Search Attribute capabilities are available on MySQL (v8.0.17 or later), PostgreSQL (v12 and later), and SQLite (v3.31.0 and later), in addition to Elasticsearch.

If you use Elasticsearch as your Visibility store, your custom Search Attributes apply globally and can be used across Namespaces.
However, if using any of the [supported SQL databases](/cluster-deployment-guide#visibility-store) with Temporal Server v1.20 and later, your custom Search Attributes are associated with a specific Namespace and can be used for Workflow Executions in that Namespace.

See [custom Search Attributes limits](#custom-search-attributes-limits) for limits on the number and size of custom Search Attributes you can create.

#### Supported types

Custom Search Attributes must be one of the following types:

- Bool
- Datetime
- Double
- Int
- Keyword
- KeywordList
- Text

Note:

- **Double** is backed up by `scaled_float` Elasticsearch type with scale factor 10000 (4 decimal digits).
- **Datetime** is backed up by `date` type with milliseconds precision in Elasticsearch 6 and `date_nanos` type with nanoseconds precision in Elasticsearch 7.
- **Int** is 64-bit integer (`long` Elasticsearch type).
- **Keyword** and **Text** types are concepts taken from Elasticsearch. Each word in a **Text** is considered a searchable keyword.
  For a UUID, that can be problematic because Elasticsearch indexes each portion of the UUID separately.
  To have the whole string considered as a searchable keyword, use the **Keyword** type.
  For example, if the key `ProductId` has the value of `2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`:
  - As a **Keyword** it would be matched only by `ProductId = "2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1`.
  - As a **Text** it would be matched by `ProductId = 2dd8`, which could cause unwanted matches.
- With Temporal Server v1.19 and earlier, the **Keyword** type can store a list of values.
- With Temporal Server v1.20 and later, the **Keyword** type supports only a single value.
  To store a list of values, use **KeywordList**.
- The **Text** type cannot be used in the "Order By" clause.

#### Custom Search Attributes limits

<!-- TODO - [How to configure maximum number of Search Attribute keys per Cluster](#) -->

The following table lists the maximum number of custom Search Attributes you can create per Namespace by supported Visibility database.

| Search Attribute type | MySQL (v8.0.17 and later) | PostgreSQL (v12 and later) | SQLite (v3.31.0 and later) | Temporal Cloud |
| --------------------- | :-----------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------: |

| Double                |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |
| Int                   |             3             |             3              |             3              |       20       |
| Keyword               |            10             |             10             |             10             |       20       |

| Text                  |             3             |             3              |             3              |       5        |

Temporal does not impose a limit on the number of custom Search Attributes you can create with Elasticsearch. However, [Elasticsearch sets a default mapping limit](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/mapping-settings-limit.html) that may apply.
Custom Search Attributes are an advanced Visibility feature and are not supported on Cassandra.

Size limits for a custom Search Attribute:

<!--
_This refers to the SA key you create in the visibility store with `tctl search-attribute create`. this value is no longer applicable so commenting out for ref later_
Default total maximum number of Search Attribute **keys** per Temporal Cluster is 100.-->

- The default single Search Attribute **value** size limit is 2 KB.

<!-- TODO - [How to configure Search Attribute value size limit](#) -->

- The maximum total Search Attribute size is 40 KB.

<!-- TODO - [How to configure total Search Attribute size limite](#) -->

- The maximum total characters per Search Attribute value is 255.

<!-- temp keeping for reference
This is configurable with [`SearchAttributesNumberOfKeysLimit`, `SearchAttributesTotalSizeLimit` and `SearchAttributesSizeOfValueLimit`](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.7.0/service/history/configs/config.go#L440-L442), if you know what you are doing.

### Usage

Search Attributes available in your Visibility store can be used with Workflow Executions for that Cluster.
To actually have results from the use of a <a class="tdlp" href="#list-filter">List Filter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a List Filter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A List Filter is the SQL-like string that is provided as the parameter to an advanced Visibility List API.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#list-filter">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, Search Attributes must be added to a Workflow Execution as metadata.

  Removing custom Search Attributes is not supported on Temporal Cloud.
- To rename a custom Search Attribute on Temporal Cloud, see [`tcld namespace search-attributes rename`](/cloud/tcld/namespace#rename).

With Workflows you can do the following:

- Set the value of Search Attributes in your Workflow
- Update the value set for a Search Attribute from within the Workflow code
- Remove the value set for a Search Attribute from within the Workflow code

After you add and set your Search Attributes, use your default or custom Search Attributes in a List Filter.

<!-- commenting out this part. added this detail in how to create a custom search attribute under clusters.
The [temporalio/auto-setup](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/auto-setup) Docker image uses a pre-defined set of custom Search Attributes that are handy for testing.
