Events are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to external occurrences and Commands generated by a Workflow Execution. Each Event corresponds to an `enum` that is defined in the [Server API](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/master/temporal/api/enums/v1/event_type.proto).

All Events are recorded in the [Event History](/docs/concepts/what-is-an-event-history).

A list of all possible Events that could appear in a Workflow Execution Event History is provided below.

### WorkflowExecutionStarted

This is always the first Event in a Workflow Execution History. It indicates that the execution was invoked.

| Field Name | Type | Definition |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------- |
