An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster.
Each ping informs the Temporal Cluster that the Activity Execution is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.

- [How to Heartbeat an Activity](/application-development-guide#activity-heartbeats)

Activity Heartbeats work in conjunction with a [Heartbeat Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout).

Activity Heartbeats are implemented within the Activity Definition.
Custom progress information can be included in the Heartbeat which can then be used by the Activity Execution should a retry occur.

An Activity Heartbeat can be recorded as often as needed (e.g. once a minute or every loop iteration).
It is often a good practice to Heartbeat on anything but the shortest Activity Function Execution.
Temporal SDKs control the rate at which Heartbeats are sent to the Cluster.

Heartbeating is not required from [Local Activities](/concepts/what-is-a-local-activity), and does nothing.

For _long-running_ Activities, we recommend using a relatively short Heartbeat Timeout and a frequent Heartbeat.
That way if a Worker fails it can be handled in a timely manner.

A Heartbeat can include an application layer payload that can be used to _save_ Activity Execution progress.
If an [Activity Task Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution) times out due to a missed Heartbeat, the next Activity Task can access and continue with that payload.
