A Task Token is a unique Id that correlates to an [Activity Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution).

Activity Execution completion calls take either a single Task Token, or the [Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace), [Workflow Id](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-id), and [Activity Id](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-id) as a set of arguments.
