A Codec Server is a feature that can perform additional levels of encoding and decoding on Payloads that are handled by [tctl](/tctl/index) or the [Web UI](/web-ui/how-to-use-a-list-filter-in-the-temporal-web-ui).

- [How to set up a Codec Server](/clusters/how-to-set-up-codec-server/)

The Web UI and tctl both use a default [Data Converter](/concepts/what-is-a-data-converter), which is capable of serialization only.

Codec Servers can encrypt, compress, and change the format of a Payload object.
These measures can further secure your data.

## Use case: tctl

Suppose that you want to view Workflow History.
This information needs to be decoded before it can be viewed.

You can use [tctl workflow showid](/tctl/workflow/showid) to view a Workflow Execution Event History.

```bash
    tctl workflow showid <workflowID>
```

With a Codec Server, the Payload is decoded after being deserialized by tctl's default Data Converter. The default Data Converter sends the Payload to a given endpoint, and receives a decoded Payload if the API returns a successful result.

The Data Converter passes this result back to the command line, which prints the decoded result.

## Use case - Web UI

Workflow Execution Event History is available in the Web UI.
Payload information for each Event is captured within Event 'input' and 'result' fields.
Without a Codec Server, this information remains encoded.

Passing these Payloads through a Codec Server returns decoded results to the Web UI.
Make sure to [enter a valid URL and port](/clusters/how-to-set-up-codec-server#web-ui) for the codec endpoint when configuring the Codec Server.
