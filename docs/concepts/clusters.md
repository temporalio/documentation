This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Temporal Clusters.

A Temporal Cluster is the group of services, known as the <a class="tdlp" href="#temporal-server">Temporal Server<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is the Temporal Server?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The Temporal Server is a grouping of four horizontally scalable services.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#temporal-server">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, combined with persistence stores, that together act as a component of the Temporal Platform.

### Persistence

A Temporal Cluster's only required dependency for basic operation is a database.
Multiple types of databases are supported.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Persistence</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/temporal-database.svg" alt="Persistence" height="620" width="1140" /></div></div>

The database stores the following types of data:

- Tasks: Tasks to be dispatched.
- State of Workflow Executions:
  - Execution table: A capture of the mutable state of Workflow Executions.
  - History table: An append only log of Workflow Execution History Events.
- Namespace metadata: Metadata of each Namespace in the Cluster.
- Visibility data: Enables operations like "show all running Workflow Executions".
  For production environments, we recommend using Elasticsearch.

An Elasticsearch database must be added to enable <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#advanced-visibility">Advanced Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Advanced Visibility?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Advanced Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that enable the listing, filtering, and sorting of Workflow Executions through an SQL-like query syntax.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#advanced-visibility">Learn more</a></span></span></a> on Temporal Server versions 1.19.1 and earlier.

With Temporal Server version 1.20 and later, Advanced Visibility features are available on SQL databases like MySQL (version 8.0.17 and later), PostgreSQL (version 12 and later), SQLite (v3.31.0 and later) and Elasticsearch.

#### Dependency versions

Temporal tests compatibility by spanning the **minimum** and **maximum** stable non-EOL major versions for each supported database.
As of time of writing, these specific versions are used in our test pipelines and actively tested before we release any version of Temporal:

- **Cassandra v3.11 and v4.0**
- **PostgreSQL v10.18 and v13.4**
- **MySQL v5.7 and v8.0** (specifically 8.0.19+ due to a bug)

We update these support ranges once a year.
The release notes of each Temporal Server declare when we plan to drop support for database versions reaching End of Life.

- Because Temporal Server primarily relies on core database functionality, we do not expect compatibility to break often.
  Temporal has no opinions on database upgrade paths; as long as you can upgrade your database according to each project's specifications, Temporal should work with any version within supported ranges.
- We do not run tests with vendors like Vitess and CockroachDB, so you rely on their compatibility claims if you use them.
  Feel free to discuss them with fellow users [in our forum](https://community.temporal.io/).
- Temporal also supports SQLite v3.x persistence, but this is meant only for development and testing, not production usage.

### Monitoring and observation

Temporal emits metrics by default in a format that is supported by Prometheus.
Monitoring and observing those metrics is optional.
Any metrics software that supports the same format can be used. Currently, we test with the following Prometheus and Grafana versions:

- **Prometheus >= v2.0**
- **Grafana >= v2.5**

### Visibility

Temporal has built-in <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#">Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Visibility?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> features.
To enhance this feature, Temporal supports an <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">integration with Elasticsearch<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to integrate Elasticsearch into a Temporal Cluster</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To integrate Elasticsearch with your Temporal Cluster, edit the `persistence` section of your `development.yaml` configuration file and run the index schema setup commands.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#elasticsearch">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

- Elasticsearch v8 is supported from Temporal version 1.18.0 onwards
- Elasticsearch v7.10 is supported from Temporal version 1.7.0 onwards
- Elasticsearch v6.8 is supported up to Temporal version 1.17.x
- Elasticsearch v6.8 and v7.10 versions are explicitly supported with AWS Elasticsearch

### mTLS encryption

Temporal supports Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) as a method of encrypting network traffic between services within a Temporal Cluster, or between application processes and a Cluster.

Mutual TLS can be enabled in Temporalâ€™s [TLS configuration](/references/configuration#tls).
This configuration can be passed through `WithConfig` or `WithConfigLoader`.

This configuration includes two sections that serve to separate intra-cluster and external traffic. That way, different certificates and settings can be used to encrypt each section of traffic:

- `internode`: configuration for encrypting communication between nodes within the Cluster.
- `frontend`: configuration for encrypting the Frontend's public endpoints

### Temporal Client connections

A client's network access can be limited by using certificates issued by a specific Certificate Authority (CA).

To restrict access to Temporal Cluster endpoints, use the `clientCAFiles` or `clientCAData` property and the `requireClientAuth` property.
These properties can be specified in both the `internode` and `frontend` sections of the [mTLS configuration](/references/configuration#tls).

#### Server name specification

Specify the `serverName` in the `client` section of your mTLS configuration to prevent spoofing and [MITM attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).

Entering a value for `serverName` enables established connections to authenticate the endpoint.
This ensures that the server certificate presented to any connected client has the specified server name in its CN property.

This measure can be used for `internode` and `frontend` endpoints.

For more information on mTLS configuration, refer to our [TLS configuration guide](/references/configuration#tls).

### Auth

**Authentication** is the process of verifying users who want to access your application are actually the users you want accessing it.
**Authorization** is the verification of applications and data that a user on your Cluster or application has access to.

Temporal has several authentication protocols that can be set to restrict access to your data.
These protocols address three areas: servers, client connections, and users.

Server attacks can be prevented by specifying `serverName` in the `client` section of your mTLS configuration.
This can be done for both `frontend` and `internode` endpoints.

Client connections can be restricted to certain endpoints by requiring certificates from a specific CA.
Modify the `clientCaFiles`, `clientCaData`, and `requireClientAuth` properties in the `internode` and `frontend` sections of the mTLS configuration.

User access can be restricted through extensibility points and plugins.
When implemented, the `frontend` invokes the plugin before executing the requested operation.

Temporal offers two plugin interfaces for API call authentication and authorization.

- <a class="tdlp" href="/security#claim-mapper"> `ClaimMapper`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a ClaimMapper Plugin?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The Claim Mapper component is a pluggable component that extracts Claims from JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#claim-mapper">Learn more</a></span></span></a>
- <a class="tdlp" href="/security#authorizer-plugin"> `Authorizer`<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Authorizer Plugin?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">undefined</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/security#authorizer-plugin">Learn more</a></span></span></a>

The logic of both plugins can be customized to fit a variety of use cases.
When provided, the frontend invokes the implementation of the plugins before running the requested operation.

## Temporal Server

The Temporal Server consists of four independently scalable services:

- Frontend gateway: for rate limiting, routing, authorizing.
- History subsystem: maintains data (mutable state, queues, and timers).
- Matching subsystem: hosts Task Queues for dispatching.
- Worker Service: for internal background Workflows.

For example, a real-life production deployment can have 5 Frontend, 15 History, 17 Matching, and 3 Worker Services per cluster.

The Temporal Server services can run independently or be grouped together into shared processes on one or more physical or virtual machines.
For live (production) environments, we recommend that each service runs independently, because each one has different scaling requirements and troubleshooting becomes easier.
The History, Matching, and Worker Services can scale horizontally within a Cluster.
The Frontend Service scales differently than the others because it has no sharding or partitioning; it is just stateless.

Each service is aware of the others, including scaled instances, through a membership protocol via [Ringpop](https://github.com/temporalio/ringpop-go).

#### Versions and support

All Temporal Server releases abide by the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/).

Fairly precise upgrade paths and support have been established starting from Temporal `v1.7.0`.

We provide maintenance support for previously published minor and major versions by continuing to release critical bug fixes related to security, the prevention of data loss, and reliability, whenever they are found.

We aim to publish incremental upgrade guides for each minor and major version, which include specifics about dependency upgrades that we have tested for (such as Cassandra 3.0 -> 3.11).

We offer maintenance support of the last three **minor** versions after a release and do not plan to "backport" patches beyond that.

We offer maintenance support of **major** versions for at least 12 months after a GA release, and we provide at least 6 months' notice before EOL/deprecating support.

#### Dependencies

Temporal offers official support for, and is tested against, dependencies with the exact versions described in the `go.mod` file of the corresponding release tag.
(For example, [v1.5.1](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/tree/v1.5.1) dependencies are documented in [the go.mod for v1.5.1](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.5.1/go.mod).)

### Frontend Service

The Frontend Service is a stateless gateway service that exposes a strongly typed [Proto API](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/master/temporal/api/workflowservice/v1/service.proto).
The Frontend Service is responsible for rate limiting, authorizing, validating, and routing all inbound calls.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Frontend Service</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/temporal-frontend-service.svg" alt="Frontend Service" height="1040" width="1140" /></div></div>

Types of inbound calls include the following:

- <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Namespace<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> CRUD
- External events
- Worker polls
- <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#">Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Visibility?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">The term Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, refers to the subsystems and APIs that enable an operator to view Workflow Executions that currently exist within a Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> requests
- [tctl](/tctl-v1) (the Temporal CLI) operations
- Calls from a remote Cluster related to <a class="tdlp" href="#multi-cluster-replication">Multi-Cluster Replication<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Multi-Cluster Replication?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Multi-Cluster Replication is a feature which asynchronously replicates Workflow Executions from active Clusters to other passive Clusters, for backup and state reconstruction.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#multi-cluster-replication">Learn more</a></span></span></a>

Every inbound request related to a Workflow Execution must have a Workflow Id, which is hashed for routing purposes.
The Frontend Service has access to the hash rings that maintain service membership information, including how many nodes (instances of each service) are in the Cluster.

Inbound call rate limiting is applied per host and per namespace.

The Frontend Service talks to the Matching Service, History Service, Worker Service, the database, and Elasticsearch (if in use).

- It uses the grpcPort 7233 to host the service handler.
- It uses port 6933 for membership-related communication.

Ports are configurable in the Cluster configuration.

### History Service

The History Service is responsible for persisting Workflow Execution state and determining what to do next to progress the Workflow Execution by using <a class="tdlp" href="#history-shard">History Shards<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a History Shard?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A History Shard is an important unit within a Temporal Cluster by which the scale of concurrent Workflow Execution throughput can be measured.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#history-shard">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">History Service</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/temporal-history-service.svg" alt="History Service" height="1040" width="1140" /></div></div>

The total number of History Services can be between 1 and the total number of History Shards.
An individual History Service can support a large number of History Shards.
Temporal recommends starting at a ratio of 1 History Service for every 500 History Shards.

Although the total number of History Shards remains static for the life of the Cluster, the number of History Services can change.

The History Service talks to the Matching Service and the database.

- It uses grpcPort 7234 to host the service handler.
- It uses port 6934 for membership-related communication.

Ports are configurable in the Cluster configuration.

#### History Shard

A History Shard is an important unit within a Temporal Cluster by which the scale of concurrent Workflow Execution throughput can be measured.

Each History Shard maps to a single persistence partition.
A History Shard assumes that only one concurrent operation can be within a partition at a time.
In essence, the number of History Shards represents the number of concurrent database operations that can occur for a Cluster.
This means that the number of History Shards in a Temporal Cluster plays a significant role in the performance of your Temporal Application.

Before integrating a database, the total number of History Shards for the Temporal Cluster must be chosen and set in the Cluster's configuration (see [persistence](/references/configuration#persistence)).
After the Shard count is configured and the database integrated, the total number of History Shards for the Cluster cannot be changed.

In theory, a Temporal Cluster can operate with an unlimited number of History Shards, but each History Shard adds compute overhead to the Cluster.
Temporal Clusters have operated successfully using anywhere from 1 to 128K History Shards, with each Shard responsible for tens of thousands of Workflow Executions.
One Shard is useful only in small scale setups designed for testing, while 128k Shards is useful only in very large scale production environments.
The correct number of History Shards for any given Cluster depends entirely on the Temporal Application that it is supporting and the type of database.

A History Shard is represented as a hashed integer.
Each Workflow Execution is automatically assigned to a History Shard.
The assignment algorithm hashes Workflow Execution metadata such as Workflow Id and Namespace and uses that value to match a History Shard.

Each History Shard maintains the Workflow Execution Event History, Workflow Execution mutable state, and the following internal Task Queues:

- Internal Transfer Task Queue: Transfers internal tasks to the Matching Service.
  Whenever a new Workflow Task needs to be scheduled, the History Service's Transfer Task Queue Processor transactionally dispatches it to the Matching Service.
- Internal Timer Task Queue: Durably persists Timers.
- Internal Replicator Task Queue: Asynchronously replicates Workflow Executions from active Clusters to other passive Clusters.
  (Relies on the experimental Multi-Cluster feature.)
- Internal Visibility Task Queue: Pushes data to the <a class="tdlp" href="/visibility#advanced-visibility">Advanced Visibility<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Advanced Visibility?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Advanced Visibility, within the Temporal Platform, is the subsystem and APIs that enable the listing, filtering, and sorting of Workflow Executions through an SQL-like query syntax.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/visibility#advanced-visibility">Learn more</a></span></span></a> index.

### Matching Service

The Matching Service is responsible for hosting user-facing <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#task-queue">Task Queues<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Task Queue?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Task Queue is a first-in, first-out queue that a Worker Process polls for Tasks.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#task-queue">Learn more</a></span></span></a> for Task dispatching.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Matching Service</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/temporal-matching-service.svg" alt="Matching Service" height="980" width="870" /></div></div>

It is responsible for matching Workers to Tasks and routing new Tasks to the appropriate queue.
This service can scale internally by having multiple instances.

It talks to the Frontend Service, History Service, and the database.

- It uses grpcPort 7235 to host the service handler.
- It uses port 6935 for membership related communication.

Ports are configurable in the Cluster configuration.

### Worker Service

The Worker Service runs background processing for the replication queue, system Workflows, and (in versions older than 1.5.0) the Kafka visibility processor.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Worker Service</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/temporal-worker-service.svg" alt="Worker Service" height="740" width="1140" /></div></div>

It talks to the Frontend Service.

- It uses port 6939 for membership-related communication.

Ports are configurable in the Cluster configuration.

### Retention Period

Retention Period is the duration for which the Temporal Cluster stores data associated with closed Workflow Executions on a Namespace in the Persistence store.

- [How to set the Retention Period for a Namespace](/tctl-v1/namespace#register)
- <a class="tdlp" href="/dev-guide/go/features#namespaces">How to set the Retention Period for a Namespace using the Go SDK<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create and manage Namespaces</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">You can create, update, deprecate or delete your Namespaces using either tctl or SDK APIs..</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dev-guide/go/features#namespaces">Learn more</a></span></span></a>
- <a class="tdlp" href="/dev-guide/java/features#namespaces">How to set the Retention Period for a Namespace using the Java SDK<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create and manage Namespaces</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">You can create, update, deprecate or delete your Namespaces using either tctl or SDK APIs..</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dev-guide/java/features#namespaces">Learn more</a></span></span></a>

A Retention Period applies to all closed Workflow Executions within a <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#">Namespace<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and is set when the Namespace is registered.

The Temporal Cluster triggers a Timer task at the end of the Retention Period that cleans up the data associated with the closed Workflow Execution on that Namespace.

The minimum Retention Period is 1 day.
On Temporal Cluster version 1.18 and later, the maximum Retention Period value for Namespaces can be set to anything over the minimum requirement of 1 day. Ensure that your Persistence store has enough capacity for the storage.
On Temporal Cluster versions 1.17 and earlier, the maximum Retention Period you can set is 30 days.
Setting the Retention Period to 0 results in the error _A valid retention period is not set on request_.

If you don't set the Retention Period value when using the [`tctl namespace register`](/tctl-v1/namespace#register) command, it defaults to 3 days.
If you don't set the Retention Period value when using the Register Namespace Request API, it returns an error.

<!-- TODO link up to working API usage examples -->

## Archival

Archival is a feature that automatically backs up <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#event-history">Event Histories<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Event History?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An append log of Events that represents the full state a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#event-history">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and Visibility records from Temporal Cluster persistence to a custom blob store.

- <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#custom-archiver">How to create a custom Archiver<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to create a custom Archiver</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">To archive data with a given provider, using the Archival feature, Temporal must have a corresponding Archiver component installed.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#custom-archiver">Learn more</a></span></span></a>
- <a class="tdlp" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#set-up-archival">How to set up Archival<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">How to set up Archival</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">This guide covers Temporal's archiving capabilities and how to set up the Archival feature.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cluster-deployment-guide#set-up-archival">Learn more</a></span></span></a>

Workflow Execution Event Histories are backed up after the <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#retention-period">Retention Period<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#retention-period">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is reached.
Visibility records are backed up immediately after a Workflow Execution reaches a Closed status.

Archival enables Workflow Execution data to persist as long as needed, while not overwhelming the Cluster's persistence store.

This feature is helpful for compliance and debugging.

Temporal's Archival feature is considered **experimental** and not subject to normal [versioning and support policy](/clusters).

Archival is not supported when running Temporal through Docker and is disabled by default when installing the system manually and when deploying through [helm charts](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts/blob/master/templates/server-configmap.yaml) (but can be enabled in the [config](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/config/development.yaml)).

## Multi-Cluster Replication

Multi-Cluster Replication is a feature which asynchronously replicates Workflow Executions from active Clusters to other passive Clusters, for backup and state reconstruction.
When necessary, for higher availability, Cluster operators can failover to any of the backup Clusters.

Temporal's Multi-Cluster Replication feature is considered **experimental** and not subject to normal [versioning and support policy](/clusters).

Temporal automatically forwards Start, Signal, and Query requests to the active Cluster.
This feature must be enabled through a Dynamic Config flag per <a class="tdlp" href="/namespaces#global-namespace">Global Namespace<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Global Namespace?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Global Namespace is a Namespace that exists across Clusters when Multi-Cluster Replication is set up.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/namespaces#global-namespace">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

When the feature is enabled, Tasks are sent to the Parent Task Queue partition that matches that Namespace, if it exists.

All Visibility APIs can be used against active and standby Clusters.
This enables [Temporal UI](https://docs.temporal.io/web-ui) to work seamlessly for Global Namespaces.
Applications making API calls directly to the Temporal Visibility API continue to work even if a Global Namespace is in standby mode.
However, they might see a lag due to replication delay when querying the Workflow Execution state from a standby Cluster.

#### Namespace Versions

A _version_ is a concept in Multi-Cluster Replication that describes the chronological order of events per Namespace.

With Multi-Cluster Replication, all Namespace change events and Workflow Execution History events are replicated asynchronously for high throughput.
This means that data across clusters is **not** strongly consistent.
To guarantee that Namespace data and Workflow Execution data will achieve eventual consistency (especially when there is a data conflict during a failover), a **version** is introduced and attached to Namespaces.
All Workflow Execution History entries generated in a Namespace will also come with the version attached to that Namespace.

All participating Clusters are pre-configured with a unique initial version and a shared version increment:

- `initial version < shared version increment`

When performing failover for a Namespace from one Cluster to another Cluster, the version attached to the Namespace will be changed by the following rule:

- for all versions which follow `version % (shared version increment) == (active cluster's initial version)`, find the smallest version which has `version >= old version in namespace`

When there is a data conflict, a comparison will be made and Workflow Execution History entries with the highest version will be considered the source of truth.

When a cluster is trying to mutate a Workflow Execution History, the version will be checked.
A cluster can mutate a Workflow Execution History only if the following is true:

- The version in the Namespace belongs to this cluster, i.e.
  `(version in namespace) % (shared version increment) == (this cluster's initial version)`
- The version of this Workflow Execution History's last entry (event) is equal or less than the version in the Namespace, i.e.
  `(last event's version) <= (version in namespace)`

<details>
<summary>Namespace version change example
</summary>

Assuming the following scenario:

- Cluster A comes with initial version: 1
- Cluster B comes with initial version: 2
- Shared version increment: 10

T = 0: Namespace Î± is registered, with active Cluster set to Cluster A

```
namespace Î±'s version is 1
all workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 1
```

T = 1: namespace Î² is registered, with active Cluster set to Cluster B

```
namespace Î²'s version is 2
all workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 2
```

T = 2: Namespace Î± is updated to with active Cluster set to Cluster B

```
namespace Î±'s version is 2
all workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 2
```

T = 3: Namespace Î² is updated to with active Cluster set to Cluster A

```
namespace Î²'s version is 11
all workflows events generated within this namespace, will come with version 11
```

</details>

#### Version history

Version history is a concept which provides a high level summary of version information in regards to Workflow Execution History.

Whenever there is a new Workflow Execution History entry generated, the version from Namespace will be attached.
The Workflow Executions's mutable state will keep track of all history entries (events) and the corresponding version.

<details>
<summary>Version history example (without data conflict)
</summary>

Since Temporal is AP, during failover (change of active Temporal Cluster Namespace), there can exist cases where more than one Cluster can modify a Workflow Execution, causing divergence of Workflow Execution History. Below shows how the version history will look like under such conditions.

#### Conflict resolution

When a Workflow Execution History diverges, proper conflict resolution is applied.

In Multi-cluster Replication, Workflow Execution History Events are modeled as a tree, as shown in the second example in [Version History](#version-history).

Workflow Execution Histories that diverge will have more than one history branch.
Among all history branches, the history branch with the highest version is considered the `current branch` and the Workflow Execution's mutable state is a summary of the current branch.
Whenever there is a switch between Workflow Execution History branches, a complete rebuild of the Workflow Execution's mutable state will occur.

Temporal Multi-Cluster Replication relies on asynchronous replication of Events across Clusters, so in the case of a failover it is possible to have an Activity Task dispatched again to the newly active Cluster due to a replication task lag.
This also means that whenever a Workflow Execution is updated after a failover by the new Cluster, any previous replication tasks for that Execution cannot be applied.
This results in loss of some progress made by the Workflow Execution in the previous active Cluster.
During such conflict resolution, Temporal re-injects any external Events like Signals in the new Event History before discarding replication tasks.
Even though some progress could roll back during failovers, Temporal provides the guarantee that Workflow Executions wonâ€™t get stuck and will continue to make forward progress.

Activity Execution completions are not forwarded across Clusters.
Any outstanding Activities will eventually time out based on the configuration.
Your application should have retry logic in place so that the Activity gets retried and dispatched again to a Worker after the failover to the new Cluster.
Handling this is similar to handling an Activity Task timeout caused by a Worker restarting.

#### Zombie Workflows

There is an existing contract that for any Namespace and Workflow Id combination, there can be at most one run (Namespace + Workflow Id + Run Id) open / executing.

Multi-cluster Replication aims to keep the Workflow Execution History as up-to-date as possible among all participating Clusters.

Due to the nature of Multi-cluster Replication (for example, Workflow Execution History events are replicated asynchronously) different Runs (same Namespace and Workflow Id) can arrive at the target Cluster at different times, sometimes out of order, as shown below:

```
| ------------- |          | ------------- |          | ------------- |
| Cluster A |  | Network Layer |  | Cluster B |
| --------- || ------------- |          | ------------- |
        |                          |                          |
        | Run 1 Replication Events |                          |
        | -----------------------> |                          |
        |                          |                          |
        | Run 2 Replication Events |                          |
        | -----------------------> |                          |
        |                          |                          |
        |                          |                          |
        |                          |                          |
        |                          | Run 2 Replication Events |
        |                          | -----------------------> |
        |                          |                          |
        |                          | Run 1 Replication Events |
        |                          | -----------------------> |
        |     |  |
        | --- || ------------- |          | ------------- |
| Cluster A |  | Network Layer |  | Cluster B |
| --------- || ------------- |          | ------------- |
```

Because Run 2 appears in Cluster B first, Run 1 cannot be replicated as "runnable" due to the rule `at most one Run open` (see above), thus the "zombie" Workflow Execution state is introduced.
A "zombie" state is one in which a Workflow Execution which cannot be actively mutated by a Cluster (assuming the corresponding Namespace is active in this Cluster). A zombie Workflow Execution can only be changed by a replication Task.

Run 1 will be replicated similar to Run 2, except when Run 1's execution will become a "zombie" before Run 1 reaches completion.

#### Workflow Task processing

In the context of Multi-cluster Replication, a Workflow Execution's mutable state is an entity which tracks all pending tasks.
Prior to the introduction of Multi-cluster Replication, Workflow Execution History entries (events) are from a single branch, and the Temporal Server will only append new entries (events) to the Workflow Execution History.

After the introduction of Multi-cluster Replication, it is possible that a Workflow Execution can have multiple Workflow Execution History branches.
Tasks generated according to one history branch may become invalidated by switching history branches during conflict resolution.

Example:

T = 0: task A is generated according to Event Id: 4, version: 2

```
| -------- | ------------- |
| Events   |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Event ID | Event Version |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 1        | 1             |
| 2        | 1             |
| 3        | 2             |
| -------- | ------------- |
|          |
|          |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Event ID | Event Version |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 4        | 2             | <-- task A belongs to this event |
| -------- | ------------- |
```

T = 1: conflict resolution happens, Workflow Execution's mutable state is rebuilt and history Event Id: 4, version: 3 is written down to persistence

```
| -------- | ------------- |
| Events        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Event ID      | Event Version                                |
| --------      | -------------                                |
| 1             | 1                                            |
| 2             | 1                                            |
| 3             | 2                                            |
| --------      | -------------                                |
|               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
|               |
| --------      | -------------                                |                                  | -------- | ------------- |
| Event ID      | Event Version                                |                                  | Event ID | Event Version |
| --------      | -------------                                |                                  | -------- | ------------- |
| 4             | 2                                            | <-- task A belongs to this event | 4        | 3             | <-- current branch / mutable state |
| --------      | -------------                                |                                  | -------- | ------------- |
```

T = 2: task A is loaded.

At this time, due to the rebuild of a Workflow Execution's mutable state (conflict resolution), Task A is no longer relevant (Task A's corresponding Event belongs to non-current branch).
Task processing logic will verify both the Event Id and version of the Task against a corresponding Workflow Execution's mutable state, then discard task A.
