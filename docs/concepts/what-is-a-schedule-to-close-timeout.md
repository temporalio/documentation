A Schedule-To-Close Timeout is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall [Activity Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-execution), from when the first [Activity Task](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task) is scheduled to when the last Activity Task, in the chain of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution, reaches a Closed status.

Example Schedule-To-Close Timeout period for an Activity Execution that has a chain Activity Task Executions:

**The default Schedule-To-Close Timeout is âˆž (infinity).**

An Activity Execution must have either this timeout (Schedule-To-Close) or [Start-To-Close](/concepts/what-is-a-start-to-close-timeout) set.
By default, an Activity Execution Retry Policy dictates that retries will occur for up to 10 years.
This timeout can be used to control the overall duration of an Activity Execution in the face of failures (repeated Activity Task Executions), without altering the Maximum Attempts field of the Retry Policy.
