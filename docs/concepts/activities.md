This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Temporal Activities.

In day-to-day conversation, the term _Activity_ denotes an <a class="tdlp" href="#activity-definition">Activity Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#activity-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, <a class="tdlp" href="#activity-type">Activity Type<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Type?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Type is the mapping of a name to an Activity Definition.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#activity-type">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, or <a class="tdlp" href="#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
Temporal documentation aims to be explicit and differentiate between them.

An Activity is a normal function or method that executes a single, well-defined action (either short or long running), such as calling another service, transcoding a media file, or sending an email message.
Activity code can be non-deterministic.
We recommend that it be [idempotent](/activities#idempotency).

Workflow code orchestrates the execution of Activities, persisting the results.
If an Activity Function Execution fails, any future execution starts from initial state (except <a class="tdlp" href="#activity-heartbeat">Heartbeats<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Heartbeat?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster. Each ping informs the Temporal Cluster that the Activity Execution is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#activity-heartbeat">Learn more</a></span></span></a>).

Activity Functions are executed by Worker Processes.
When the Activity Function returns, the Worker sends the results back to the Temporal Cluster as part of the [ActivityTaskCompleted](/references/events#activitytaskcompleted) Event.
The Event is added to the Workflow Execution's Event History.
For other Activity-related Events, see [Activity Events](/workflows#activity-events).

## Activity Definition

An Activity Definition is the code that defines the constraints of an <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Activity Task Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task Execution occurs when a Worker uses the context provided from the Activity Task and executes the Activity Definition.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

The term 'Activity Definition' is used to refer to the full set of primitives in any given language SDK that provides an access point to an Activity Function Definition——the method or function that is invoked for an <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Activity Task Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task Execution occurs when a Worker uses the context provided from the Activity Task and executes the Activity Definition.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
Therefore, the terms Activity Function and Activity Method refer to the source of an instance of an execution.

Activity Definitions are named and referenced in code by their <a class="tdlp" href="#activity-type">Activity Type<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Type?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Type is the mapping of a name to an Activity Definition.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#activity-type">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

#### Idempotency

Temporal recommends that Activities be idempotent.

An Activity is idempotent if multiple <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Activity Task Executions<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task Execution occurs when a Worker uses the context provided from the Activity Task and executes the Activity Definition.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a> do not change the state of the system beyond the first Activity Task Execution.

We recommend using idempotency keys for critical side effects.

The lack of idempotency might affect the correctness of your application but does not affect the Temporal Platform.
In other words, lack of idempotency does not lead to a platform error.

In some cases, whether something is idempotent does not affect the correctness of an application.
For example, if you have a monotonically incrementing counter, you might not care that retries increment the counter because you don’t care about the actual value, only that the current value is greater than a previous value.

#### Constraints

Activity Definitions are executed as normal functions.

In the event of failure, the function begins at its initial state when retried (except when Activity Heartbeats are established).

Therefore, an Activity Definition has no restrictions on the code it contains.

#### Parameters

An Activity Definition can support as many parameters as needed.

All values passed through these parameters are recorded in the <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#event-history">Event History<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Event History?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An append log of Events that represents the full state a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#event-history">Learn more</a></span></span></a> of the Workflow Execution.
Return values are also captured in the Event History for the calling Workflow Execution.

Activity Definitions must contain the following parameters:

- Context: an optional parameter that provides Activity context within multiple APIs.
- Heartbeat: a notification from the Worker to the Temporal Cluster that the Activity Execution is progressing. Cancelations are allowed only if the Activity Definition permits Heartbeating.
- Timeouts: intervals that control the execution and retrying of Activity Task Executions.

Other parameters, such as <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#">Retry Policies<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and return values, can be seen in the implementation guides, listed in the next section.

### Activity Type

An Activity Type is the mapping of a name to an Activity Definition.

Activity Types are scoped through Task Queues.

## Activity Execution

An Activity Execution is the full chain of <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Activity Task Executions<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task Execution occurs when a Worker uses the context provided from the Activity Task and executes the Activity Definition.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

By default, an Activity Execution has no time limit.
Activity Execution timeouts](/concepts/what-is-a-start-to-close-timeout) and <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#">retry policies<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> can be customized.

If an Activity Execution fails (because it exhausted all retries, threw a <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#non-retryable-errors">non-retryable error<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#non-retryable-errors">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, or was canceled), the error is returned to the [Workflow](/workflows), which decides how to handle it.

### Cancellation

Activity Cancellation:

- lets the Activity know it doesn't need to keep doing work, and
- gives the Activity time to clean up any resources it has created.

Activities can only receive Cancellation if they emit Heartbeats or in Core-based SDKs (TypeScript/Python) are Local Activities (which don't heartbeat but receive Cancellation anyway).

An Activity may receive Cancellation if:

- The Activity was requested to be Cancelled. This can often cascade from Workflow Cancellation, but not always—SDKs have ways to stop Cancellation from cascading. <!-- TODO link to workflow cancellation -->
- The Activity was considered failed by the Server because any of the Activity timeouts have triggered (for example, the Server didn't receive a heartbeat within the Activity's Heartbeat timeout). The [Cancelled Failure](/kb/failures#cancelled-failure) that the Activity receives will have `message: 'TIMED_OUT'`.
- The Workflow Run reached a [Closed state](/workflows#status), in which case the Cancelled Failure will have `message: 'NOT_FOUND'`.
- In some SDKs:
  - The Worker is shutting down.
  - An Activity sends a Heartbeat but the Heartbeat details can't be converted by the Worker's configured <a class="tdlp" href="/dataconversion#">Data Converter<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Data Converter?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Data Converter is a Temporal SDK component that serializes and encodes data entering and exiting a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/dataconversion#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>. This fails the Activity Task Execution with an Application Failure.

There are different ways to receive Cancellation depending on the SDK. <!-- TODO link to dev guide -->
An Activity may accept or ignore Cancellation:

- To allow Cancellation to happen, let the Cancellation Failure propagate.
- To ignore Cancellation, catch it and continue executing.

Some SDKs have ways to shield tasks from being stopped while still letting the Cancellation propagate.

The Workflow can also decide if it wants to wait for the Activity Cancellation to be accepted or to proceed without waiting.

Cancellation can only be requested a single time.
If you try to cancel your Activity Execution more than once, it will not receive more than one Cancellation request.

### Activity Id

The identifier for an <a class="tdlp" href="#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
The identifier can be generated by the system, or it can be provided by the Workflow code that spawns the Activity Execution.
The identifier is unique among the open Activity Executions of a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#run-id">Workflow Run<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Run Id?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Run Id is a globally unique, platform-level identifier for a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#run-id">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
(A single Workflow Run may reuse an Activity Id if an earlier Activity Execution with the same Id has closed.)

An Activity Id can be used to <a class="tdlp" href="#asynchronous-activity-completion">complete the Activity asynchronously<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Asynchronous Activity Completion?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Asynchronous Activity Completion occurs when an external system provides the final result of a computation, started by an Activity, to the Temporal System.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#asynchronous-activity-completion">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

### Schedule-To-Start Timeout

A Schedule-To-Start Timeout is the maximum amount of time that is allowed from when an <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task">Activity Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task contains the context needed to make an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is scheduled (that is, placed in a Task Queue) to when a <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#">Worker<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Worker?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">In day-to-day conversations, the term Worker is used to denote both a Worker Program and a Worker Process.

In other words, it's a limit for how long an Activity Task can be enqueued.

The moment that the Task is picked by the Worker from the Task Queue is considered to be the start of the Activity Task for the purposes of the Schedule-To-Start Timeout and associated metrics.
This definition of "Start" avoids issues that a clock difference between the Temporal Cluster and a Worker might create.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Schedule-To-Start Timeout period</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/schedule-to-start-timeout.svg" alt="Schedule-To-Start Timeout period" height="666" width="1120" /></div></div>

"Schedule" in Schedule-To-Start and Schedule-To-Close have different frequency guarantees.

The Schedule-To-Start Timeout is enforced for each Activity Task, whereas the Schedule-To-Close Timeout is enforced once per Activity Execution.
Thus, "Schedule" in Schedule-To-Start refers to the scheduling moment of _every_ Activity Task in the sequence of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution, while
"Schedule" in Schedule-To-Close refers to the _first_ Activity Task in that sequence.

A <a class="tdlp" href="/retry-policies#">Retry Policy<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Retry Policy?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/retry-policies#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> attached to an Activity Execution retries an Activity Task.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Start-To-Close Timeout period with retries</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/schedule-to-start-timeout-with-retry.svg" alt="Start-To-Close Timeout period with retries" height="1246" width="1601" /></div></div>

This timeout has two primary use cases:

1. Detect whether an individual Worker has crashed.
2. Detect whether the fleet of Workers polling the Task Queue is not able to keep up with the rate of Activity Tasks.

**The default Schedule-To-Start Timeout is ∞ (infinity).**

If this timeout is used, we recommend setting this timeout to the maximum time a Workflow Execution is willing to wait for an Activity Execution in the presence of all possible Worker outages, and have a concrete plan in place to reroute Activity Tasks to a different Task Queue.
This timeout **does not** trigger any retries regardless of the Retry Policy, as a retry would place the Activity Task back into the same Task Queue.
We do not recommend using this timeout unless you know what you are doing.

In most cases, we recommend monitoring the `temporal_activity_schedule_to_start_latency` metric to know when Workers slow down picking up Activity Tasks, instead of setting this timeout.

### Start-To-Close Timeout

An Activity Execution must have either this timeout (Start-To-Close) or the <a class="tdlp" href="#schedule-to-close-timeout">Schedule-To-Close Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Schedule-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Schedule-To-Close Timeout is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall Activity Execution, from when the first Activity Task is scheduled to when the last Activity Task, in the chain of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution, reaches a Closed status.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#schedule-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> set.
We recommend always setting this timeout; however, make sure that it is always set to be longer than the maximum possible time for the Activity Execution to take place.
For long running Activity Executions, we recommend also using <a class="tdlp" href="#activity-heartbeat">Activity Heartbeats<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Heartbeat?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster.

The main use case for the Start-To-Close timeout is to detect when a Worker crashes after it has started executing an Activity Task.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Start-To-Close Timeout period</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/start-to-close-timeout.svg" alt="Start-To-Close Timeout period" height="666" width="1119" /></div></div>

Thus, the Start-To-Close Timeout is applied to each Activity Task Execution within an Activity Execution.

If the first Activity Task Execution returns an error the first time, then the full Activity Execution might look like this:

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Start-To-Close Timeout period with retries</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/start-to-close-timeout-with-retry.svg" alt="Start-To-Close Timeout period with retries" height="1246" width="1601" /></div></div>

If this timeout is reached, the following actions occur:

- An [ActivityTaskTimedOut](/references/events/#activitytasktimedout) Event is written to the Workflow Execution's mutable state.
- If a Retry Policy dictates a retry, the Temporal Cluster schedules another Activity Task.
  - The attempt count increments by 1 in the Workflow Execution's mutable state.
  - The Start-To-Close Timeout timer is reset.

### Schedule-To-Close Timeout

A Schedule-To-Close Timeout is the maximum amount of time allowed for the overall <a class="tdlp" href="#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, from when the first <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task">Activity Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task contains the context needed to make an Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is scheduled to when the last Activity Task, in the chain of Activity Tasks that make up the Activity Execution, reaches a Closed status.

Example Schedule-To-Close Timeout period for an Activity Execution that has a chain Activity Task Executions:

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Schedule-To-Close Timeout period with a retry</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/schedule-to-close-timeout-with-retry.svg" alt="Schedule-To-Close Timeout period with a retry" height="1246" width="1540" /></div></div>

**The default Schedule-To-Close Timeout is ∞ (infinity).**

An Activity Execution must have either this timeout (Schedule-To-Close) or <a class="tdlp" href="#start-to-close-timeout">Start-To-Close<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Start-To-Close Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Start-To-Close Timeout is the maximum time allowed for a single Activity Task Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#start-to-close-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a> set.
By default, an Activity Execution Retry Policy dictates that retries will occur for up to 10 years.
This timeout can be used to control the overall duration of an Activity Execution in the face of failures (repeated Activity Task Executions), without altering the Maximum Attempts field of the Retry Policy.

### Activity Heartbeat

An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster.
Each ping informs the Temporal Cluster that the Activity Execution is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.

Activity Heartbeats work in conjunction with a <a class="tdlp" href="#heartbeat-timeout">Heartbeat Timeout<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Heartbeat Timeout?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Heartbeat Timeout is the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#heartbeat-timeout">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

Activity Heartbeats are implemented within the Activity Definition.
Custom progress information can be included in the Heartbeat which can then be used by the Activity Execution should a retry occur.

An Activity Heartbeat can be recorded as often as needed (e.g. once a minute or every loop iteration).
It is often a good practice to Heartbeat on anything but the shortest Activity Function Execution.
Temporal SDKs control the rate at which Heartbeats are sent to the Cluster.

Heartbeating is not required from <a class="tdlp" href="#local-activity">Local Activities<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Local Activity?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Local Activity is an Activity Execution that executes in the same process as the Workflow Execution that spawns it.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#local-activity">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, and does nothing.

For _long-running_ Activities, we recommend using a relatively short Heartbeat Timeout and a frequent Heartbeat.
That way if a Worker fails it can be handled in a timely manner.

A Heartbeat can include an application layer payload that can be used to _save_ Activity Execution progress.
If an <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Activity Task Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task Execution occurs when a Worker uses the context provided from the Activity Task and executes the Activity Definition.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a> times out due to a missed Heartbeat, the next Activity Task can access and continue with that payload.

Activity Cancellations are delivered to Activities from the Cluster when they Heartbeat. Activities that don't Heartbeat can't receive a Cancellation.
Heartbeat throttling may lead to Cancellation getting delivered later than expected.

#### Throttling

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Cluster—they may be throttled by the Worker.
The throttle interval is the smaller of the following:

- If `heartbeatTimeout` is provided, `heartbeatTimeout * 0.8`; otherwise, `defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval`
- `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval`

`defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval` is 30 seconds by default, and `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval` is 60 seconds by default.
Each can be set in Worker options.

Throttling is implemented as follows:

- After sending a Heartbeat, the Worker sets a timer for the throttle interval.
- The Worker stops sending Heartbeats, but continues receiving Heartbeats from the Activity and remembers the most recent one.
- When the timer fires, the Worker:
  - Sends the most recent Heartbeat.
  - Sets the timer again.

#### Which Activities should Heartbeat?

Heartbeating is best thought about not in terms of time, but in terms of "How do you know you are making progress?"
For short-term operations, progress updates are not a requirement.
However, checking the progress and status of Activity Executions that run over long periods is almost always useful.

Consider the following when setting Activity Hearbeats:

- Your underlying task must be able to report definite progress.
  Note that your Workflow cannot read this progress information while the Activity is still executing (or it would have to store it in Event History).
  You can report progress to external sources if you need it exposed to the user.

- Your Activity Execution is long-running, and you need to verify whether the Worker that is processing your Activity is still alive and has not run out of memory or silently crashed.

For example, the following scenarios are suitable for Heartbeating:

- Reading a large file from Amazon S3.
- Running a ML training job on some local GPUs.

And the following scenarios are not suitable for Heartbeating:

- Making a quick API call.
- Reading a small file from disk.

### Asynchronous Activity Completion

Asynchronous Activity Completion is a feature that enables an Activity Function to return without causing the Activity Execution to complete.
The Temporal Client can then be used to both Heartbeat Activity Execution progress and eventually provide a result.

#### When to use Async Completion

The intended use-case for this feature is when an external system has the final result of a computation, started by an Activity.

Consider using Asynchronous Activities instead of Signals if the external process is unreliable and might fail to send critical status updates through a Signal.

Consider using <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#signal">Signals<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Signal?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Signal is an asynchronous request to a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#signal">Learn more</a></span></span></a> as an alternative to Asynchronous Activities to return data back to a Workflow Execution if there is a human in the process loop.
The reason is that a human in the loop means multiple steps in the process.
The first is the Activity Function that stores state in an external system and at least one other step where a human would “complete” the activity.
If the first step fails, you want to detect that quickly and retry instead of waiting for the entire process, which could be significantly longer when humans are involved.

#### Task Token

A Task Token is a unique identifier for an <a class="tdlp" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Activity Task Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Task Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Task Execution occurs when a Worker uses the context provided from the Activity Task and executes the Activity Definition.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/tasks#activity-task-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

<a class="tdlp" href="#asynchronous-activity-completion">Asynchronous Activity Completion<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Asynchronous Activity Completion?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Asynchronous Activity Completion occurs when an external system provides the final result of a computation, started by an Activity, to the Temporal System.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#asynchronous-activity-completion">Learn more</a></span></span></a> calls take either of the following as arguments:

## Local Activity

A Local Activity is an <a class="tdlp" href="#activity-execution">Activity Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is an Activity Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">An Activity Execution is the full chain of Activity Task Executions.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#activity-execution">Learn more</a></span></span></a> that executes in the same process as the [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) that spawns it.

Some Activity Executions are very short-living and do not need the queuing semantic, flow control, rate limiting, and routing capabilities.
For this case, Temporal supports the Local Activity feature.

The main benefit of Local Activities is that they use less Temporal Cluster resources (for example, fewer History events) and have much lower latency overhead (because no need to roundtrip to the Cluster) compared to normal Activity Executions.
However, Local Activities are subject to shorter durations and a lack of rate limiting.

Consider using Local Activities for functions that are the following:

- can be implemented in the same binary as the Workflow that calls them.
- do not require global rate limiting.
- do not require routing to a specific Worker or Worker pool.
- no longer than a few seconds, inclusive of retries.

If it takes longer than 80% of the Workflow Task Timeout (which is 10 seconds by default), the Worker will ask the Cluster to create a new Workflow Task to extend the "lease" for processing the Local Activity.
The Worker will continue doing so until the Local Activity has completed.
This is called Workflow Task Heartbeating.
The drawbacks of long-running Local Activities are:

- Each new Workflow Task results in 3 more Events in History.
- The Workflow won't get notified of new events like Signals and completions until the next Workflow Task Heartbeat.
- New Commands created by the Workflow concurrently with the Local Activity will not be sent to the Cluster until either the Local Activity completes or the next Workflow Task Heartbeat.

Using a Local Activity without understanding its limitations can cause various production issues.
**We recommend using regular Activities unless your use case requires very high throughput and large Activity fan outs of very short-lived Activities.**
