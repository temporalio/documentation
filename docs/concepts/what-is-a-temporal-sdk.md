A Temporal SDK is a language-specific library that offers APIs to do the following:

1. Construct and use a Temporal Client to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.
2. Develop Workflow Definitions
3. Develop Worker Programs

A Temporal SDK enables you to write your application code using the full power of the programming language, while the Temporal Platform handles the durability, availability, and scalability of the application.
