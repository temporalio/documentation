A Temporal SDK is a language-specific library that offers APIs to do the following:

1. Construct and use a Temporal Client to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.
2. Develop Workflow Definitions
3. Develop Worker Programs

A Temporal SDK enables you to write your application code using the full power of the programming language, while the Temporal Platform handles the durability, availability, and scalability of the application.

SDKs are available in the following languages:

- [Go](/docs/go/getting-started)
- [Java](/docs/java/introduction)
- [PHP](/docs/php/introduction)
- [TypeScript](/docs/typescript/introduction)
