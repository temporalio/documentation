In day-to-day conversations, the term Worker is used to denote either a [Worker Program](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-worker-program), a [Worker Process](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-worker-process), or a [Worker Entity](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-worker-Entity).
Temporal documentation aims to be explicit and differentiate between them.
