A Workflow Execution Timeout is the maximum time that a Workflow Execution can be executing (have an Open status) including retries and any usage of Continue As New.

**The default value is âˆž (infinite).**
If this timeout is reached, the Workflow Execution changes to a Timed Out status.
This timeout is different from the [Workflow Run Timeout](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-run-timeout).
This timeout is most commonly used for stopping the execution of a [Temporal Cron Job](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cron-job) after a certain amount of time has passed.
