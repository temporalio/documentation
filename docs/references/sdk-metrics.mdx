:::info SDK metrics

The information on this page is relevant to [Temporal SDKs](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks).

See [Cloud metrics](/cloud/metrics/) for metrics emitted by [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/overview).

See [Cluster metrics](/references/cluster-metrics) for metrics emitted by the [OSS Cluster](/clusters).

Some SDKs may emit metrics beyond what is listed in this SDK Metrics reference.
Only metrics included in this Metrics reference have guaranteed, defined behavior.
Other metrics are considered deprecated, inconsistent or experimental.

:::

The Temporal SDKs emit a set of metrics from Temporal Client usage and Worker Processes.

- [How to emit metrics using the Go SDK](/develop/go/observability#metrics)
- [How to emit metrics using the Java SDK](/develop/java/observability#metrics)
- [How to emit metrics using the Python SDK](/develop/python/observability#metrics)
- [How to emit metrics using the TypeScript SDK](/develop/typescript/observability#metrics)
- [How to emit metrics using the .NET SDK](/develop/dotnet/observability#metrics)

- [How to tune Worker performance based on metrics](/develop/worker-performance)

All metrics are prefixed with `temporal_` before being exported to their configured destination.
(The prefix has been removed in the following reference.)
Currently, some metrics are specific to certain SDKs.

TypeScript, Python, and .NET SDKs metrics are defined in the Core SDK.

PHP and Go metrics are defined in the Go SDK.

Java metrics are defined in the Java SDK
Metrics are defined in the following locations.

- [Core SDK Worker metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/blob/master/core/src/telemetry/metrics.rs)
- [Core SDK Client metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/blob/master/client/src/metrics.rs)
- [Java SDK Worker metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/worker/MetricsType.java)
- [Java SDK Client metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-serviceclient/src/main/java/io/temporal/serviceclient/MetricsType.java)
- [Go SDK Worker and Client metrics](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/c32b04729cc7691f80c16f80eed7f323ee5ce24f/internal/common/metrics/constants.go)

:::note Metric units across SDKs

The unit of measurement for metrics can vary based on which SDK they are being reported from:

**Core-based SDKs:** Metrics of the type Histogram are measured in _milliseconds_ by default.
This can be customized to use seconds for SDKs using [Core SDK](/glossary#core-sdk).
The Core SDK is a shared common core library used by several Temporal SDKs, including TypeScript, Python, and .NET.

**Java and Go SDKs:** Metrics of the type Histogram are measured in _seconds_.

:::

Each metric may have some combination of the following keys attached to them:

- `task-queue`: Task Queue that the Worker Entity is polling
- `namespace`: Namespace the Worker is bound to
- `poller_type`: One of the following:
  - `workflow_task`
  - `activity_task`
  - `nexus_task` (Go and Java only)
  - `sticky_workflow_task`
- `worker_type`: One of the following:
  - `ActivityWorker`
  - `WorkflowWorker`
  - `LocalActivityWorker` (Go and Java only)
  - `NexusWorker` (Go and Java only)
- `activity_type`: The name of the Activity Function the metric is associated with
- `workflow_type`: The name of the Workflow Function the metric is associated with
- `operation`: RPC method name; available for metrics related to Temporal Client gRPC requests

Some keys may not be available in every SDK, and Histogram metrics may have different buckets in each SDK.

This metric is useful for ensuring Activity Tasks are being processed from the queue in a timely manner. Some SDKs may include
the `activity_type` label, but the metric should not vary by type, as it does not influence the rate at which tasks are pulled
from the queue.
