The following is a complete list of possible Commands.

### CompleteWorkflowExecution

This Command is triggered when the Workflow Function Execution returns.
It indicates to the Cluster that the <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Workflow Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Execution?</p><p class="tdlppd">A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution. It is the main unit of execution of a Temporal Application.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Learn more</a></p></div></a> is complete.
The corresponding <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#event">Event<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">What is an Event?</p><p class="tdlppd">Events are created by the Temporal Cluster in response to external occurrences and Commands generated by a Workflow Execution.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#event">Learn more</a></p></div></a> for this Command is one of the few Events that will be the last in a Workflow Execution <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#event-history">Event History<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">What is an Event History?</p><p class="tdlppd">An append log of Events that represents the full state a Workflow Execution.</p><p class="tdlplm"><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#event-history">Learn more</a></p></div></a>.

- Awaitable: No, a Workflow Execution can not await on the action resulting from this Command.
