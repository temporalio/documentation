The following is a complete list of possible Commands.

### CompleteWorkflowExecution

This Command is triggered when the Workflow Function Execution returns.
It indicates to the Cluster that the <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Workflow Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><div class="tdlpc"><p class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Execution?</p><p class="tdlppd">A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution.
