A Failure is Temporal's representation of various types of errors that occur in the system.

There are different types of Failures, and each has a different type in the SDKs and different information in the protobuf messages (which are used to communicate with the Temporal Service and appear in [Event History](/workflows#event-history)).

## Temporal Failure

Most SDKs have a base class that the other Failures extend:

- TypeScript: [TemporalFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.TemporalFailure)
- Java: [TemporalFailure](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/failure/TemporalFailure.html)
- Python: [FailureError](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.exceptions.FailureError.html)
- PHP: [TemporalFailure](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Exception-Failure-TemporalFailure.html)

The base [Failure proto message](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.Failure) has these fields:

- `string message`
- `string stack_trace`
- `string source`: The SDK this Failure originated in (for example, `"TypeScriptSDK"`). In some SDKs, this field is used to rehydrate the call stack into an exception object.
- `Failure cause`: The `Failure` message of the cause of this Failure (if applicable).
- `Payload encoded_attributes`: Contains the encoded `message` and `stack_trace` fields when using a [Failure Converter](/dataconversion#failure-converter).

## Application Failure

Workflow, and Activity, and Nexus Operation code use Application Failures to communicate application-specific failures that happen.
This is the only type of Temporal Failure created and thrown by user code.

- TypeScript: [ApplicationFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.ApplicationFailure)
- Java: [ApplicationFailure](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/failure/ApplicationFailure.html)
- Go: [ApplicationError](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal#ApplicationError)
- Python: [ApplicationError](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.exceptions.ApplicationError.html)
- PHP: [ApplicationFailure](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Exception-Failure-ApplicationFailure.html)
- Proto: [ApplicationFailureInfo](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.ApplicationFailureInfo) and [Failure](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.Failure)

### Errors in Workflows

An error in a Workflow can cause either a **Workflow Task Failure** (the Task will be retried) or a **Workflow Execution Failure** (the Workflow is marked as failed).

Only Workflow exceptions that are Temporal Failures cause the Workflow Execution to fail; all other exceptions cause the Workflow Task to fail and be retried (in Go, any error returned from the Workflow fails the Workflow Execution, and a panic fails the Workflow Task).
Most types of Temporal Failures are raised by the Temporal Service, like a [Cancelled Failure](#cancelled-failure) when the Workflow is Cancelled or an [Activity Failure](#activity-failure) when an Activity Fails.
In contrast, the application developer can explicitly fail the Workflow Execution by throwing an Application Failure (returning any error in Go).

#### Workflow Task Failures

A **Workflow Task Failure** is an unexpected situation failing to process a Workflow Task.
This could be triggered by a non-Temporal exception being raised (panicking in Go) in your Workflow code.
Any exception that does not extend Temporal's `FailureError` exception is considered a Workflow Task Failure.
These types of failures will cause the Workflow Task to be retried until the
Workflow Execution Timeout, which is unlimited by default.

#### Workflow Execution Failures

An `ApplicationError`, an extension of `FailureError`, can be raised in a Workflow to fail the Workflow Execution.
Workflow Execution Failures put the Workflow Execution into the "Failed" state and no more attempts will be made in progressing this execution.
If you are creating custom exceptions you would need to extend the `ApplicationError` class—a child class of `FailureError`.

### Errors in Activities

In Activities, you can either throw an Application Failure or another Error to fail the Activity Task.
In the latter case, the error is converted to an Application Failure.
During conversion, the following Application Failure fields are set:

- `type` is set to the error's type name.
- `message` is set to the error message.
- `non_retryable` is set to false.
- `details` are left unset.
- `cause` is a Failure converted from the error's `cause` property.
- `next_retry_delay` is left unset.
- call stack is copied.

When an [Activity Execution](/activities#activity-execution) (an Activity Execution is the full chain of [Activity Task Executions](/workers#activity-task-execution)) fails, the Application Failure from the last Activity Task is the `cause` field of the [ActivityFailure](#activity-failure).  This Activity Failure is thrown by the Workflow's call to execute the Activity, and this call site is where Activity Failure can be handled by the application developer.

### Errors in Nexus Operations

Nexus Operations can end up in completed, failed, canceled, and timed out states.

Under the hood, the Nexus Operation machinery, breaks up the lifecycle of an Operation into one or more StartOperation requests and completion callbacks and automatically retries these requests as long they fail with retryable errors.

The Workflow-specified schedule-to-close timeout is enforced by the caller's machinery and the only way for an Operation to transition to the timed out state.

Operations can end up in the other three states either when a user handler returns a synchronous response or error, or when an asynchronous Operation (like one backed by a workflow) eventually reaches a terminal state.

A handler can return either retryable or non-retryable errors to indicate to the caller's Nexus machinery whether to retry a given request.
Requests that time out before a response is sent to the caller are automatically retried.

By default, errors are considered retryable, unless specified below:

- Non retryable Application Failures
- Unsuccessful Operation errors that can resolve an operation as either failed or canceled
- [Handler errors](https://github.com/nexus-rpc/api/blob/main/SPEC.md#predefined-handler-errors) with the following types: `BAD_REQUEST`, `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `NOT_FOUND`, and `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`

#### Nexus Operation Task Failures

A Nexus Operation Task Failure is an unexpected situation failing to process a Nexus Operation Task in a handler.
This could be triggered by throwing an unknown error in your Nexus handler code.
These types of failures will cause the Nexus Operation Task to be retried.

#### Nexus Operation Execution Failures

A non-retryable Application Failure can be thrown by a Nexus Operation handler to fail the overall Nexus Operation Execution.
Nexus Operation Execution Failures put the Nexus Operation Execution into the "Failed" state and no more attempts will be made to complete the Nexus Operation.

#### Propagation of Workflow errors

Application Errors thrown from a Workflow created by a Nexus NewWorkflowRunOperation handler, will be automatically propagated to the caller as a non-retryable error and result in a Nexus Operation Execution Failure.

#### Using Failures in a Nexus handler

In a Nexus Operation handler, you can throw an Application Failure, a Nexus Error or another Error to fail the individual Nexus Operation Task or fail the overall Nexus Operation Execution.

Unknown errors are converted to a retryable Application Failure. During conversion, the following fields are set on the Application Failure:

- Non_retryable is set to false.
- Type is set to the error's type name.
- Message is set to the error message.

#### Retryable failures

Retryable Nexus Operation Task failures, like an unknown error, are automatically retried with a built-in Retry Policy.
When a Nexus Task fails, the caller Workflow records an event attempt failure on the pending Nexus Operation and sets the following fields:

- State is set to the new state, for example BackingOff.
- Attempt is set to an incremented count.
- Next_attempt_schedule_time is set when the Nexus Task will be retried.
- Last_attempt_failure is set with the following fields:
  - Message is set to the error message.
  - Failure_info is set to the Application Failure.

For example, an unknown error thrown in a Nexus handler will surface as:

```
temporal workflow describe -w my-workflow-id
...
Pending Nexus Operations: 1

  Endpoint                 myendpoint
  Service                  my-hello-service
  Operation                echo
  OperationID
  State                    BackingOff
  Attempt                  6
  ScheduleToCloseTimeout   0s
  NextAttemptScheduleTime  20 seconds from now
  LastAttemptCompleteTime  11 seconds ago
  LastAttemptFailure       {"message":"unexpected response status: "500 Internal Server Error": internal error","applicationFailureInfo":{}}
```

### Non-retryable

When an Activity or Workflow throws an Application Failure, the Failure's `type` field is matched against a Retry Policy's list of [non-retryable errors](/encyclopedia/retry-policies#non-retryable-errors) to determine whether to retry the Activity or Workflow.
Activities and Workflow can also avoid retrying by setting an Application Failure's `non_retryable` flag to `true`.

When a Nexus Operation handler throws an Application Failure, it is retried by default using a built-in Retry Policy that cannot be customized.
Nexus Operation handlers can avoid retrying by setting an Application Failure's non_retryable flag to true.
When a non-retryable error is returned from a Nexus handler, the overall Nexus Operation Execution is failed and the error is returned to the caller’s Workflow Execution as a Nexus Operation Failure.

### Setting the Next Retry Delay {#activity-next-retry-delay}

By setting the Next Retry Delay for a given Application Failure, you can tell the server to wait that amount of time before trying the Activity or Workflow again.
This will override whatever the Retry Policy would have computed for your specific exception.

Java: [NextRetryDelay](/develop/java/failure-detection#activity-next-retry-delay)
TypeScript: [nextRetryDelay](/develop/typescript/failure-detection#activity-next-retry-delay)
PHP: [NextRetryDelay](/develop/php/failure-detection#activity-next-retry-delay)

### Nexus errors {#nexus-errors}

#### Default mapping

By default, Application Failures thrown from a Nexus Operation handler will be mapped to the following underlying Nexus Failures, based on what non_retryable is set to:

| non_retryable   | Nexus error                | HTTP status code          |
| :-------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| false (default) | HandlerErrorTypeInternal   | 500 Internal Server Error |
| true            | UnsuccessfulOperationError | 424 Failed Dependency     |

#### Use Nexus Errors directly

For improved semantics and mapping to HTTP status codes for external Nexus callers (when supported), we recommend that Nexus Operation handlers throw a Nexus Error directly, which includes the list below with associated retry semantics.

For example the Nexus Go SDK provides

- `nexus.HandlerError(nexus.HandlerErrorType, msg)`
- `nexus.UnsuccessfulOperationError{state, failure}`

#### Retryable Nexus errors

| Nexus error type                  | non_retryable |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------ |
| HandlerErrorTypeResourceExhausted | false         |
| HandlerErrorTypeInternal          | false         |
| HandlerErrorTypeNotImplemented    | false         |
| HandlerErrorTypeUnavailable       | false         |

#### Non-retryable Nexus errors

| Nexus error type                | non_retryable |
| :------------------------------ | :------------ |
| HandlerErrorTypeBadRequest      | true          |
| HandlerErrorTypeUnauthenticated | true          |
| HandlerErrorTypeUnauthorized    | true          |
| HandlerErrorTypeNotFound        | true          |
| UnsuccessfulOperationError      | true          |

## Cancelled Failure

When [Cancellation](/activities#cancellation) of a Workflow, Activity or Nexus Operation is requested, SDKs represent the cancellation to the user in language-specific ways.
For example, in TypeScript, in some cases a Cancelled Failure is thrown directly by a Workflow API function, and in other cases the Cancelled Failure is wrapped in a different Failure.
To check both types of cases, TypeScript has the [isCancellation](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#iscancellation) helper.

When a Workflow, Activity or Nexus Operation is successfully Cancelled, a Cancelled Failure is the `cause` field of the Activity Failure, Nexus Operation Failure or "Workflow failed" error.

- TypeScript: [CancelledFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.CancelledFailure)
- Java: [CanceledFailure](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/failure/CanceledFailure.html)
- Go: [CanceledError](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal#CanceledError)
- Python: [CancelledError](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.exceptions.CancelledError.html)
- PHP: [CanceledFailure](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Exception-Failure-CanceledFailure.html)
- Proto: [CanceledFailureInfo](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.CanceledFailureInfo) and [Failure](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.Failure)

## Activity Failure

An Activity Failure is delivered to the Workflow Execution when an Activity fails.
It contains information about the failure and the Activity Execution; for example, the Activity Type and Activity Id.
The reason for the failure is in the `cause` field.
For example, if an Activity Execution times out, the `cause` is a [Timeout Failure](#timeout-failure).

- TypeScript: [ActivityFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.ActivityFailure)
- Java: [ActivityFailure](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/failure/ActivityFailure.html)
- Go: [ActivityError](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal#ActivityError)
- Python: [ActivityError](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.exceptions.ActivityError.html)
- PHP: [ActivityFailure](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Exception-Failure-ActivityFailure.html)
- Proto: [ActivityFailureInfo](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.ActivityFailureInfo) and [Failure](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.Failure)

## Nexus Operation Failure

A Nexus Operation Failure is delivered to the Workflow Execution when a Nexus Operation fails.
It contains information about the failure and the Nexus Operation Execution; for example, the Nexus Operation name and Nexus Operation ID.
The reason for the failure is in the message and cause (typically an Application Error or a Canceled Error).

- Go: NexusOperationError
- Proto: NexusOperationFailureInfo

A Nexus Operation Failure includes the following fields:

- Endpoint is set to the name of the endpoint.
- Service is set to the name of the service.
- Operation is set to the name of the operation.
- Operation_id is set to the id of the operation, if this is an async operation.
- Scheduled_event_id is set to the caller’s event id that scheduled the operation.
- Message is set to a generic unsuccessful error message.
- Cause is set to the underlying Application Failure with the following fields:
  - Non-retryable is set to true.
  - Type is set to the error's type name.
  - Message is set to the error message.
- Nexus_error_code is set the the underlying Nexus error code.

## Child Workflow Failure

A Child Workflow Failure is delivered to the Workflow Execution when a Child Workflow Execution fails.
It contains information about the failure and the Child Workflow Execution; for example, the Workflow Type and Workflow Id.
The reason for the failure is in the `cause` field.

- TypeScript: [ChildWorkflowFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.ChildWorkflowFailure)
- Java: [ChildWorkflowFailure](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/failure/ChildWorkflowFailure.html)

- Proto: [ChildWorkflowExecutionFailureInfo](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.ChildWorkflowExecutionFailureInfo) and [Failure](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.Failure)

## Timeout Failure

A Timeout Failure represents the timeout of an Activity or Workflow.

When an Activity times out, the last Heartbeat details it emitted is attached.

- TypeScript: [TimeoutFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.TimeoutFailure)
- Java: [TimeoutFailure](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/failure/TimeoutFailure.html)

- Python: [TimeoutError](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.exceptions.TimeoutError.html)
- PHP: [TimeoutFailure](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Exception-Failure-TimeoutFailure.html)
- Proto: [TimeoutFailureInfo](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.TimeoutFailureInfo) and [Failure](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.Failure)

## Terminated Failure

A Terminated Failure is used as the `cause` of an error when a Workflow is terminated, and you receive the error in one of the following locations:

- Inside a Workflow that's waiting for the result of a Child Workflow.
- When waiting for the result of a Workflow on the Client.

In the SDKs:

- TypeScript: [TerminatedFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.TerminatedFailure)
- Java: [TerminatedFailure](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/failure/TerminatedFailure.html)

- PHP: [TerminatedFailure](https://php.temporal.io/classes/Temporal-Exception-Failure-TerminatedFailure.html)
- Proto: [TerminatedFailureInfo](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.TerminatedFailureInfo) and [Failure](https://api-docs.temporal.io/#temporal.api.failure.v1.Failure)

## Server Failure

A Server Failure is used for errors that originate in the Temporal Service.

- TypeScript: [ServerFailure](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/common.ServerFailure)
- Java: [ServerFailure](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/io/temporal/failure/ServerFailure.html)
