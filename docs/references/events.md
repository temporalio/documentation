[Events](/concepts/what-is-an-event) are created by the [Temporal Cluster](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster) in response to external occurrences and [Commands](/concepts/what-is-a-command) generated by a [Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution).
All possible Events that could appear in a Workflow Execution [Event History](/concepts/what-is-an-event-history) are listed below.

### WorkflowExecutionStarted

This is always the first [Event](/concepts/what-is-an-event) in a Workflow Execution Event History.
It indicates that the Cluster received a request to spawn the Workflow Execution.
