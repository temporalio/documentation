[Events](/workflows#event) are created by the [Temporal Cluster](/clusters#) in response to external occurrences and [Commands](/workflows#command) generated by a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution).
All possible Events that could appear in a Workflow Execution [Event History](/workflows#event-history) are listed below.

### WorkflowExecutionStarted

This is always the first [Event](/workflows#event) in a Workflow Execution Event History.
It indicates that the Cluster received a request to spawn the Workflow Execution.
