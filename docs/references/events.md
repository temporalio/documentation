[Events](/concepts/what-is-an-event) are created by the [Temporal Cluster](/concepts/what-is-a-temporal-cluster) in response to external occurrences and [Commands](/concepts/what-is-a-command) generated by a [Workflow Execution](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow-execution).
All possible Events that could appear in a Workflow Execution Event History are listed below.

### WorkflowExecutionStarted

This is always the first Event in a Workflow Execution History. It indicates that the execution was invoked.
