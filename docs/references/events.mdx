[Events](/workflows#event) are created by the [Temporal Service](/clusters) in response to external occurrences and [Commands](/workflows#command) generated by a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution).
All possible Events that could appear in a Workflow Execution [Event History](/workflows#event-history) are listed below.

### WorkflowExecutionStarted

This is always the first [Event](/workflows#event) in a Workflow Execution Event History.
It indicates that the Temporal Service received a request to spawn the Workflow Execution.

### ActivityTaskStarted

This [Event](/workflows#event) type indicates that an [Activity Task Execution](/tasks#activity-task-execution) was started.
The SDK Worker picked up the Activity Task and started processing the [Activity](/activities) invocation.
Note, however, that this Event is not written to History until the terminal Event (like [ActivityTaskCompleted](#activitytaskcompleted) or [ActivityTaskFailed](#activitytaskfailed)) occurs.

| Field              | Description                                                                                                          |

### ActivityTaskTimedOut

This [Event](/workflows#event) type indicates that the Activity has timed out according to the [Temporal Server](/clusters#temporal-server), due to one of these [Activity](/activities) timeouts: [Schedule-to-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-close-timeout) and [Schedule-to-Start Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-start-timeout).

| timeout_type       | The type of timeout that led to this Event, e.g., Start-to-Close, Schedule-to-Close, Schedule-to-Start.     |

You can run a Workflow containing an Activity Execution that takes longer than the Start-to-Close Timeout you set and use a RetryPolicy that sets MaxAttempts to 1 so it does not retry indefinitely.
When the Activity times out, you will observe that the `ActivityTaskTimedOut` Event contains other attributes missing from the documentation, including the type of timeout that led to the Event.

### ActivityTaskCancelRequested

This [Event](/workflows#event) type indicates that a request to [cancel](/activities#cancellation) the [Activity](/activities) has occurred.

### NexusOperationStarted

This Event type indicates that a Nexus Operation Execution was started.
This Event is added to the caller's Workflow History for Asynchronous Nexus Operations, for example those that are backed by a Workflow.
The Event is not added to the caller's Workflow History for Synchronous Nexus Operations, since they transition directly to [NexusOperationCompleted](#nexusoperationcompleted) or another final state such as [NexusOperationFailed](#nexusoperationfailed) when the response is provided synchronously by the Nexus handler.

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                 |

### NexusOperationCompleted

### NexusOperationFailed

This Event type indicates that a Nexus Operation has failed.
The caller's Workflow History records a failed Nexus Operation with this event both for synchronous and asynchronous Nexus Operations.
For example, when a Nexus Handler responds synchronously with a non-retryable error or when a Workflow that backs an Operation fails, resulting in a [WorkflowExecutionFailed](#workflowexecutionfailed) Event.
When an SDK client picks up a Nexus Operation, the Nexus handler asynchronously starts an underlying Workflow, which subsequently results in [WorkflowExecutionFailed](#workflowexecutionfailed).
This Event type contains a Nexus Operation failure.

| Field              | Description                                                                                                   |
