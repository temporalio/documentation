[Events](/workflows#event) are created by the [Temporal Service](/clusters) in response to external occurrences and [Commands](/workflows#command) generated by a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution).
All possible Events that could appear in a Workflow Execution [Event History](/workflows#event-history) are listed below.

### WorkflowExecutionStarted

This is always the first [Event](/workflows#event) in a Workflow Execution Event History.
It indicates that the Temporal Service received a request to spawn the Workflow Execution.

### ActivityTaskStarted

This [Event](/workflows#event) type indicates that an [Activity Task Execution](/workers#activity-task-execution) was started.
The SDK Worker picked up the Activity Task and started processing the [Activity](/activities) invocation.
Note, however, that this Event is not written to History until the terminal Event (like [ActivityTaskCompleted](#activitytaskcompleted) or [ActivityTaskFailed](#activitytaskfailed)) occurs.

| Field              | Description                                                                                                          |

### ActivityTaskTimedOut

This [Event](/workflows#event) type indicates that the Activity has timed out according to the [Temporal Server](/clusters#temporal-server), due to one of these [Activity](/activities) timeouts: [Schedule-to-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-close-timeout) and [Schedule-to-Start Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-start-timeout).

| Field              | Description                                                                                                 |

| timeout_type       | The type of timeout that led to this Event, e.g., Start-to-Close, Schedule-to-Close, Schedule-to-Start.     |

You can run a Workflow containing an Activity Execution that takes longer than the Start-to-Close Timeout you set and use a RetryPolicy that sets MaxAttempts to 1 so it does not retry indefinitely.
When the Activity times out, you will observe that the `ActivityTaskTimedOut` Event contains other attributes missing from the documentation, including the type of timeout that led to the Event.

### ActivityTaskCancelRequested

This [Event](/workflows#event) type indicates that a request to [cancel](/activities#cancellation) the [Activity](/activities) has occurred.
