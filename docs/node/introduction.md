<CustomWarning>

This SDK and associated documentation is in an Alpha stage and may change at any time.

</CustomWarning>

The Node.js SDK is Temporal's newest client SDK for developing with Temporal.
It is designed to work equally well with TypeScript or JavaScript in Node.js.

You can view:

- Node.js Code Samples: https://github.com/temporalio/samples-node
- Full API reference: https://nodejs.temporal.io
- Node.js SDK source: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/temporalio/sdk-node)](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/stargazers) (give us a star!)

## Getting started

You can run "Hello Temporal" locally in under 5 minutes.

:::note Prerequisites

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Node.js 14+</strong>: This project requires Node.js version 14 or later.
</summary>

macOS users: Brew installation of Node.js versions 15.0 to 16.4 does not work with the SDK; instead install the latest Node.js version (16.4.1+) or use nvm

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade node
```

-- OR --

```bash
nvm use 16
```

If you donâ€™t have `nvm` ([Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)), you can [install](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) it with:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>node-gyp</strong>: `npm install -g node-gyp`
</summary>

Install node-gyp:

```bash
npm install -g node-gyp
```

You may have to install some system dependencies first as documented [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation).

_`node-gyp` is a requirement of [`isolated-vm`](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm) the V8 Isolate library which powers this SDK's [deterministic runtime](/docs/node/determinism)_.

</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Temporal Server</strong>: make sure it is running locally!
</summary>

Run Temporal Server (requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git temporal
cd temporal
docker-compose up
```

If you want to run Temporal without Docker, DataDog has created an experimental project called [temporalite](https://github.com/DataDog/temporalite) you can try.

</details>

:::

### Step 1: Create a new project

Use the [package initializer](./package-initializer) to create a new project:

```bash
npx @temporalio/create@latest ./example
cd example
```

This will set up with [the basic Hello World sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-node/tree/main/hello-world).
If you want to start from a different sample, pass the `--sample <sample-name>` argument to the script. For example, running `npx @temporalio/create@latest ./example --sample hello-world-mtls` will download the [sample for connecting to a Temporal Server instance secured with mTLS](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-node/tree/main/hello-world-mtls).

The list of official samples can be found in the [samples-node](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-node) repo.

:::note

`npx` triggers native module compilation which might take a while, `npm` 7 hides the compilation output so it may appear that the installation is stuck, to see the compilation progress export `NPM_CONFIG_FOREGROUND_SCRIPTS=true`.

### Step 2: Run your Workflow

Run the Worker:

```bash
# this runs ts-node src/worker.ts with nodemon to auto-reload on changes
$ npm run start.watch

> temporal-hello-world@0.1.0 start.watch
> nodemon src/worker.ts

[nodemon] 2.0.13
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): src/**/*
[nodemon] watching extensions: ts
[nodemon] starting `ts-node src/worker.ts`

```

> If this step fails, make sure you have the correct version of Node and other prerequisites listed above.

Then start your Workflow:

```bash
$ npm run workflow # alias to ts-node src/exec-workflow.ts
Hello, Temporal!
```

This "Hello, Temporal!" message comes from the combination of:

- [`execute-workflow.ts`](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-node/blob/main/hello-world/src/execute-workflow.ts) passing `'Temporal'` as an argument to the Workflow.
- The [Workflow](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-node/blob/main/hello-world/src/workflows.ts) passing the argument to the Activity.
- The [Activity](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-node/blob/main/hello-world/src/activities.ts) taking the argument as `name` and returning `Hello, ${name}!`.

You can verify this via the INPUT and RESULT fields in Temporal Web (available at [`localhost:8088`](http://localhost:8088/) on the default [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)):

## Next Steps

For a full code walkthrough of the Hello World example that you have spun up here, see our [Hello World documentation](/docs/node/hello-world).

Then you should have a passing knowledge of our Core APIs:

- [Workflows](/docs/node/workflows) and [Activities](/docs/node/activities): How to write Temporal's core orchestration code
  - see [Workflow APIs](/docs/node/workflows) for Signals, Queries, Timers, Child Workflows, Infinite Workflows, and more!
- [Workers and Task Queues](/docs/node/workers): How Workflows and Activities are routed to and executed on machines you control
- [Clients](/docs/node/client): How to start, signal, query, cancel, or otherwise handle Workflows.
