### Logging from Workflows and Activities

#### Activities

Activities run in the standard Node.js environment and can use any Node.js logger.

#### Workflows

Logging from Workflows is tricky for 2 reasons:

1. Workflows run in an isolated JS environment and may not do any I/O
1. Workflow code might get replayed generating duplicate log messages

In order to get around this limitation, use the [External Dependencies](/docs/node/workflow-external-dependencies) mechanism
to inject replay aware functions from the Node.js environment into a Workflow isolate.

### Logs generated by SDK components

The Worker comes with a default logger which defaults to log any messages with level `INFO` and higher to `STDERR` using `console.error`.

The rationale behind this is to minimize Worker dependencies and allow SDK users to bring their own logger.

#### Customizing the default logger

```ts
import {Worker, DefaultLogger} from "@temporalio/worker";

// Set up the DefaultLogger to log only WARNING and ERROR messages with a custom log function
const logger = new DefaultLogger("WARNING", (severity, message, meta) => {
  /* Implement this in order to generate custom log output */
});
const worker = await Worker.create({workDir: __dirname, logger});
```

#### BYOL - Bring your own logger

A common logging use case is logging to a file to be picked up by a collector like the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/nodejs/?tab=winston30).

```ts
import {Worker} from "@temporalio/worker";
import winston from "winston";

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: "info",
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [new transports.File({filename: "/path/to/worker.log"})],
});
const worker = await Worker.create({workDir: __dirname, logger});
```
