# Activities

In Temporal, Activities are typically used to interact with external resources, like making an HTTP request.
Unlike [Workflows](/docs/node/determinism), Activities execute in the standard Node.js environment, not an [isolate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isolated-vm).
So any code that needs to talk to the outside world needs to be in an Activity.

### Overview

Below is a simple Activity that accepts a string parameter, appends a word to it, and returns the result.
The Temporal Node SDK looks for any `.js` files in the `lib/activities` directory, and automatically registers any exported functions as Activities.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
defaultValue="ts"
values={[
{label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
{label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'},
]
}>

<TabItem value="ts">

```typescript
export async function greet(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js">

```javascript
"use strict";

async function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
exports.greet = greet;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Under the hood, the Temporal Node SDK uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle your Workflows before running them.
This [may cause issues with certain npm modules](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/masteringjs/issues/why-i-m-not-using-webpack-for-lambda-functions-anymore-266010).

### Importing and Using

You can import the above `greet()` Activity in a Workflow as shown below, assuming that the `greet` function is in the `lib/activities/greeter.js` file.

```typescript
import {greet} from "@activities/greeter";
```

You can also use `require()` as shown below.

```javascript
const {greet} = require("@activities/greeter");
```

When you import an Activity function from a Workflow, the Node SDK replaces the Activity function with a stubbed function that schedules the Activity on the Temporal server.
For example, if you log `greet.toString()` in the previous example, you won't see the contents of the `greet()` function from `lib/activities/greeter.js`.
Instead, you'll see a function that calls the Node SDK's internal `scheduleActivity()` function.

:::info

Currently, you need to use the `@activities` prefix.
Do **not** import your Activity by using the `'../activities/greeter'` path; otherwise your Activity executes in the same V8 isolate as your Workflow, and your Activity is subject to the same restrictions as your Workflow.

## Heartbeating

Long running activities should heartbeat their progress back to the Workflow.
This has not yet been implemented in the Node SDK.
