## What is a Query?

[**Queries**](/docs/concepts/queries) provide a mechanism to retrieve data OUT from a running Workflow.

## How to use Queries

### How to define a Query

To add Query handlers to a Workflow, add a `queries` property to the exported Workflow object:

<!--SNIPSTART nodejs-blocked-interface-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

### How to handle a Query

Query handlers can return any value.

<!--SNIPSTART nodejs-blocked-workflow-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

### How to make a Query

> NOTE: You may query both running and completed Workflows.

Use the name of the function you defined:

```ts
const client = new WorkflowClient();
const workflow = client.createWorkflowHandle(unblockOrCancel, {
  taskQueue: 'test',
});
await workflow.start();
await workflow.query.isBlocked(); // this gets data out of the Workflow
```
