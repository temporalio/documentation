Use [`start_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#start_activity) to start an Activity and return its handle, [`ActivityHandle`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.activityhandle). Use [`execute_activity()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.html#execute_activity) to return the results.

You must provide either `schedule_to_close_timeout` or `start_to_close_timeout`.

`execute_activity()` is a shortcut for `await start_activity()`. An asynchronous `execute_activity()` helper is provided which takes the same arguments as `start_activity()` and `await`s on the result. `execute_activity()` should be used in most cases unless advanced task capabilities are needed.

```python
@workflow.defn
class YourWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            your_activity, name, schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5)
        )
```
