In order for an Activity to be notified of cancellation requests, you must invoke [`heartbeat()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.activity.html#heartbeat).

```python
    @activity.defn
    async def some_activity() -> str:
        activity.heartbeat("heartbeat details!")
```

In addition to obtaining cancellation information, Heartbeats also support detail data that persists on the server for retrieval during Activity Retry. If an Activity calls `heartbeat(123, 456)` and then fails and is retried, `heartbeat_details` will return an iterable containing `123` and `456` on the next run.
