The Temporal CLI (tctl) is a command-line tool that you can use to interact with a Temporal Cluster.
It can perform [Namespace](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-namespace) operations (such as register, update, and describe) and [Workflow](/docs/concepts/what-is-a-workflow) operations (such as start
Workflow, show Workflow History, and Signal Workflow).
