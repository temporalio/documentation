:::info TRY THE DEV GUIDE

The [Developer's guide](/application-development) is new and is the focus moving forward.

The documentation for the SDKs linked from this page might still contain some information that is not yet represented in the Developer's guide, and new information in the Developer's guide might not be available in older docs.

We encourage users to use both sets of documentation at this time.
