# Temporal documentation

Hello, World!

Welcome to Temporal's documentation repository!

This repository contains a large chunk of the Temporal information corpus.

### Current component versioning philosophy

Temporal includes many different components and core dependencies. Many components are independently versioned, meaning that they document their stability and support for their own dependencies. The [Temporal Go SDK reference](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk?tab=versions) provides a good example of document versioning.

The goal of this information set, in regards to versioning, is to remain “current.” That is, this information should serve the needs of Temporal’s user base as best it can based on what is/has recently happened across all the Temporal's components.

Whenever possible, we make explicit call outs to support, stability, and dependency information.
