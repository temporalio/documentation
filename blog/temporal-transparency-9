**Latest Release at Time of Writing:** V1.2.1

Hey Temporal community, it's Friday again! It's been a long week with *ahem* a lot of other things going on in real life, but work has continued apace on Temporal.

# Update November 6, 2020

It's been a while since we published one of these updates, but in our defence, we were busy: 

- [Announcing Temporal v1.0](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/temporal-v1-announcement), our first production-ready release
- [Announcing our Seed and Series A rounds](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/funding-announcement) led by Amplify and Sequoia
- Shipping [our new Landing Page](http://temporal.io/) (ft. a well received [2 minute explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-18XztyN6c&feature=emb_title)) and [three case studies with Box, Checkr, and Coinbase](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/tags/case-study) (fun thing we noticed, they all have [blue logos](https://www.logomaker.com/blog/2017/09/27/blue-logos/))
- [PostgreSQL 9.6 support](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.2.1) (`v1.1.x` included schema changes for our MySQL and Cassandra support - see [release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.1.1) for migration tools)

The team has grown some (including me!) and [we're absolutely hiring](https://www.temporal.io/careers/)!

## Authentication is Coming

Temporal is a highly business critical system component, so security is paramount. 
While commmunication is already encrypted with [TLS](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/configure-temporal-server/#tls), 
and you could always put Temporal behind a reverse proxy,
one of our longest standing requests has been for an authentication/authorization layer for Temporal, in particular Temporal Web. 
This is what we are tackling first, 
as it happens to also be necessary for [the upcoming Temporal Cloud](https://temporal.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2334a0f23e55fd1840613755d&id=bbbbd4709f) service offering. 

It's not ready for release yet, but we'd like to share how we're shipping this major feature:

- Diverge:
  - **Collecting Requirements**: [Ryland](https://twitter.com/taillogs) had been meticulously collecting feedback from prospective users and customers for the past 6 months. Having this "CRM" (entirely done in Notion) ensured that we started with a strong idea of what our customers' most common requirements would be. For example, we determined that while many companies did use SAML and LDAP for authentication, virtually everyone used the OAuth/OpenID Connect (OIDC) open standard today ([more info on OAuth and OIDC here](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc)). We were also mindful that we ideally would develop a solution that would work for both the self-hosted open-source version of Temporal, and for the coming closed-source, open-core Temporal Cloud offering.
  - **Comparable Research**: Sometimes customers don't tell you what they want. It can help to supplement customer research with comparable products to find ideas and perspectives we never considered. We did a broad search of peer tools, which offered an even broader range of options, including the controversial "[The Prometheus project takes the stance that server side security features are outside its scope]( https://www.robustperception.io/prometheus-security-authentication-authorization-and-encryption)". Our search also showed that a surprising number of tools offered Certificate Authority auth, which didn't feel like the developer experience we wanted to offer. I was quite impressed by [the wide range of auth options offered by Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/).
- Converge:
  - **Narrowing Scope**: One of the most impactful things you can do to ship faster is to say no as much as possible during the design phase. 
    - [Maxim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fateev/) suggested offering authentication within the `tctl` CLI as well, but it would have involved crossing language and client-server boundaries that would have added undue complexity. 
    - [Sergey](https://dev.to/temporalio/why-i-joined-temporal-19dg) also had the retrospectively brilliant insight that most customers would demand OIDC Single Sign-On eventually. If we built our own username/password solution, (possible, since Temporal has a persistence layer) it would be a lot of effort and it wouldn't be used by enterprises anyway. We decided that we would go all in on OIDC Single Sign-On. 
    - Finally, we saw that Grafana had a wide range of OAuth options because they were incrementally adopted over the span of 4 years - we as a greenfield solution had the opportunity to leapfrog all that to benefit from their years of customer feedback.
  - **Researching Implementation**: Temporal Web is in Node.js, and the dominant authentication library has been [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) for years. After [confirming nothing had changed](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1315754745412284416), we went with the obvious choice. In my research I had figured that we would pursue [Okta](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-okta-oauth) and [Auth0](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-auth0) integration first, but [Ruslan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/feedmeapples) found a [`node-openid-client`](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client) that would fit our generic OAuth requirement found during the comparative research and scope definition phases :tada:
 
We are currently in the implementation phase, and just did our first internal demo of the full authentication process this week.

It felt slightly surreal to be the first people to "log in to Temporal", though that is no exaggeration. A normal process might also have involved some UI design to ensure a delightful and accessible frontend experience, but we don't yet have inhouse design talent at Temporal (want to send anyone our way?) and are holding off on that for a possible future total design revamp.

## Conclusion

We are working hard to bring you authentication and other top feature requests you are asking for. If you'd like to receive updates on Temporal Cloud, do make sure to [sign up for our mailing list](https://temporal.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2334a0f23e55fd1840613755d&id=bbbbd4709f).
