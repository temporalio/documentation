In addition to writing unit and integration tests, debugging your Workflows is also a very valuable testing tool.
You can debug your Workflow code using a debugger provided by your favorite Java IDE.

Note that when debugging your Workflow code, the Temporal Java SDK includes deadlock detection which fails a Workflow Task in case the code blocks over a second without relinquishing execution control.
Because of this you can often encounter the `PotentialDeadlockException` Exception while stepping through Workflow code during debugging.

To alleviate this issue, you can set the `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` environment variable to true before debugging your Workflow code. Make sure to set `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` to true only during debugging.

## How to debug in a development environment {#debug-in-a-development-environment}

In addition to the normal development tools of logging and a debugger, you can also see what’s happening in your Workflow by using the [Web UI](/web-ui) or [`tctl`](/tctl-v1).

## How to debug in a production environment {#debug-in-a-production-environment}

You can debug production Workflows using:

- [Web UI](/web-ui)
- [tctl](/tctl-v1)
- [Replay](/dev-guide/java/testing#replay)
- [Tracing](/dev-guide/java/observability#tracing)
- [Logging](/dev-guide/java/observability#logging)

You can debug and tune Worker performance with metrics and the [Worker performance guide](/dev-guide/worker-performance).
For more information, see [Observability ▶️ Metrics](/dev-guide/java/observability#metrics) for setting up SDK metrics.

Debug Server performance with [Cloud metrics](/cloud/metrics/) or [self-hosted Server metrics](/self-hosted-guide/production-checklist#scaling-and-metrics).
