# Temporal Documentation
> Comprehensive resources for building and operating resilient applications using the Temporal Platform and Durable Execution.

## Overview
Temporal is a scalable and reliable runtime platform that guarantees the Durable Execution of your application code. It allows you to develop applications as if failures don't exist, ensuring your code runs reliably even when encountering problems like network outages or server crashes that would typically be catastrophic.

At its core, Temporal is:

- A platform for Durable Execution, maintaining the state and progress of application Workflows even in the face of failure
- A runtime for reentrant processes that are resumable, recoverable, and reactive
- An orchestration system that breaks complex processes into smaller tasks that run concurrently or sequentially

Temporal applications are built using an abstraction called Workflows. You write these Workflows in general-purpose programming languages like Go, Java, TypeScript, Python, PHP, .NET, and Ruby. The same code runs at runtime, so you can use your familiar tools and libraries without needing special DSLs or configuration-based workflows.

Temporal handles infrastructure concerns and failure recovery automatically, letting developers focus on business logic. Temporal applications are more reliable, easier to build and operate, and often require 40–60% fewer lines of code.
